Relationships among underlying dimensions of human resource management practices and manufacturing performance are examined. The study found support for the proposed framework, suggesting that human resource management practices can be grouped into five distinct factors, four of which are associated with specific manufacturing competitive dimensions (quality, flexibility, cost and time). The remaining HRM factor is generic. The four priority-specific HRM factors are strongly related to their respective manufacturing performance dimensions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper attempts to identify which work force management practices contribute to better managerial performance when the emphasis on flexibility is high. A contingency model depicting a moderating effect of the emphasis on flexibility on the relationship between work force management practices and managerial performance is proposed. The theoretic-deductive approach is used to develop the study hypotheses, which are tested using data from 483 individuals in 99 manufacturing plants in the United States. The results of the regression analyses suggest that the better performing manufacturing managers strongly demonstrate the relationship-oriented practices, such as team building, supporting, networking, inspiring, recognizing, etc., and participative leadership and delegation practices, when the emphasis on flexibility is high. Furthermore, as the emphasis on flexibility increases, the higher performing manufacturing managers relegate their traditional responsibilities, such as monitoring, problem solving, etc., to their employees.

Their first effect is on product cost - in some cases, low-yields can cause costs to double or worse. Yet measuring only costs can substantially underestimate the importance of yield improvement. We show that yields are especially important in periods of constrained capacity, such as new product ramp-up. Our analysis is illustrated with numerical examples taken from hard disk drive manufacturing. A three percentage point increase in yields can be worth about 6% of gross revenue and 17% of contribution. In fact, an eight percentage point improvement in process yields can outweigh a US$20/h increase in direct labor wages. Therefore, yields, in addition to or instead of labor costs, should be a focus of attention when making decisions such as new factory siting and type of automation. The paper also provides rules fbr when to rework, and shows that cost minimization logic can again give wrong answers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Ideally, these pricing incentives can lead to lower costs for both the buyer and the seller. In this paper, a situation is examined where a steel distributor faces stiff competition in its highly undifferentiated service offerings and price is the primary factor in attracting sales. A model is developed that quantifies the benefits to the supplier from obtaining advanced commitments from downstream customers. This model can be used to suggest the maximum price discount that can be offered to customers to encourage them to commit to their orders in advance. Careful balancing of the advanced ordering time with the price discount can lead to cost reductions for both members of the supply channel. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

While the potential benefits of flexibility are familiar, the concept of flexibility itself is not well-understood. Neither practitioners nor academics agree upon, or know, how flexibility can be gauged or measured in its totality. Consequently, this study seeks to provide a framework for understanding this complex concept and to create a theoretical foundation for the development of generalizable measures for manufacturing flexibility. With this objective in mind, we first critically examine diverse streams of literature to define four constituent elements of flexibility: range number (R-W), range-heterogeneity (R-H), mobility (M), and uniformity (U). The R-H element is new, and has not been proposed before in prior literature. These four elements can be applied to consistently define different types or dimensions of flexibility. Definitions for 10 flexibility dimensions pertaining to manufacturing are thus obtained. These definitions serve a dual purpose. First, they capture the domain of flexibility. Second, we show in this study how these definitions can be used to generate scale items, thereby facilitating the development of generalizable manufacturing flexibility measures. Several research avenues that can be explored once such measures are developed are also highlighted. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We believe that the time is ripe for an analysis of the OM research agenda in the decade of the 90's. In this study, we examine operations management research methodologies and output during the period 1992-1997. Amoako-Gyampah and Meredith [Amoako-Gyampah, K., Meredith, J.R., 1989. Journal of Operations Management 8, 250-262] published a study in which they examined operations management research output from 1982 through 1987. Our objectives are to examine the state of operations management research in the 1990s from the standpoint of topics and methodologies to look for trends, and to determine implications for future research. We assessed the state of research in operations management by examining the research topics addressed and the methodologies used in a subset of seven academic journals that are representative of publications in operations management research. We also surveyed pipeline research in the operations management area by analyzing the topics discussed in national conferences attended by operations management academicians and researchers. Our findings show some significant changes in the kind of research being performed in the 1990s vs. the 1980s. Greater interest in strategy and quality are now apparent in the literature. OM research in the 1990s is also more integrative in nature. We were surprised to find no apparent shift away from modeling solution methods nor any significant shift toward empirical methodologies.

Although this phenomenon is known to exist in practice, academic research has not adequately investigated this new form of competition. In this research, we develop a configurational model for classifying mass customizers based on customer involvement in design and product modularity. We validate this typology through an empirical analysis and classification of 126 mass customizers. We also explore manufacturing systems and performance implications of the various mass customization configurations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Configurations in manufacturing strategy: a review and directions for future research. Journal of Operations Management 16 (4) 427-439]. Using data from 196 respondents in 98 manufacturing units, this study develops a taxonomy of small manufacturers based on their emphasis on several competitive priorities. The annual sales for 64% of the participating units in this study are below US$50 million, which is on the lower side as compared to other studies in this area [cf., Miller, J.G., Roth, A.V., 1994. A taxonomy of manufacturing strategies. Management Science 40 (3) 285-304]. The study findings indicate that different groups of manufacturers - Do All, Speedy Conformers, Efficient Conformers, and Starters - emphasize different sets of competitive priorities, even within the same industry. Further, the Do All types, who emphasize all four competitive priorities, seem to perform better on customer satisfaction than their counterparts in the Starters group. The above findings lend support to the sandcone model but contradict the traditional trade-off model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The effectiveness of the classification scheme is tested by demonstrating the link between the objectives, competitive priorities, and performance. This study also identifies eight underlying factors of competitive priorities in low-contact services. Furthermore, discriminant analysis on competitive priority dimensions shows that low-contact services consist of multiple groups and therefore should not be lumped into one group in any analysis scheme.

The typology links strategic operational objectives to the decision to de-couple work between the front and back offices of a service system. Four specific ideal types of a strategy/de-coupling mix are described; each of which has distinct operational, marketing and human resource ramifications. A type that has had significant representation in traditional literature is the "Cost Leader" type, where back-office activities are de-coupled from the front office for the purpose of lowering costs. Another traditional type representative of the craftsman legacy is the "Personal Service" type, which retains back-office tasks in the front office to pursue non-cost-oriented strategic goals. Theoretical and empirical evidence is also given for two non-traditional types: the "Kiosk" type, where all tasks remain in the front office to achieve lower costs, and the "Focused Professional" type, which de-couples front- and back-office activities to enable front-office workers to provide higher service, rather than to reduce costs. Empirically, retail bank lending systems are analyzed to support the typology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A contributing factor is that the process industries have traditionally been lumped together and contrasted from the discrete industries as a whole, thus leading to misunderstandings regarding individual process industries. From site interviews and the literature, we identified four critical dimensions - planning resource requirements (for materials and capacity), tracking resource consumption, control of work-in-process (WIP), and degree of computerization - represented by seven variables by which to contrast and analyze process industries. Based on in-depth field studies of 19 diverse process plants, we find that there exist at least four distinct types of process industry P&IM systems: (1) simple, (2) common, (3) WIP-controlled, and (4) computerized.

"Prevention", "hard maintenance integration" and "soft maintenance integration" were identified as key maintenance variables. Data were collected from 253 Swedish manufacturing companies, and three distinct clusters were identified. "Proactive Maintainers" emphasized preventive maintenance policies. "IT Maintainers" relied on computerized and company-wide integrated information systems for maintenance. "Maintenance Laggers" emphasized all maintenance dimensions to lesser extent than the others. The importance of maintenance prevention and integration differ between contexts. There were subtle performance differences across identified configurations, but preventive and integrated maintenance were more important for companies seeking competitive process control and flexibility. There existed no group with any great emphasis on all three maintenance dimensions, but attaining truly high performance may require a rare mix of the three dimensions. This mix of variables could constitute a hypothesized "World Class Maintenance" group. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Building on extant technology management literature and the organizational theories of information processing and interdependence, we carefully characterize the three dimensions of the typology: the technology uncertainty of the technology that is transferred, the organizational interaction between the technology source and recipient, and transfer effectiveness. Appropriate matches of technology uncertainty and organizational interaction result in four archetypal cases called "transfer process types", which represent the most effective approaches to technology transfer. Real-life examples of effective and ineffective matches are presented, and implications of the typology for future research and practice are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

To meet these needs, organizations are adopting time-based manufacturing practices to cut time and improve performance. The central tenet of this study is that rime-based manufacturers employ traditional work system practices including standardization, formalization, and routinization plus integration to improve competitiveness. This study measures the levels of time-based manufacturing practices, work system practices, and competitive capabilities of 265 firms. The results indicate that firms with high levels of time-based manufacturing practices tend to have high levels of standardization and formalization as well as integration. Firms with high levels of standardization and integration tended to have enhanced competitive capabilities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper explores and develops the concept of enterprise logistics [Greis, N.P., Kasarda, J.D,, 1997. Enterprise logistics in the information age. California Management Review 39 (3), 55-78] as a tool for integrating the logistics activities both within and between the strategically aligned organizations of the extended enterprise. Specifically, this paper examines the fit between an organization's enterprise logistics integration capabilities and its supply chain structure. Using a configurations approach, we test whether globally dispersed network organizations that adopt enterprise logistics practices are able to achieve higher levels of organizational performance. Results indicate that enterprise logistics is a necessary tool for the coordination of supply chain operations that are geographically dispersed around the world. However, for a pure network structure, a high level of enterprise logistics integration alone does not guarantee improved organizational performance. The paper ends with a discussion of managerial implications and directions for future research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

They are drastically different in their targets of improvement, visibility, and techniques. In this paper, we establish a framework for identifying the synergistic linkages of design and process management to the operational quality outcomes during the manufacturing process (internal quality) and upon the field usage of the products (external quality). Through a study of quality practices in 418 manufacturing plants from multiple industries, we empirically demonstrate that both design and process management efforts have an equal positive impact on internal quality outcomes such as scrap, rework, defects, performance, and external quality outcomes such as complaints, warranty, litigation, market share. A detailed contingency analysis shows that the proposed model of synergies between design and process management holds true for large and small firms; for firms with different levels of TQM experience; and in different industries with varying levels of competition, logistical complexity of production, or production process characteristics. Finally, the results also suggest that organizational learning enables mature TQM firms to implement both design and process efforts more rigorously and their synergy helps these firms to attain better quality outcomes. These findings indicate that, to attain superior quality outcomes, firms need to balance their design and process management efforts and persevere with long-term implementation of these efforts. Because the study spans all of the manufacturing sectors (SIC 20 through 39), these conclusions should help firms in any industry revisit their priorities in terms of the relative efforts in design management and process management.

Based on prior field observations, organizational theory and product development literature, we pose hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of the project execution methods of formality, project management autonomy and resource flexibility. A cross-sectional survey sample of 120 completed new product development projects from a variety of assembled products industries is analyzed via hierarchical moderated regression. We find that the project execution methods are positively associated with project execution success. Further, these methods are effective singly and collectively, suggesting that firms can ''balance firmness and flexibility" in product development via appropriate execution methods. Surprisingly, the effectiveness of these methods is not contingent on the product or process technology novelty inherent in a given development project. The findings suggest that firms should adopt high levels of these approaches, and that a variety of projects can be managed using broadly similar project execution methods. The findings also suggest limitations on the application of organizational information processing theory to the context of product development projects. Directions for additional theory development are outlined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Stochastic patient demands for these beds and stochastic service times in their utilization make managing that resource a complex problem lacking an easy solution. The current practice in one Hong Kong hospital is for the ICU administrator to exploit the fact that there are some patients whose admission to the unit can be postponed. These are patients scheduled for an elective surgery that can be cancelled. One way to minimize the number of cancelled surgeries is to reserve some of the unit's beds for the exclusive use of the elective-surgery patients. We evaluate various bed-reservation schemes via a simulation model that is based on this ICU's historical data, and demonstrate the tradeoffs that each requires among various relevant system-performance measures. We further show how this information can be summarized in a classic efficient frontier. This frontier provides a useful medium through which the ICU administrator can communicate the rationale behind the chosen bed-allocation system to the surgeons and the ICU physicians, in an attempt to resolve the potential conflicts between them.

Minor accidents can interfere with production in a variety of ways, and a serious accident can shut down an entire operation. In this context, questions about the causes of workplace accidents are highly relevant. There is a popular notion that employees' unsafe acts are the primary causes of workplace accidents, but a number of authors suggest a perspective that highlights influences from operating and social systems. The study described herein addresses this subject by assessing steelworkers' responses to a survey about social, technical, and personal factors related to safe work behaviors. Results provide evidence that a chain reaction of technical and social constructs operate through employees to influence safe behaviors. These results demonstrate that safety hazards, safety culture, and production pressures can influence safety efficacy and cavalier attitudes, on a path leading to safe or unsafe work behaviors. Based on these results, we conclude with prescriptions for operations managers and others who play roles in the causal sequence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Remanufacturing systems are widespread in the United States and are profitable. However, the management of production planning and control activities can differ greatly from management activities in traditional manufacturing. We report on managerial remanufacturing practices via a survey of production planning and control activities at remanufacturing firms in the United States. Production planning and control activities are more complex for remanufacturing firms due to uncertainties from stochastic product returns, imbalances in return and demand rates, and the unknown condition of returned products. We identify and discuss seven complicating characteristics that require significant changes in production planning and control activities. We also describe the research opportunities that exist for each of the complicating characteristics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

That is, a store that combines high product variety with a small footprint. Retail management desires smaller stores to provide the strategic benefits of convenience and speed to customers, but desires larger stores to provide high product variety. Noting the benefits of smaller, more numerous stores, several retailers well known for their extremely large store size recently have begun experimenting with a small store format. Traditional retail inventory management policies, however, have difficulty combining high variety and small store size. Here, the potential advantages of the dense store type are explored. To facilitate this exploration, inventory policies are developed to help manage small stores by increasing their product density. Results based on grocery industry data indicate that the heuristics compare favorably to optimality and permit the dense store concept to potentially achieve substantial gains compared to current practice.

Yet, most of these studies are either conceptual in nature or actual case studies. The primary objective of this research is to test the impact of a supply management orientation (SMO) on the suppliers' operational performance and buyers' competitive priorities (cost, quality, delivery, flexibility). Three major research hypotheses associated with SMO, Supplier Performance (SP), and Buyer Performance (BP) are tested using a confirmatory structural equation modeling approach. The results of this research support the conclusion that an improvement (increase) in the SMO improves both the suppliers' and buyers' performance (i.e., a win-win situation for the supply chain). In addition, the influence of SMO on delivery- and quality-related performance is more statistically significant than on cost or flexibility performance. In fact, when volume and process flexibility are top competitive priorities, a supply chain management orientation may not be an effective way to achieve the desired flexibility. The article ends by discussing other conclusions and suggests directions for future research. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Although it is obvious that air carriers use airports, few studies have focused on airport operational efficiency. This empirical study evaluates the operational efficiencies of 44 major U.S. airports using data envelopment analysis and some of its recent developments. Various airport characteristics are evaluated to determine their relationship to an airport's efficiency. Efficiency measures are based on four resource input measures including airport operational costs, number of airport employees, gates and runways, and five output measures including operational revenue, passenger flow, commercial and general aviation movement, and total cargo transportation. The results of this study have operational as well as public policy implications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

On theory in operations management. Journal of Operations Management, 17, 97-113] can be extended to apply to a broader range of operations management issues. It extends the scope of the proposed theory to include a "between-firm" level analysis which can be useful in assessing a firm's competitive position and for strategic decision making. In addition, this paper provides a link between the resource-based view of organizations that has gained some prominence in the strategy literature and the proposed theory of performance frontiers. This paper argues that the operating frontiers of organizations represent unique resources and they are more important than the asset frontiers in achieving a competitive advantage because these unique resources are valuable, rare and specific to a given firm, and they are difficult to replicate. Future research directions and research methods focusing on the internal resources of competitive advantage are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we examine measures commonly used to assess operations strategy and advanced manufacturing technology in survey-based research. Examining two measures provides the ability to examine problems common to many of the measures used in operations management research. In addition, the two measures are addressing two different levels of strategic analysis: competitive priorities and a specific structural decision that (should) support these priorities. This should give us a broader understanding of the measurement issues we are facing as a field. We argue that while many of the commonly employed measures display many worthwhile properties, further refinement of measures and methods is needed to improve the field as a whole. Suggestions to improve measures and methods used in the field are then offered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This research develops a conceptual model of manufacturing strategy from the literature and tests the model using data from a sample of manufacturers in three industries in the United States. This research contributes to manufacturing strategy literature in four ways. First, it supports empirically a model of manufacturing strategy that is predominant in the conceptual literature. Second, it demonstrates that the strategic linkages in manufacturing businesses are clearer among good performers than poor performers. Third, this research suggests that competitive strategy acts as a mediator between an organization's environment and its manufacturing strategy. Fourth, the findings suggest that the relationship between competitive strategy and performance is mediated by manufacturing strategy. These last two findings have important implications for approaching research in manufacturing strategy in the future. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we examine whether production line labor productivity and conformance quality decline as the range of models produced and the heterogeneity of production volume increase in a factory designed for high volume production of a narrow range of models. We use the organizational nature of production lines to argue that the performance of focused production lines will decline when the lines adopt new manufacturing tasks that are outside the scope of the absorptive capacity developed through the execution of their prior focused manufacturing task, but not otherwise. The study examines four years of data from 16 production lines of a compressor manufacturing factory of the Copeland Corporation. Our statistical analysis identifies limits to change, suggests paths to successfully changing the manufacturing requirements of a focused factory, and places the operations strategy discussion of focused factories in a dynamic environment.

In particular, the use and effectiveness of various technologies and their computer-based integration are investigated in the light of three emerging principles: (i) strategic multi-focusedness, (ii) process integration across functions, and (iii) process ownership. Together, these principles are referred to as Strategically Flexible Production (SFP). In an international sample of 392 manufacturing units from the metal-working industry, the use of AMT is analyzed in three groups: core adopters, partial adopters or non-adopters of SFP. Data show that while core adopters do not use stand-alone AMT more than the other groups, they have a higher level of computer integration (CI), in particular in their forefront departments. However, the use of integrating technologies varies much within the core adopters, suggesting that SFP does not necessarily require massive information technology (IT) support. This is further confirmed by the analysis of performance improvements.:The mere adoption of stand-alone AMT per se does not provide companies with superior improvements in performance. On the contrary, SFP alone or combined with a higher level of integration of stand-alone AMT fosters increased time responsiveness. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Trends in the frequency of IOM articles published and in topical coverage are identified based on research appearing in the journal set reviewed. A framework is developed and presented for classifying the IOM research literature by topical area and scope. Based on the articles reviewed, IOM research is found to focus most on industrialized countries and regions. There is need for empirical studies that span a wider range of countries in order to glean broader insights and to develop generalized theories of international operations management. A number of issues are identified for possible future research. The IOM literature from the journal set is reviewed and the comprehensive set of bibliographic references included provides both academicians and practitioners with a useful source of information to draw from. As identified, much of the work in international operations management seems motivated by a desire to provide firms with an economic benefit. While this is undoubtedly worthwhile, the objective of IOM research could be broadened to encompass social and economic goals of non-profit organizations as well as international agencies such as the United Nations.

It was introduced in 1988 as the foundation for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The framework was significantly revised in 1992 and 1997. In order to test the validity of the theoretical model underlying the Baldrige framework as it has evolved over the years, we take the approach of analyzing the constructs upon which the Baldrige categories are based. Path analysis is used to test the fit of each of the three major frameworks, and the sums of direct effects are used to estimate the category weights implied by each of the path models. We found that all three frameworks were a good fit with the Baldrige frameworks for those years, and that both the 1992 and 1997 frameworks improved upon the foundation established by the 1988 framework. Thus, we conclude that appropriate adaptations to the Baldrige framework have been made over the years. We describe the implications for practitioners, in terms of critical success factors, and make recommendations for further minor modifications to the Baldrige framework.

Managers have frequently justified investments in SPC by citing and/or demonstrating the improvements in quality and costs from the effective implementation and practice of SPC. This paper complements this rationalization by presenting conceptual arguments and empirical evidence to further our understanding of the motivational effects that result from the deployment of SPC within production environments. Several hypotheses derived from relating the deployment of SPC to process operators' jobs and their affective reactions to work are tested using data provided by 100 process operators. The empirical results, generated from applying path analysis, suggest that the effective implementation and practice of SPC, in fact, would create more enriched jobs for process operators that lead to higher levels of work motivation and job satisfaction.

However, many researchers believe and argue conceptually the value of understanding the joint implementation and effect of manufacturing programs. This study investigates the practices of the three programs simultaneously. We find that there is evidence supporting the compatibility of the practices in these programs and that manufacturing performance is associated with the level of implementation of both socially- and technically-oriented practices of the three programs.

The entire population of first-tier suppliers to a Korean auto assembler was surveyed to measure use of quality management practices. Useable returns were received from 25% of the suppliers surveyed. To measure conformance quality and overall rating, suppliers were categorized into high, medium, and low performing groups based on the buying company's data. Multivariate analysis of variance was done using general linear model (GLM-MANOVA) to explore differences in the high-, medium-, and low-performing supplier groups based on their use of quality management practices. No statistically significant differences were found when suppliers were categorized based on conformance quality. However, when categorized based on overall rating, the highest rated suppliers were found to emphasize process management and employee satisfaction to a greater degree than the lowest rated suppliers.

However, the effectiveness of these electronic technologies has not been rigorously assessed, especially for gathering data from establishment-level surveys (i.e. firm- or plant-level). To that end, a stratified sample of large and small, service and manufacturing firms was constructed, followed by random assignment to one of four survey technologies: mail, fax, PC disk-by-mail and Web-page survey (combined with e-mail notification). For each treatment, managers are queried about their use of forecasting characteristics, yielding a sample of 118 firms. Unfortunately, only a low percentage (34%) of firms and managers assigned to the Web technology treatment both reported access to e-mail and were willing provide their e-mail addresses; they tended to be large firms and from the service sector. Moreover, those that did offer e-mail addresses were only about half as likely to respond to the Web-based survey as those targeted by other survey technologies. However, Web, fax and disk-by-mail technologies yielded higher item completion rates than mail. Limited statistical evidence indicated that respondents using computer-based survey technologies (i.e. Web or disk-by-mail) generally reported forecasting characteristics that are associated with firms exhibiting best practices. Thus, a multi-technology survey approach using the Web and fax can yield a strong combination of benefits over a traditional mail survey. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We find that different process environments tend to align advanced manufacturing technology investments in distinct profiles, which are associated with superior performance. Deviations from these 'ideal' profiles are shown to have a negative impact on manufacturing performance. The findings also suggest that firms are not fully exploiting the potential afforded by AMT investments to compete in off-diagonal positions in the Hayes-Wheelwright framework.

Given this issue, we attempted to test and extend one of the most influential OM configurations - Miller and Roth's [Management Science 40 (1994) 285] taxonomy of manufacturing strategies. Their taxonomy was longitudinally replicated with a newer set of North America Manufacturing Futures data as well as an entirely different global sample. Our replications partially supported Miller and Roth's taxonomy of three strategy-types (Caretakers, Marketeers, and Innovators), but found no evidence of the two underlying dimensions of manufacturing strategy that they called market scope and differentiation. Interestingly, the Marketeers were replaced in the 1990s by a new strategy called Designers, and three other unique manufacturing strategies were identified in the global data.

It is the objective of this paper to highlight the merits and pitfalls of the CC/BM scheduling approach. Following a short overview of the fundamentals of CC/BM, the strengths and weaknesses of the approach are put into perspective, based on a critical analysis of the literature as well as our own experimentation with commercial CC/BM software. The CC/BM scheduling mechanism is tested in a full factorial experiment performed on a set of benchmark problems. It appears that the 50% rule for buffer sizing may lead to a serious overestimation of the required buffer protection. Regularly updating the baseline schedule and the critical chain provides the best intermediate estimates of the final project duration and yields the smallest final project duration. Using clever project scheduling and rescheduling mechanisms such as branch-and-bound, has a beneficiary effect on the final makespan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

While prior studies have focused on the operational performance of various airlines and airports, few have assessed the efficacy of government airline safety programs. This empirical study evaluates a commercial aviation safety program that sanctions pilots with alcohol-related motor vehicle convictions. We compare a 5-year period prior to the implementation of the program against a 5-year period after implementation using data on over 160,000 commercial pilots. We conclude that the FAA's handling of pilots with motor vehicle convictions has had a negligible effect on airline safety. These results have operational as well as public policy implications.

Purchasing integration refers to the integration of strategic purchasing practices and goals with a firm's objectives. Alternative models linking purchasing integration to purchasing practices and manufacturing performance are hypothesized and tested using empirical data. Purchasing integration was found to moderate the relationship between purchasing practices and manufacturing performance. Increased investments in purchasing integration were observed to lead to higher performance returns from investments in purchasing practices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

The Baldrige model of quality management for the health care industry is tested here using data from 220 US hospitals. Results of confirmatory structural equation modeling show that many of the hypothesized causal relationships in the Baldrige model are statistically significant. For example, Leadership (Baldrige Category 1.0) is identified as a driver of all components in the Baldrige System, including Information and Analysis, Strategic Planning, Human Resource Development and Management, and Process Management. This study also clarifies and improves understanding of within-System performance relationships. Baldrige components of Leadership and Information and Analysis are significantly linked with Organizational Performance Results while Human Resource Development and Management and Process Management significantly link with Customer Satisfaction, In addition, a comprehensive "measurement model" grounded in the Baldrige Health Care Criteria for the 28 dimensions of measurement is developed, tested, and found to be valid and reliable. This valid and reliable measurement model allows a fair test of the "structural model", which tests the relationships among the Baldrige model constructs.

This paper reports on an empirical comparison of two configuration-based typologies: the Product-process matrix and the more recent generic manufacturing strategies model. Since there is substantial conceptual overlap between these models, a simultaneous examination provides insights about both models, and in particular, about the value-added of the generic manufacturing strategies model. We examine hypotheses derived from these typologies using data from manufacturing plants in the United States, Italy, United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany; and from the automotive, machinery, and electronics industries. The data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and hierarchical regression techniques. Our results indicate support for the Product-process matrix - lending further strength to a growing base of empirical research on this model. Our findings also provide support for the generic manufacturing strategies model with respect to various measures of cost, cycle time/inventory, quality, and innovation performance. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the generic manufacturing strategies model is a useful augmentation to the Product-process matrix. These findings suggest that the generic manufacturing strategy model has merit but deserves further empirical and theoretical attention. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We model and test their relationships to each other and to financial performance. We also examine two context variables as antecedent to knowledge: they are demand unpredictability (a dimension of environmental uncertainty) and mass output orientation (a measure of production technology type). The results show that knowledge completely mediates the effects of context on financial performance; i.e. the context variables impact knowledge and knowledge impacts financial performance, but the context variables have no direct effect on financial performance. Thus, knowledge appears to shield the firm from demand unpredictability, while mass output orientation type affects financial performance only through its impact on knowledge.

We maintain that purchasing is a strategic contributor to the firm, and that the selection and retention of external suppliers is a fundamental and strategic purchasing task that manifests the function's competitive priorities. Researchers and managers increasingly view the operations and purchasing functions as intimately linked, and as playing important roles in supply chain management. Ultimately, the performance of the operations management system, measured in terms of quality, cost, delivery and flexibility, depends on inputs secured by the purchasing function from the firm's suppliers. However, in a search for substantive relationships, the purchasing Literature has largely overlooked methodological issues such as measurement. Using empirical data collected from North American purchasing executives, a confirmatory factor analysis provides evidence that purchasing's competitive priorities may be conceptualized similarly to the competitive priorities in operations, with key differences. The measures satisfy key measurement criteria including unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and reliability. Five competitive priorities form the basis of a multidimensional measure of purchasing's competitive priorities, the individual factors of which will allow for the examination of linkages between purchasing, operations and other parts of the supply chain.

The characteristics examined are firm size, the degree of capital intensity, the degree of diversification, the timing of TQM implementation, and the maturity of the program. We find that smaller firms do significantly better than larger firms. Firms that have won awards from independent award (a proxy for more mature TQM implementation) do significantly better than just supplier award winners. The evidence weakly supports the hypotheses that less capital-intensive firms do better than more capital-intensive firms, and more focused firms do better than more diversified firms. Finally, we do not observe any significant differences between the performance of earlier and later implementers of effective TQM. The key implications of these results are that many organizational characteristics moderate the benefits of TQM implementation. Although not all of these characteristics are controllable by managers, managers must set realistic expectations for the degree of benefits from TQM. The results for size and capital-intensity validate the importance of TQM practices for smaller firms and environments that are more labor intensive. Investing to achieve a broader, deeper, and more mature TQM implementation (possibly by targeting an independent TQM award) should also result in higher benefits from TQM implementation. Furthermore, the results indicate that it is never too late to invest in TQM. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, purchasing-related factors influencing internal and external product and service quality were identified from the literature and an internal service quality model was developed and then tested using empirical data. Survey data were collected from 118 US purchasing executives in a wide range of industries. The findings from this study indicate the existence of strong positive relationships between implementation of cooperative purchasing/supplier relationships, internal service quality, and the service and product quality provided to external customers. Additionally, the key role of purchasing in the integration and communication of quality expectations and quality performance throughout the firm is demonstrated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Operations managers constantly struggle to seek answers to the right set of managerial actions that can be used to leverage technology for process effectiveness. This study takes a step in that direction by empirically examining the management of computer aided design (CAD) technology and outcomes of the product design process within manufacturing firms. In particular, the level of functionality and sophistication of the CAD system are examined with respect to the use of several structural and infrastructural management levers such as the degree of a firm's formalization and decentralization, the extent of the use of teams, the extent of training of CAD designers, and the equity of the incentives within the product design process. The influence of these management levers upon the CAD system performance is analyzed through the use of moderated regression analysis conducted on a cross-sectional data of 143 firms representing the vehicular industry in the USA. Our findings indicate that CAD functionality and sophistication are positively related to product design quality, flexibility, and overall performance. The impact of management levers on this relationship is a mixed one. Decentralization has no impact on the CAD technology-performance relationship, formalization has some positive effects, and the use of teams is helpful only in moderating the influence of sophistication on overall performance. Equity of incentives enhances design quality, while training is very important in improving performance across the board. In general, sophisticated "state of the art" CAD systems require much more proactive management than highly functional ones. Recommendations emerging from this study hopefully provide insights into a better management of not only CAD systems, but other process level technologies as well that are relevant to firms in the manufacturing sector. We also discuss implications of technology management provided by this research for creating leading edge enterprises. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We develop a theoretical framework and conduct a cross-sectional empirical study to investigate the inter-relationships among these constructs. The results indicate that higher levels of both employees' motivation/vision and organizational learning positively affect perceived service quality. Additionally, employees' motivation/vision was found to mediate the relationship between organizational learning and perceived service quality. These results highlight the importance of employees' motivation/vision in both the service process and the learning process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we take this observation to the next level by arguing the need to recognize supply networks as a complex adaptive system (CAS). We propose that many supply networks emerge rather than result from purposeful design by a singular entity. Most supply chain management literature emphasizes negative feedback for purposes of control, however, the emergent patterns in a supply network can much better be managed through positive feedback, which allows for autonomous action. Imposing too much control detracts from innovation and flexibility; conversely, allowing too much emergence can undermine managerial predictability and work routines. Therefore, when managing supply networks, managers must appropriately balance how much to control and how much to let emerge. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

(1991) [Journal of Operations Management 10 (2), 194-212)]. The results show some changes in the perceptions of journals over the past decade. Some journals are perceived to be extremely relevant to POM research, but not particularly of "high" quality. For other journals, the reverse is true - "high" quality is perceived but the published studies are not considered particularly relevant to POM. The Journal of Operations Management remained atop the relevance rankings and retained its position among the top three journals for quality. The study identifies factors that the respondents say influence their perception of journal quality. Finally, the paper finds some evidence that association with the editorial board of a journal affects one's perceptions of the quality and relevance of that journal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Postponement means delaying activities in the supply chain until customer orders are received with the intention of customizing products, as opposed to performing those activities in anticipation of future orders. This paper reviews the literature on postponement dating back to 1965, and puts it in a systematic framework. In light of the classification of the literature developed, opportunities are identified for integration and cross-fertilization between research papers in disciplines such as logistics and operations management and between the variety of research methods used. Some directions for research (in terms of content and methodology) are then formulated. For instance, the development of a more integrated supply chain perspective on postponement, and the application of triangulation rather than single methods. Specific research activities to meet these challenges are suggested in the paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Is it more important to link with suppliers, customers, or both? Similarly, we know little about the connections between supplier and customer integration and improved operations performance. This paper investigated supplier and customer integration strategies in a global sample of 322 manufacturers. Scales were developed for measuring supply chain integration and five different strategies were identified in the sample. Each of these strategies is characterized by a different "arc of integration", representing the direction (towards suppliers and/or customers) and degree of integration activity. There was consistent evidence that the widest degree of are of integration with both suppliers and customers had the strongest association with performance improvement. The implications for our findings on future research and practice in the new millennium are considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A critical part of mass customization is simultaneously achieving customer responsiveness, cost efficiency, and high volume production in the manufacturing system. This research describes mass customization and provides a framework to understand the relationships among time-based manufacturing practices, mass customization, and value to the customer. It involves the development of an instrument to measure mass customization. Data were collected from 303 manufacturing firms of various size, location, and industry to develop the instrument and test the relationships in the framework. The primary research method was structural equation modeling using LISREL. The study indicates that firms with high levels of time-based manufacturing practices have high levels of mass customization and value to the customer. Also, firms with high levels of mass customization have high levels of value to customer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Opportunities for timely introduction of valuable or even preemptive technologies can be missed because unit cost comparisons, typically applied to a limited set of vehicle configurations with volumes based on current demand figures, invariably favor incumbent over new technologies. In this research, we develop a more complete technology adoption decision model that integrates product mix and technology adoption decisions. Specifically, we recognize that product mix and volume are important variables in determining the cost effectiveness of new technologies, and include in the model customer demand projections that reflect market trends (e.g. growing demand for increasingly sophisticated features and functions in vehicles). Anticipated experience benefits are then applied to the appropriate production volumes to more accurately predict the profit impact of adopting new technologies. The introduction of automotive multiplexing. a technology that is characteristic of current technological advances in the industry, provides a context for considering insights that can be derived from the decision model. Our interaction with a global Tier I automotive systems supplier allowed us to obtain representative cost data and other information relevant to the technology adoption decision.

While the strategic implications of expanding services from a domestic market to an international location have been well documented, multicultural customer segments at one location is a unique problem that has largely been neglected by researchers. This paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting a conceptual framework and method for determining the extent of service product and process attribute standardization versus customization in these settings. The paper presents an approach for modeling the preferences of different cultural segments, evaluating the differences between the segments and determining the appropriate service strategy for service providers. We evaluate the effects of competitors adopting their revenue maximizing strategy both independently of each other and simultaneously while assuming the size of the market is viewed as a zero sum game. In an actual application at an international airport terminal, one food-service vendor implemented the suggested operations strategy and the result was a significant revenue gain over the previous year's sales during the same period. The method has valuable implications for managers when developing strategies for delivering a service to multicultural customer segments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Prior work in this area has tended to focus primarily on the involvement of the manufacturing executive in strategic decision making processes, while relatively little attention has been given to the level of influence enjoyed by the manufacturing executives. This study jointly examines the role of both influence and involvement in achieving better business performance, which we posit is expected to occur through alignment between the organizational and manufacturing strategies rather than directly. A research model based on procedural justice and strategic information management literature is proposed to represent this phenomenon. Structural equation modeling is used to empirically test the research model and its related hypothesis on the basis of data collected from 202 senior manufacturing executives representing mid to large sized firms from diverse industry groups across the US. In addition, interviews with a sub-sample of respondents are used to further explore the contextual nature of these relationships. The results indicate that involvement and influence are indeed two different, but highly related, aspects of the manufacturing executive s role. The interviews revealed numerous differences between the two with respect to achieving each and individual benefits derived from them. As expected, both involvement and influence are important determinants of strategy alignment with influence appearing to play a more substantive role. More importantly, it is this alignment that affects business performance. Implications of our findings for improving manufacturing practice, along with possible avenues for future research directions in this area, are also provided. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These techniques, however, can be matched by competitors if used without the guidance of a strategic framework. Similarly, structural capacity choices can be matched by competitors without the infrastructural benefits of a well defined operations strategy. In this study, multiattribute utility (MAU) theory analysis was used in an experiment to quantify the contribution of various structural and infrastructural strategic factors toward sustaining competitive advantage within the context of a capital equipment selection decision. The experimental respondents were manufacturing managers and professionals from the plastics industry. This research provides groundwork for understanding the role of strategic infrastructural factors in sustaining competitive advantage within the structural capacity decision of selecting capital equipment in the plastics industry.

We also find that the relationship between TPM and MP can be explained by both direct and indirect relationships. In particular, there is a significant and positive indirect relationship between TPM and MP through Just-In-Time (JIT) practices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, as noted by Ward et al. (1995), an understanding of the factors that influence operations strategy development has not been widely studied. Further, how managers of firms in underdeveloped countries develop operations strategy has yet to receive any significant attention among researchers. This paper takes a look at the development of operations strategy in an underdeveloped economy, Ghana. Specifically, the paper examines the relationships between the business environment and the operations strategy choices made by firms in Ghana. The paper seeks to understand the influence that specific business environmental factors have on the operations strategy choices of low cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery dependability. A survey of manufacturing firms was carried out in 1998. The respondents (production managers in those firms) were asked to indicate the extent to which business costs, labor availability, competitive hostility, and environmental dynamism were of concern to them. They were also asked to indicate their extent of emphasis on the operations strategy choices of quality, cost, flexibility and delivery dependability. This paper presents the result of the analysis of the relationships between the environmental factors and the operations strategy choices. The data indicate that, among firms in Ghana, the two strongest factors that influence the degree of emphasis placed on operations strategy choices are perceived business costs and competitive hostility. Results are presented for both large and small firms, and for firms that are completely locally owned as well as for joint venture firms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The US manufacturers have struggled with growing trade deficits and outsourced operations, while strong market competitors have emerged, using superior manufacturing practices in the form of just-in-time (JIT) and continuous process improvement. Although proponents cite the many benefits of JIT adoption, its implementation rate in the US has been relatively conservative. This study uses survey responses from executives at 95 JIT-practicing firms to better understand the benefits that firms have experienced through JIT adoption, and whether a more comprehensive implementation is worthwhile. The research results demonstrate that implementing the quality continuous improvement, and waste reduction practices embodied in the JIT philosophy can enhance firm competitiveness. JIT implementation improves performance through lower inventory levels, reduced quality costs, and greater customer responsiveness. This study indicates that JIT is a vital manufacturing strategy to build and sustain competitive advantage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Concurrent engineering (CE) is a mechanism that can reduce uncertainty and equivocality and improve an organization's competitive capabilities. CE is typically manifested through concurrent work-flows, product development teams, and early involvement of constituents. It enables information to flow through the organization quickly and effectively thereby, reducing uncertainty. At the same time, it enables debate, clarification, and enactment which are essential elements in combating equivocality. CE practices are also purported to have significant effects on product innovation, quality and premium price capabilities. This research carefully defines CE and creates a valid and reliable instrument to assess it. It reports on the development and testing of a model that relates CE to some of its most salient consequences. Half of the sample of 244 firms is used for exploratory purposes and half for confirmatory work and hypotheses testing. Results indicate that firms that experience a high technological and product change in their environment are using more CE practices. In addition, results suggest that CE practices have significant direct effects on product innovation. However, only the indirect effects of CE on quality and premium pricing are statistically significant. Firms with higher levels of product innovation have higher levels of quality. Firms with higher levels of product innovation do exhibit premium pricing capabilities but only if they affect quality capabilities. Finns that display elevated quality levels excel in their premium pricing capabilities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis and design procedures make use of the concepts of Wickham Skinner and Marshall Fisher to answer the strategic questions "what facilities are required and how should they be laid out to enable the necessary focused demand chains?" and to answer the tactical question "which focused demand chain is appropriate for this product?" The case study then details how the company has been transformed from operating within a traditional supply chain to driving change via the engineering of four focused demand chains. The paper concludes with a comparison of operations enablers, customer choice, and business performance metrics covering the transition period culminating in the current focused demand chain scenario. By matching products to the appropriate value stream there is a consequential reduction in product development time of 75%; manufacturing costs reduction of up to 27%; and up to 95% reduction in delivery lead times.

In addition, there is generally a lack of empirical testing and validation of manufacturing strategies. Coupled to this fact is that empirical work is rarely carried out in an inter-disciplinary manner, with the complete combination of OM, marketing, strategy, lean thinking and accounting approaches particularly poorly researched. Fully cross-functional integrative empirical research is required to help support the understanding of the applicability of OM practices within industry. This paper explores such an integration of approaches developed within the 'lean thinking, strategic cost management, marketing and policy deployment areas'. In order to investigate the approach a single automotive retailer is used as an instrumental case. The results of the study show that the new approach stands up well as an integrative approach that can prove highly beneficial results. However, the pilot work also identified a number of limitations that are the basis of further refinement and testing of the method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This inductive case study of six customer cases of Nokia Networks, one of the leading providers of mobile telecommunication technology, led to propositions exploring that question. Good relationship between the customer and the supplier contributes to reliable information flows, and reliable demand information flows in turn contribute to high efficiency-these are well-researched issues also in other industry environments. But in a fast-growing systems business such as mobile telecommunications industry, the supplier needs to be able to adapt its offering to a wide variety of customer situations and needs. Understanding the customer's situation and need together with the right offering contributes to good co-operation in improving the joint demand chain, which further leads to superior demand chain efficiency and high customer satisfaction.

The concepts of supply chain management (SCM), and its extension demand chain management (I)CM), have been at the center of much recent research. One of the reasons for this is that, over the last years, a significant number of information systems have emerged, which claim to support the concept. The paper argues that these systems mostly adopt a myopic view of planning, based on pure deterministic planning methods. It demonstrates that such an approach fails to coop with the considerable uncertainty of the planning information. The proposed robust planning paradigm is then introduced and its impact explained, using the well-known example of the beer game. It holds the promise of reducing the number of re-plarming cycles, through a better characterization of the expected service level performance over a medium planning horizon. Finally, a case study will show the value of robust planning in a European chemical enterprise. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been argued in the manufacturing literature that manufacturing facilities, technology and policies are important to gain performance. However, little has been done to examine the capabilities from a resource based perspective. Nor has there been an exploration in how firms develop and leverage new capabilities. The literature also tends to neglect how complex and often intertwined these capabilities are within the firms. This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the successful development of new resources and competencies that were created when Analog Devices developed an emerging technology. The paper is exploratory and identifies the new competencies and Analog Devices' ability to capitalize upon them. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

As success in the business world depends on the ability to do more with less, it is important for these high technology firms to understand why certain projects consume less monetary resources but still achieve superior product development outcomes. To address this question, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding the interdependencies between projects and their relationship to project performance in a multiple-concurrent R&D environment. The framework is developed through multiple-case studies of projects undertaken by a Fortune 500 high technology manufacturing firm. The seven projects that comprised the sample for the multiple-case study were chosen from a larger portfolio of projects belonging to a technology group at the firm's corporate R&D center. The choice of the seven projects was guided by a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based project performance metric, also proposed in this paper. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These supply networks pertain to the center console assembly and come from three different product lines-Honda Accord, Acura CL/TL, and DaimlerChrysler (DCX) Grand Cherokee. Based on these three cases of supply networks, propositions are built concerning how the structure of supply networks operates. Based on the extant literature, we frame structure in three dimensions-formalization, centralization, and complexity. As an underlying methodology, we first conduct the within-case analysis and then expand the analysis to cross-case context. The three structural dimensions affect one another progressively, and the cost consideration appears to be the overarching force that shapes the supply-network structure.

Manufacturing's response to business success in small and medium enterprises	WOS:000177565000006	manufacturing strategy; flexibility; SMEs; gusher; New Zealand	ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGY; CONFIGURATIONS; FLEXIBILITY	5	This study examined how the operations in six New Zealand manufacturers responded to the turbulence in their business environment brought on by the success of their products. It was carried out in response to various calls in the business and operations strategies literature for more studies on how companies create configurations of capabilities that lead to competitive advantage, how these literature can be better integrated, and on internal fit within manufacturing. Case research and historiographic methods were used to record the competitive evolution of these firms. The study used semi-structured interviews with Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and operations managers, analysis of company and public records and a manufacturing practices survey instrument. We suggest that when small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with sudden and dramatic success from an innovation, they need to focus the company's energy and resources on that product and its niche. Then, in terms of manufacturing strategy, the key attribute to develop is an operation that can produce short runs at little or no cost penalty, achieve requisite product variety, provide short manufacturing throughput times, and operate at high levels of quality and delivery dependability. We find that an approach that develops manufacturing capabilities that are related to market requirements is preferred to panacea-based approaches. Also, we see no common pattern in manufacturing capability development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We find that in all three firms, there is significant concern among managers for gaining competitiveness through volume flexibility. We also find that there are several avenues for developing a volume flexible response and that deployment of these tactics is dependent on the availability of resources and systems. To verify some of these propositions we report on the outcomes of a field survey that measures the importance firms place on volume flexibility as well as the corresponding actions they take to remain volume flexible. Our critical finding is that short- and long-term sources of volume flexibility have a positive, albeit differential, impact on a firm's performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, modularity is not a dichotomous property of a product, as different types of modularity can be embedded into a product family architecture. The present paper explores how manufacturing characteristics affect the appropriate type of modularity to be embedded into the product family architecture, and how the types of modularity relate to component sourcing. The study is based on a qualitative research design involving a multiple case study methodology to examine six product families belonging to six European companies. The themes derived through case analyses are synthesized in the form of empirical generalizations. Insights from these empirical generalizations are subsequently developed into two propositions explaining why and under what conditions these empirical generalizations might hold for a product family outside of the original sample. The theoretical results formalize, first of all, a type of modularity (i.e. combinatorial modularity) not currently described in literature. Second, the theoretical propositions suggest that when the desired level of product variety is low (high) relative to total production volume, component swapping modularity (combinatorial modularity) helps to maximize operational performance. Finally, the complexity of component families outsourced to suppliers and the geographical proximity of component family suppliers affect the extent to which the product variety-operational performance trade-off can be mitigated through modularity.

However, while batching is also employed in mass services, it is not clear to what extent the manufacturing theory may be transferred. A single case study of a court scheduling service system with imbedded instances of batching was studied to address this question. The findings and analysis of the case indicate that while the factors that affect batching in manufacturing still apply, so do additional factors. The net effect is a broader set of considerations which influence the determination of when batching is desired in mass services and how big batches should be. Definitions of these factors, their relationships with batch size, and testable hypotheses are offered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Researchers have responded with a great deal of theoretical and empirical work aimed at identifying factors that influence the performance of these teams. Scholars, however, have tended to focus their research on variables human resource managers can readily control (e.g. the composition of teams relative to members' characteristics, team goals) and little emphasis has been placed on factors inherent to production systems. Identifying factors in the production system that influence team effectiveness is crucial because many of these factors are not changeable in the short term. Accordingly, these production system factors are likely to be a crucial factor when deciding whether or not to organize a production system around teams. In a departure from past research, this article reports a qualitative study aimed at identifying factors in operational systems that influence team effectiveness. Our qualitative results suggest that four characteristics of the operational system influence team effectiveness: work organized around the team's output, opportunities for informal communication, work that includes novel problems to solve, and management trust in teams.

Following Meredith's [J. Operat. Manage. 16 (1998) 441] suggestion to use case studies as a basis for theory formulation, insights from the cases were used to extend existing theory by generating hypotheses pertaining to the timing and sustainability of performance gains following the implementation of performance improvement teams, focusing, in particular on ongoing performance improvement teams. Because of the richness of the case study data, we delve deeper than other studies into the actions of teams and management to better understand how and why successful performance improvement teams evolve as they do. Stated in temporal order, our main hypotheses are: work team engagement is positively associated with early implementation credibility-building activities; both outcome-orientation and substantive participation are positively associated with a rapid rate of performance gains; and team institutionalization is positively associated with sustaining performance gains. The findings of the case studies and the associated hypotheses are summarized in a time-phased framework for work team implementation. Limitations and directions for further research are discussed.

In this high-change and complex environment, firms face high levels of uncertainty and equivocality, and in response, they seek integrative structural mechanisms. In these organizations, product development is characterized by the use of heavyweight product development managers, concurrent engineering, and computer usage. These mechanisms give product development efforts the senior leadership to overcome resistance, the ability to integrate and coordinate activities, the access to relevant information, and the ability to process it effectively. This research describes a framework for product development practices, and it discusses relations among these variables as well as important performance variables (product innovation, quality, premium pricing, and profitability). Based on responses from 244 manufacturing firms, the study suggests that heavyweight product development managers drive the application of concurrent engineering and computer use. Computer use has a significant and positive impact on product innovation, and concurrent engineering has a positive effect on quality. Product innovation also seems to have an influence on quality. Both quality and product innovation have a significant and positive impact on premium pricing, which, in turn, influences profitability. The extent to which a firm uses a product platform strategy seems to be an important contextual variable that affects the nature of the relationships among product development practices and competitive capabilities. Firms operating in uncertain or equivocal environments appear to adopt higher levels of integrated product development practices than firms operating in low uncertainty or low equivocality environments.

We present the results of a controlled experiment within a larger data collection effort. The same survey instrument was completed by 416 Internet customers of a major office supplies company, with approximately 60% receiving the survey in paper form and 40% receiving the electronic version. In order to evaluate the efficacy of electronic surveys relative to traditional, printed surveys we conduct two levels of analysis. On a macro-level, we compare the two groups for similarity in terms of fairly aggregate, coarse data characteristics such as response rates, proportion of missing data, scale means and inter-item reliability. On a more fine-grained, micro-level, we compare the two groups for aspects of data integrity such as the presence of data runs and measurement errors. This deeper, finer-grained analysis allows an examination of the potential benefits and flaws of electronic data collection. Our findings suggest that electronic surveys are generally comparable to print surveys in most respects, but that there axe a few key advantages and challenges that researchers should evaluate. Notably, our sample indicates that electronic surveys have fewer missing responses and can be coded/presented in a more flexible manner (namely, contingent coding with different respondents receiving different questions depending on the response to earlier questions) that offers researchers new capabilities.

It is characterized by interorganizational coordination: companies working jointly with their customers and suppliers to integrate activities along the supply chain to effectively supply product to customers. More developed SCM is indicated by systematic integration, i.e. standardized and automatic interorganizational interfaces. Information technology (IT) engenders such systematic integration by allowing more efficient and automatic information now. This research focuses on electronic data interchange (EDI), an important class of IT used for interorganizational information transfers in the supply chain. Data from a survey of the food industry is used to examine the use of EDI with respect to interfirm coordination activities involving suppliers and customers. The influence of demographic characteristics on EDI use is also investigated. The results suggest that firms view EDI as a toot for improving efficiencies rather than as a tool for facilitating supply chain integration. There is also a surprising difference in firms use of EDI with customers vis-h-vis suppliers. Firms tend to be much more accommodating of the desires of their customers than of their suppliers.

In this challenging time, our study presents hospital administrators with some valuable information that can help improve community hospitals' performance. The purpose of this paper is to develop a strategic operations management model that links long-term service choices, intermediate operations decisions, and hospital performance given the structural constraints of location, size, and medical teaching status. Data collected from 151 community hospitals are used to test the model. The research identifies strategic operations management decisions in the US community hospitals, shows their causal relationships, and identifies their effects on hospital performance. Specifically, we find that intermediate infrastructural operations decisions affect a community hospital's cost, quality, and financial performance after the structural decisions of location and size have set the stage. Our study also reveals that community hospitals have adopted new staff and demand management decisions in response to the market needs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The process of managing the strategic alignment between a firm's business strategy, external environment, and the integration of manufacturing and marketing/sales decisions is very complex phenomenon that requires a level of analysis that has not occurred previously. This study examined the moderating effects of business strategy and demand uncertainty on the relationship between the integration of manufacturing and marketing/sales-based decisions and organizational performance. The study found general support for the proposed model, suggesting that the impact of the integration of manufacturing and marketing/sales decision on organizational performance is moderated by a firm's business strategy and demand uncertainty.

Drawing on the literature and prior empirical work in M/M strategies, we propose a path model for assessing the mediating impact of the M/M interface harmony-the functions' ability to work together-on M/M morale and business performance. Using two convenience samples of executives, we empirically test the direct and indirect influence of predisposing factors (antecedents) and performance outcomes (consequences) that are expected theoretically to influence or be influenced by M/M interface harmony. We find that 11 of the 13 hypothesized direct effects are significant at the 0.012 level or below; and attesting to the mediating influence of the M/M ability to work together, 11 of the 12 indirect effects were significant at the 0.02 level or below. Increasing the emphasis on the importance of marketing or manufacturing, or both, improves the ability of both functions to work harmoniously, which in turn impacts M/M morale. Interfunctional harmony appears to have a stronger influence on each function's morale than the importance attached to that function, ceteris paribus. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study provides insight on the distinctive roles whereby marketing and manufacturing functions influence performance. Marketing acts to improve competitive position and profitability through the mediating influence of M/M interface harmony and improved marketing morale. However, manufacturing morale was not shown to be a significant factor impacting performance. Rather, emphasis on manufacturing impacts competitive position directly, as indicated by the resource-based view of manufacturing strategy. This exploratory study provides new empirical evidence that the M/M interface harmony, as expressed by the functions' ability to work together, matters significantly to business outcomes directly and indirectly.

Four constructs are examined: (1) marketing's knowledge of manufacturing; (2) manufacturing's evaluation of marketing communication; (3) marketing-manufacturing integration; and (4) marketing-manufacturing relationship quality. Knowledge and communication are represented as antecedents of relationship quality and integration in a structural equations model (SEM). All relationships are posited to be positive, and we test whether they are moderated by (1) high versus low environmental uncertainty, and by (2) a high versus low rate of new product introduction as compared to competitors. In all cases but low uncertainty, the majority of structural paths are positive. Nevertheless, a strong, positive link exists between knowledge and integration in the low uncertainty case. Overall, we find that the more marketing knows about manufacturing and the more marketing is able to communicate credibly with manufacturing, better relationships and functional relationships will result with a variety of contingencies notwithstanding.

We first consider technological incompatibility between pairs of alternatives for different components to identify feasible product designs at various stages of product-development, from screening to the final design. We then consider experts' judgment on compatibility between pairs of alternatives for different attributes to generate product ideas and to perform a preliminary screening. This expert-based approach can be used in conjunction with other expert-based approaches or consumer-based approaches to identify potentially desirable product ideas. The methodology developed here includes explicit simultaneous consideration of product, process, and supply chain development and it is applicable to the entire spectrum of product novelty, from radical to incremental innovation.

Consequently, supply chain integration (SCI) strategies should be evaluated in the light of a company's market and product strategies. This paper examines the effect of SCI on the relationship between diversification and a firm's competitive performance. The results of the study can be useful in integrating supply chain strategy into market and product diversification (PD) strategy. By comparing the main and interaction effects of SCI and diversification on performance, the paper shows that SCI strategy modifies the relationship between diversification and performance. Additionally, it is argued that coordinated use of SCI and diversification strategies has a significant effect on firm performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

But while the term is used frequently in the service design and new service development literature, surprisingly little has been written about the service concept itself and its important role in service design and development.

We define the service concept and describe how it can be used to enhance a variety of service design processes. As illustrations here, we apply the service concept to service design planning and service recovery design processes. Employing the service concept as an important driver of service design decisions raises a number of interesting questions for research which are discussed here.

However, NSD remains among the least studied and understood topics in the service management literature, As a result, our current understanding of the critical resources and activities to develop new services is inadequate given NSD's importance as a service competitiveness driver. Until recently, the generally accepted principle behind NSD was that "new services happen" rather than occurring through formal development processes. Recent efforts to address this debate have been inconclusive. Thus, additional research is needed to validate or discredit the belief that new services happen as a result of intuition, flair, and luck. Relying upon the general distinctions between research exploitation and exploration, this paper describes areas in NSD research that deserve further leveraging and refinement (i.e. exploitation) and identifies areas requiring discovery or new study (i.e. exploration). We discuss the critical substantive and research design issues facing NSD scholars such as defining new services, choice in focusing on the NSD process or performance (or both), and specification of unit of analysis. We also examine what can be exploited from the study of new product development to further understanding of NSD. Finally, we explore one important area for future NSD research exploration: the impact of the Internet on the design and development of services. We offer research opportunities and research challenges in the study of NSD throughout the paper. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

110	Krajewski L	2002	J OPER MANAG	20	2		Journal	Editorial Material	3	Reflections on operations management research	WOS:000174845000002			1	It has been more than 18 years since I stepped down as the founding editor of the Journal of Operations Management (JOM). I recall the feeling-bittersweet, but mostly sweet. Now we commemorate Jack Meredith's "retirement" as the editor of JOM. Jack has done a great service to the profession while editor of JOM. I am sure that he has similar feelings of reluctance to turn over the reins and let the parade pass, however, I am also sure that he joins me in expressing confidence that Rob Handfield will do an outstanding job as the new editor. The first issue of JOM came out in August 1980. As expressed in my inaugural editorial, the Journal was to satisfy three basic needs: (1) enhancement of interdisciplinary research, (2) encouragement of research into real problems faced by operations managers, and (3) put the word management back into operations management. What prompted the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to sponsor a journal devoted to addressing those three needs? The answer requires a brief review of history. What follows is my interpretation of various events in our past that, no doubt, are jaded by own experiences and opinions.

We employ recent extensions of data envelopment analysis while addressing difficulties often associated with empirical data in real life settings. The study measures DC productivity in a large scale setting, evaluates and identifies DCs with consistent best performance using facet analysis, and detects performance trends using window analysis of 4 years' data. This extensive evaluation of the empirical production frontier and of "role model" DCs provided very interesting insights for strategically managing operations. Our approach opens up possible new directions for examining supply chain DCs or other activities where explicit knowledge about the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not well known.

An analysis was done of 233 OM survey research papers published over the past 12 years which showed that the average managerial response rate flattened-out in the mid-1990s at, approximately 32% and has not improved since then. This paper goes on to examine the theories and techniques found in the diverse survey research literature on improving response rates including OM survey research benchmarks that achieved very high response rates. By following the tactics outlined in this paper, OM survey researchers stand an excellent chance of not only improving the overall respondent yields for their studies but also reducing the bias caused by non-response.

Using data from a primary survey of hospitals and from various secondary sources, we investigate the incremental effects on hospital performance of location, strategy, and technology. We find that hospital location is significantly related to performance, but that a hospital's choice of strategy can moderate the effect of location. Additionally, we find hospitals that invest more extensively in clinical technologies tend to be better performers regardless of location. Hospital size, measured as number of beds, captures the effects of location and technology investment in accounting for a major portion of hospital performance. While we cannot argue that larger is always better for hospitals, mergers, partnerships, and other forms of consolidation currently observed in the marketplace indicate that managers in the hospital industry understand the advantage of size.

This paper presents findings from an exploratory study that analyzes the impact of purchasing'S Strategic role, industry context and purchasing organizational structure, on the use of various forms of purchasing teams. Using survey data from a broad sample of industries, we found that team usage was a two-dimensional construct: internal teams and councils, and customer teams. In addition, purchasing's strategic role comprised two factors: product and technology planning, and external systems planning. After controlling for firm size, purchasing's strategic role was positively related to the greater use of internal teams and councils, but not customer teams. Industry context also played a role in the usage of teams, with internal teams and councils more extensively used by the firms that manufactured discrete goods. Meanwhile, firms in the service sector favored the use of customer teams. Finally, both industry context and purchasing's organizational structure were related to the strategic role assumed by purchasing, with a decentralized structure tending to reduce that strategic role.

After the initial hype and enthusiasm, it is time to take stock of the knowledge accumulated in what is now a mature field of study and look for directions to take the field further forward. This article reflects on the mass of literature in the field, synthesizing, organizing and structuring knowledge and offering suggestions for future research. It reviews QM research organized along five main themes: the definition of QM, the definition of product quality, the impact of QM on firm performance, QM in the context of management theory and the implementation of QM. The article draws on these themes to reflect on three questions which are fundamental to re-visit and re-appraise QM: (i) What is QM? (ii) Is the set of practices associated with QM valid as a whole? (iii) How to implement QM in a real business setting? (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The results are based on a sample of 519 glitches announcements made during 1989-2000. Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market-wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market's reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market's reaction to pre- 1995 and post- 1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt-equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market's reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two major components of an integrated supply chain strategy are identified and defined: (1) integrative information technologies, which is modeled antecedent to (2) supply chain integration. The research model was tested using data from a sample (n = 57) of the top 150 independent first tier automotive suppliers to the Big 3 in North America. The results showed positive direct relationships between (1) integrated information technologies and supply chain integration, (2) supply chain integration and customer service, and (3) customer service and firm performance. The relationship of supply chain integration to financial performance was indirect, through customer service; i.e., customer service was found to fully (as opposed to partially) mediate the relationship between supply chain integration and firm performance for first tier suppliers in the automotive industry.

A model of learning in supply management processes is examined using samples representing three nodes of one Fortune 500 organization's supply chains (internal SBU customers, n = 14 1; corporate buyers, n = 115, and external suppliers, n = 5 8). Organizational learning is viewed as a composite construct arising from four tangible indicators: team-, systems-, learning-, and memory-orientations (each of those orientations is measured with four to five items). The results indicate that learning has a positive effect on a set of learning consequences, supply management consequences, management consequences, and performance consequences.

Moreover, unlike past studies, no front-office process has a corresponding back-office process in our sample. The analysis of unrelated front-office and back-office processes offers a more rigorous examination of the customer contact model. The findings by and large support the premise of this model for breaking up the activities involved in a service delivery process. Our most surprising finding relates to the levers for achieving outstanding performance. The best performers among the processes with a front-office orientation emphasize capital investment, while the best performers among those with a back-office orientation embrace higher degrees of labor intensity. It appears that in order to achieve its superior performance, each process type adopts an additional design characteristic commonly attributed to the opposite process type. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

[J. Operations Manage. 14 (4) (1996) 297-313] and Jonsson [Int. J. Operations Production Manage. 20 (12) (2000) 1446-1474]. A survey of the 20 plants in the population was conducted via postal questionnaire between July 1999 and April 2001, with a structured interview being held at a later date. A cluster analysis was performed which allowed a taxonomy with three groups of plants to be established: traditionalists, designers and investors. These three groups differ from each other with regard to their AMT investments, industrial activity, size and degree of integration. Differences between the groups in company performance cannot be appreciated. Although the results apparently seem to back up most of the findings of previous works biased to larger companies, they do bring certain aspects into question regarding the explanation for the way the groups are formed. The three critical factors which determine AMT investment in the sector are the company's being of a certain minimum size, undergoing a period of expansion, and type of activity.

Managers act rationally in implementing JIT if they are convinced that JIT enhances firm performance. From both a cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective, this survey study of 253 US manufacturing firms finds significant statistical relationships between measures of profitability and the degree of specific JIT practices used. The evidence provides empirical support to the premise that firms that implement and maintain JIT manufacturing systems will reap sustainable rewards as measured by improved financial performance.

These studies have produced mixed results, probably because of the nature of the research designs used such as measuring TQM or performance as a single construct. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this study identifies the relationships among TQM practices and examines the direct and indirect effects of these practices on various performance levels. A proposed research model and hypotheses are tested by using cross-sectional mail survey data collected from firms operating in the US. The test of the structural model supports the proposed hypotheses. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed and further research directions are offered.

Operations Manage. 19 (2) (2001) 185] that characterizes the influence of supply chain integration on performance. Introducing supply chain integration intensity as a proxy variable for Frohlich and Westbrook's [J. Operations Manage. 19 (2) (2001) 185] 'outward-facing supply chain strategy'. we investigate the ways that manufacturing-based competitive capabilities mediate the relationship between supply chain integration and business performance. While previous research suggests that supply chain integration is directly related to superior business performance, the mediating role of manufacturing capabilities has not been explored. Using hierarchical regression analysis, we develop and test a theory-based model using a sample of consumer products manufacturers. Contrary to Frohlich and Westbrook's [J. Operations Manage. 19 (2) (2001) 185] assertions regarding the applicability of the outward-facing strategy' to the consumer goods sector, our results provide empirical evidence that supply chain integration intensity leads directly to improved business performance, thus corroborating the conventional wisdom concerning the increasing importance of supply chain integration in the consumer products sector. In addition, this study uncovers empirical evidence for the mediating role of manufacturing-based competitive capabilities in supply chain management. These results support the growing call for a broader, more generalized view of manufacturing strategy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, the rich theoretical base of TCT has seen limited application in the operations and supply chain management research. This article seeks to change that by providing a cogent synthesis of TCT, its assumptions, constructs, and propositions. It also summarizes existing empirical work in management and other disciplines that draws from the TCT perspective and examines relationships in manufacturing organizations. A measurement model of transaction costs is subsequently presented using data from 203 manufacturing firms in the OEM electronics industry. Guidelines and recommendations for researchers are then presented regarding both the uses of the theory and its measurement. It is hoped that this study will stimulate work in the important areas of inter-firm relationships that draw from this rich but underutilized theoretical lens, and thereby add another perspective to the knowledge base in related areas of the operations and supply chain management fields.

Journal of Operations Management (JOM), Management Science (MS), and Production and Operations Management (POM). In this paper, we reflect upon the state and evolution of survey research in the OM discipline across a 21-year time span and the contribution of OM journals that have published these studies. Major changes have occurred in the last 5 years of our sampling period, and two topics stood out as showing fastest ascendancy to prominence-operations strategy and supply chain management. Furthermore, over the years, the Journal of Operations Management appears to have been publishing more survey research articles and a greater variety of OM topics compared to the other five journals in our study.

The paper takes a contingency approach to explore the factors that impact production planning and control for closed-loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery. A series of three cases are presented, and a framework developed that. shows the common activities required for all remanufacturing operations. To build on the similarities and illustrate and integrate the differences in closed-loop supply chains, Hayes and Wheelwright's product-process matrix is used as a foundation to examine the three cases representing Remanufacture-to-Stock (RMTS), Reassemble-to-Order (RATO), and Remanufacture-to-Order (RMTO). These three cases offer end-points and an intermediate point for closed-loop supply operations. Since they represent different positions on the matrix, characteristics such as returns volume, timing, quality, product complexity, test and evaluation complexity, and remanufacturing complexity are explored. With a contingency theory for closed-loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery in place, past cases can now be reexamined and the potential for generalizability of the approach to similar types of other problems and applications can be assessed and determined.

As firms attempt to cope with an external environment that is changing from industrial to post-industrial, how do they implement change? This study develops a research framework that examines relationships among various structural dimensions (i.e. number of layers in the hierarchy, level of horizontal integration, locus of decision-making, nature of formalization, and level of communication), time-based manufacturing practices, and plant performance. Based on 224 responses from manufacturing firms, this study develops instruments to measure these organizational sub-dimensions using part of this sample (N = 104), and it tests the structural relationships with the remaining responses (N = 120). Results indicate that the nature of formalization, the number of layers in the hierarchy, and the level of horizontal integration have significant, direct, and positive effects on the locus of decision-making and level of communication. Locus of decision-making and the level of communication, in turn, have significant, direct, and positive effects on time-based manufacturing practices. Finally, time-based manufacturing practices have a significant, direct, and positive impact on plant performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Prior research has focused on the need for such activities, while current research tries to identify those components that encourage or discourage such activities. As a result of the introduction of ISO 14001, attention has turned to corporate environmental management systems (EMS). The underlying assumption is that such a system is critical to a firm's ability to reduce waste and pollution while simultaneously improving overall performance. This study evaluates this assumption. Drawing on data provided by a survey of North American managers, their attitudes toward EMS and ISO 14001, this study assesses the relative effects of having a formal but uncertified EMS compared to having a formal, certified system. The results strongly demonstrate that firms in possession of a formal EMS perceive impacts well beyond pollution abatement and see a critical positive impact on many dimensions of operations performance. The results also show that firms having gone through EMS certification experience a greater impact on performance than do firms that have not certified their EMS. Additionally, experience with these systems over time has a greater impact on the selection and use of environmental options. These results demonstrate the need for further investigation into EMS, the environmental options a firm chooses, and the direct and indirect relationships between these systems and performance.

Alignment of priorities is presumed to contribute to enhanced organizational performance, just as misalignment is expected to undermine performance. This study further develops and tests these theoretical conventions by examining the perceptions of general managers and manufacturing managers regarding manufacturing priorities of their business units. Based on a sample of matched pairs of manufacturing managers and general managers from 98 manufacturing plants, the hypotheses regarding the alignment-performance relationship are tested. Specifically, we tested whether the performance of the manufacturing unit is enhanced when general managers and manufacturing managers agree on strategic priorities. Furthermore, the influence of organizational factors on the relationship between alignment and performance of the manufacturing unit is studied. Results support our hypotheses that certain organizational variables moderate the relationship between alignment of priorities and manufacturing performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982]. This paper examines the effects of three contextual factors, plant size, plant age and unionization status, on the likelihood of implementing 22 manufacturing practices that are key facets of lean production systems. Further, we postulate four "bundles" of inter-related and internally consistent practices; these are just-in-time (JIT), total quality management (TQM), total preventive maintenance (TPM), and human resource management (HRM). We empirically validate our bundles and investigate their effects on operational performance. The study sample uses data from IndustryWeek's Census of Manufacturers. The evidence provides strong support for the influence of plant size on lean implementation, whereas the influence of unionization and plant age is less pervasive than conventional wisdom suggests. The results also indicate that lean bundles contribute substantially to the operating performance of plants, and explain about 23% of the variation in operational performance after accounting for the effects of industry and contextual factors.

The case of the Italian eyewear district	WOS:000180980500002	operation strategy; supplier management; international issue; case study research	INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS; STRATEGIES; NETWORKS; FLEXIBILITY; INTEGRATION; TAXONOMY; MODEL	2	In the era of global economy, are local manufacturing systems still playing a role or are they destined to fade away? No unequivocal answer to this question can be found in the literature. Some think that globalization exposes all the limits of local industrial systems. Others consider the contraposition between global and local to be only apparent. There could be, however, a clear relation between the firm's competitiveness on the international market and its territorial roots. The present paper focuses on one of the most important local systems in Italy, i.e. the eyewear district. Based on empirical research, the study analyzes the evolution of the eyewear industry, the strategies used by the larger producers to face the current competitive challenges and the consequences of such actions on the local supply system. It is shown that the district has lost most of its traditional features and inter-organizational relations have significantly changed. Opportunities arising from new technologies and global economy seem to favor better equipped, large-sized enterprises rather than small suppliers, or in any case, single units or groups rather than the system. Finally, some suggestions are provided for entrepreneurs or managers operating in industrial districts, concerning vertical integration and sourcing choices (main-contracting firms), and technological and managerial levers that could better qualify the supply offer (sub-contracting firms).

To respond, manufacturers are seeking to enhance flexibility across the value chain. Manufacturing flexibility, a critical dimension of value chain flexibility, is the ability to produce a variety of products in the quantities that customers demand while maintaining high performance. It is strategically important for enhancing competitive position and winning customer orders. This research organizes literature on manufacturing flexibility and classifies it according to competence and capability theory. It describes a framework to explore the relationships among flexible competence (machine, labor, material handling, and routing flexibilities), flexible capability (volume flexibility and mix flexibility), and customer satisfaction. It develops valid and reliable instruments to measure the sub-dimensions of manufacturing flexibility, and it applies structural equation modeling to a large-scale sample (n = 273). The results indicate strong, positive, and direct relationships between flexible manufacturing competence aid volume flexibility and between flexible manufacturing competence and mix flexibility. Volume flexibility and mix flexibility have strong, positive, and direct relationships with customer satisfaction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Rigorous academic research of Six Sigma requires the formulation and identification of useful theories related to the phenomenon. Accordingly, this paper develops an understanding of the Six Sigma phenomena from a goal theoretic perspective. After reviewing the goal theory literature, these concepts, when applied to Six Sigma, suggest some propositions for future research. This paper can help serve as a foundation for developing scientific knowledge about Six Sigma. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper develops a provisional model of operational risk based upon the input and outcome dimensions of causal event and negative consequence. Discussion of risk control constitutes a complementary theoretical dimension. Empirical evidence from four operational failure case studies offers an opportunity to revise and extend the initial model. Specific conclusions address the structural and temporal pathology of operational failure and the subjective 'layers' of internal and external loss that appear to influence overall negative consequences. Additionally, effective risk control is highlighted as an integrated process with more similarities to service quality management than variation-reduction process control. The paper concludes with reflection upon the limitations of the study and, given the preliminary nature of the work, some suggestions for future work. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While there have been numerous success stories, the amount of reported failures has been extremely high. In spite of all the recent failures, a select few organizations have been able to use e-commerce as a means to increase the overall profitability of their firm. An often-overlooked factor in website effectiveness and development is the effect of individual user differences on the acceptance of the new technology. This exploratory study examines how individual user views and preferences affect the use of the Internet as a purchasing medium. This research presents an exploratory study of data gathered through a survey of 416 customers of a major Internet retailer of commodity office supplies. Cluster analysis is employed to develop a model that classifies users of Internet purchasing into six distinct groups. The clusters are developed using a variety of items that measure end users' viewpoints and preferences regarding the Internet as a purchasing medium. These factors are based on the widely supported Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The classification system is then used to demonstrate how these groups vary on strategic items, cost issues and individual productivity measures. The findings provide important insights to companies seeking to capitalize on the Internet as a retailing channel by identifying factors that may lead to a loyal customer base rather than an opportunistic one that switches sites frequently solely to obtain lower prices.

This is in contrast with the manufacturing strategy contingency approach of operations management (OM) which advocates internal and external consistency between manufacturing strategy choices. This article investigates, using the case-study method, whether customer focus practices-a distinctive subset of the whole set of QM practices-are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy context. The study strongly suggests that customer focus practices are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy and identifies mechanisms by which this takes place. The findings inform the implementation of QM programs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, very little attention has been paid to address the impact of HRM practices on operations management and to generalize the findings across countries and industries. Success of some business decisions (e.g. globalization and merger and acquisition) necessitates recognition and reconciliation of the differences among HRM practices in different countries and industries. This study attempts to generalize the efficacy of seven HRM practices proposed by Pfeffer in the context of country and industry, focusing primarily on the effects of these practices on operations. The findings provide overall support for Pfeffer's seven HRM practices and empirically validate an ideal-type HRM system for manufacturing plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A cluster analysis of the survey data results in the identification of four patterns of QMS, which are labeled as undeveloped, frame, accommodating and strategic, respectively, according to the characteristics that each pattern displays. These four types of QMS were found to be associated with various organizational performance measures according to the stage of their development. The study suggests that organizations can improve their time-based operational performance by establishing a frame quality system. However, the overall performance of an electronics company can be enhanced only by the establishment of a strategic quality system (SQS), which requires the involvement of top management. Our investigation further suggests that the development of a QMS is influenced by top management's view on quality management. If quality management is viewed as an assurance system or a defensive strategy for answering customer requirements, a more advanced system will not be developed. The taxonomy developed here also enables researchers to understand the differences of major functions of quality systems at various stages of their development, the obstacles that management faces in the transformation process, and the corresponding strategies to be adopted.

In many cases, the achieved results have been much less than anticipated. Previous research suggests that in order to realize, maximum performance improvements it is necessary to access timely and informative customer demand data. While enterprise-wide information systems may contribute to the realization of this objective, operational processes, such as inventory management and mass customization may also be effective in improving the firm's inventory performance. This paper develops a structural equation model that evaluates the impact of enterprise-wide information systems, along with four operational processes, on inventory performance. The results indicate that the use of operational processes, especially just-in-time (JIT), rather than the use of enterprise-wide information systems, leads to improved performance as measured by inventory speculation, lead times, and turnover ratios.

When bottlenecks develop, for example, downstream operations may halt for lack of materials. A flexible worker can prevent this by moving in and increasing capacity temporarily, thereby avoiding work stoppages. In practice, it is not that simple. This paper identifies several "negative side effects" that occur in systems that rely on worker flexibility, effects that may partially or totally offset the advantages. Research has shown that performance feedback and work interruptions are factors that may explain some of these effects. Behavioral theories about those two factors lead to a series of hypotheses and two experiments. The results show that productivity loss due to these behavioral effects can be significant, in both the statistical and managerial sense of the word. Implications for the design and operation of flexible work environments are discussed, including methods for mitigating or eliminating the negative side effects, resulting in a meaningful productivity gain.

Using extensive shop floor from a medium-sized commercial firm, we discovered that the 'messy' data (i.e. high level of data variance) at the levels often lead to reduced decision maker confidence in the estimates of the learning rates. However, we also found that applying simple aggregation methods, we could better determine the accuracy of the predicted learning curve rates. confidence in the learning curve estimates is made possible by comparison of regression estimates made at the detailed level to those made at various aggregated data levels. Based upon our analysis of the empirical data, we are able to insights into the practical use of learning curve analysis and associated data aggregation with 'messy' shop floor data.

WOS:000180310200007	service; participation; satisfaction; effort; culture		1	Service customers expend significant effort through a variety of behaviors, before, during, and after encounters, to increase the likelihood of satisfactory service experience or to salvage failing service encounters. Service customers' satisfaction-seeking behaviors are both proactive and reactive in terms of both intent and execution. These behaviors include preparation, relationship building, information exchange, and intervention. This extension of the original research was presented by Youngdahl and Kellogg [Journal of Operations Management 15 (1997) 19]. It provides an examination of how robust the satisfaction-seeking behaviors are across cultures. The overall question is whether people in different cultures would use similar participative behaviors. We also examined whether or not culture is related to service customers' effort and satisfaction. The counter-intuitive findings indicate that service customers' satisfaction-seeking behaviors are not related to their cultural orientations. Additionally, culture is not related to effort or satisfaction level. The implication is that prescriptions derived from earlier research on these forms of service participation can be applied both across cultures and to any culturally diverse customer base.

Both subjective and objective data were collected. Some elements of labor and machine flexibility mediated the relationship between an emphasis on competitive priorities and mix flexibility. The interactive effects of machine and labor flexibility on mix flexibility confirmed prior findings that the pursuit of total flexibility is not desirable. For low levels of labor flexibility, increasing machine flexibility yields at the most a very moderate improvement in mix flexibility. When labor flexibility is high, increasing machine flexibility proves to be counter-productive. These results may suggest that the traditional forms of labor flexibility need to evolve when technological capabilities are more fully exploited. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Integration practices are grouped into two categories: (1) external strategic design integration, which reaches across firm boundaries to involve suppliers and customers and (2) internal design-process integration, which comprises more tactically oriented, integration practices that match design requirements and process capabilities. First, regression results show that both internal and external integration are related to time-based performance, which in turn is related to firm performance. Thus, two indirect routes to firm performance are identified. Second, hierarchical regression reveals that integration directly affects firm performance even after time-based performance is accounted for. Finally, we found that the interaction of internal and external integration is significantly related to both market share and financial performance (after controlling for all other effects). This latter result suggests that the joint use of external and internal integration practices has a synergistic effect on firm performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We further investigate contingency relationships between the development of a QMS and its organizational contexts. Based on cluster analyses of quality management practices measured by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) criteria, we found four patterns of service quality management practices: undeveloped, accommodating, strategic, and soft quality systems. Our research indicates that the type of quality system adopted by an organization is highly associated with organizational contextual factors. Our results indicate that environmental uncertainty shapes the development of a QMS in the early stage, while the perceived importance of quality induces the further development of a QMS to a strategic quality system. The results also show that small service firms that compete locally can achieve very good performance results using a soft quality system, a QMS with no formal process management systems. This research provides empirical evidence on contingent relationships among quality management practices, organizational context, and business performance, thus contributing to contingency theory in quality management.

For example, Deming proposed The Deming System of Profound Knowledge(TM) that dealt explicitly with knowledge. However, various authors in the quality field diverge considerably when contemplating knowledge. We propose an integrated view of quality and knowledge using Nonaka's theory of knowledge creation. This integrated view helps illuminate how quality practices can lead to knowledge creation and retention. The knowledge perspective also provides insight into what it means to effectively deploy quality management practices. Previous empirical research noted the importance of effective deployment, but provided little insight into what effective deployment means. This research argues that quality management practices create knowledge, which leads to organizational performance. Taking a knowledge-based view (KBV) of the firm provides a deeper understanding of why some organizations are more successful at deploying quality management practices than others.

Theatre plays were chosen as a basis for study because of their long history of mastering the critical elements of performance staging and the reputation for opening on time at near peak performance levels.

It develops the underlying theory for 'good' formal conceptual definitions by defining terms, demonstrating that formal conceptual definitions are needed for all theory-building empirical research, explains how and why 'good' formal conceptual definitions are used to develop properties and their measures, and last, it logically explains that good formal conceptual definitions are necessary conditions for construct validity (content validity, criterion validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity) while statistical tests are sufficient conditions for validity. This theory development explains why formal conceptual definitions are necessary before any traditional statistical empirical validity tests are performed. This study suggests that any statistical validity tests are not meaningful if the concept is not formally defined. In short, the theory of formal conceptual definitions provides a structure to develop 'good' measures of the formal theory that leads to 'good' empirical theory-building. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple regression analysis is used to test hypotheses using an existing data set of 165 plants in five countries and three industries. The findings indicate substantial differences in patterns of cumulative capabilities between countries and limited evidence of industry differences. Cumulative capabilities were found to be related to plant performance, with no difference in this relationship by industry. Support for sequential progression of cumulative capabilities was not evident, leading to the notion that development of cumulative capabilities is a complex endeavor, affected by many interrelated contingencies, not limited to sequence of development. A sequence of strategic initiative development was proposed and tested, finding support for a common foundation of practices related to cumulative capabilities, with limited support for the relationship between specific strategic initiatives and higher-level cumulative capabilities.

Yet, claims of the strategic role of purchasing have not been fully subjected to rigorous theoretical and empirical scrutiny. Extant research has remained largely anecdotal and theoretically under-developed. In this paper, we examine the links among strategic purchasing, supply management, and firm performance. We argue that strategic purchasing can engender sustainable competitive advantage by enabling firms to: (a) foster close working relationships with a limited number of suppliers; (b) promote open communication among supply-chain partners; and (c) develop long-term strategic relationship orientation to achieve mutual gains. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically test a number of hypothesized relationships based on a sample of 221 United States manufacturing firms. Our results provide robust support for the links between strategic purchasing, supply management, customer responsiveness, and financial performance of the buying firm. Implications for future research and managerial practice in supply-chain management are also offered. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Highly technical industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and service industries like banking are relying on fewer but more skilled workers. In these systems, productivity depends on worker availability and organization; therefore, modeling system performance may require accurate representations of individual worker behavior. This paper examines the tradeoffs in including information about the demographics and personalities of workers in system performance simulation models. A series of actual and simulated experiments in which personality and demographic data are used in different ways to model the performance of a team of workers is reported. Significant differences are found in predicted system performance demonstrating that model validity depends on the methodology used for modeling workers. These results have practical implication for the managerial processes of recruiting and selecting individual workers, as well as organizing teams of workers and assigning them to tasks.

These guided vehicles can be routed with a variety of vehicle dispatching rules in an attempt to meet performance criteria such as minimizing the average load waiting times. In this research, we use simulation models of three companies to evaluate the performance of several real-time vehicle dispatching rules, in part described in the literature. It appears that there is a clear difference in average load waiting time between the different dispatching rules in the different environments. Simple rules, based on load and vehicle proximity (distance-based) perform best for all cases. The penalty for this is a relatively high maximum load waiting time. A distance-based rule with time truncation, giving more priority to loads that have to wait longer than a time threshold, appears to yield the best possible overall performance. A rule that particularly considers load-waiting time performs poor overall. We also show that using little pre-arrival information of loads leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the dispatching rules without changing their performance ranking.

Using a model of a manually-paced assembly area, we examine three workforce management practices-the configuration of work teams, the extent of cross training, and the deployment of workers-that have the potential to enhance the level of manufacturing flexibility. We examine the effects of these practices at the level of the individual operation and individual worker, with the goal of maximizing overall system performance in a variety of manufacturing environments. Our results indicate that the value of workforce flexibility is contingent upon characteristics of the operating environment. Environments having high levels of product variety call for the use of a larger number of parallel work teams, while environments with highly complex tasks tend to require a smaller number of parallel teams. Further, the value of cross training and worker task sharing is diminished as work tasks become more complex, due to learning and forgetting effects on the workforce. The overall implication is that more worker flexibility does not always yield improved system performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Driving this project was recognition that the current process, initially designed to accommodate a single customer group, was ill equipped to handle a changing customer mix now consisting of three disparate groups. The resulting mismatch between the process and users created long delays and an increase in the overall level of dissatisfaction with the existing process. To improve overall performance, this study turned to process analysis and computer simulation to stimulate a critical analysis of the process. As part of this approach, the study investigated three layouts: the existing worker paced assembly line, a modified assembly line, and service cells. The study examined the relationship between layout, customer mix and system performance. Key among the results was that a service cell approach led to higher performance and better customer satisfaction. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changing competitive dynamics are placing heavy demands on conventional metrics systems, and creating stresses throughout firms and their supply chains. Research has not kept pace with these new demands in an environment where it is no longer sufficient to simply let metrics evolve over time-we must learn how to proactively design and manage them. The intent of this paper is to convey the importance and need for metrics-related research. An outline of the important characteristics of the metrics research topic is provided. Specifically, we address the functions of metrics; their focus and tense; their operational and strategic contexts; as well as discuss the distinction between metrics, metrics sets and metrics systems. Some initial theoretical grounding for the research topic is provided through agency theory. We conclude with a discussion of the intent and process of the special issue, and introduction of the associated articles. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite its importance, this is one area that many organizations fail to address effectively. This paper reports exploratory empirical results, obtained from an on-line survey, on the relative emphasis and types of performance measurements and analysis approaches used by organizations in manufacturing, service, and not-for-profit (including education and health care) sectors. The results suggest that organizations with more mature performance measurement systems report better results in terms of customer, financial, and market performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It further examines the possibility of using DEA over time as a basis for continuous improvement. To help productivity improvements, the DEA results for the first time period were implemented at the five selected JMSs located in Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Chaiyi, and Kaoshiung. The findings show that most of previously inefficient JMSs, on average, have become relative more efficient through DEA recommendation remedial actions. Three JMSs increased their technical and pure technical efficiencies; and one JMS increased its scale efficiency. Few JMSs were operating at increasing returns to scale, indicating a potential to expand. As such, it can be a valuable benchmarking tool for the JMS managers and assist in efficiently using scare resources to produce productivity. Finally, the Army has accepted DEA as a performance measurement tool for JMSs. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the same time, rigorous examinations of the psychometric properties of such performance measurements instruments have not been performed. Especially needed are examinations of systematic informant bias and the related method variance and method bias, which are not captured by conventional methods used in operations management to assess construct reliability and validity. We conduct a multitrait-multimethod analysis of perceptual performance measures to investigate item-specific trait, method and error variance. Data from 164 factories with three informants per factory is analyzed. We find that while random error and systematic bias account for a large portion of item variance, perceptual measures satisfy the requirements of reliability and validity. However, we caution against the use of single-informant studies in future research as substantive conclusions may be affected. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a developing country, China has to balance economic and environmental performance. Green supply chain management (GSCM) is emerging to be an important approach for Chinese enterprises to improve performance, possibly on both these dimensions. Using empirical results from 186 respondents on GSCM practice in Chinese manufacturing enterprises, we examine the relationships between GSCM practice and environmental and economic performance. Using moderated hierarchical regression analysis, we evaluate the general relationships between specific GSCM practices and performance. We then investigate how two primary types of management operations philosophies, quality management and just-in-time (or lean) manufacturing principles, influence the relationship between GSCM practices and performance. Significant findings were determined for a number of relationships. Managerial implications are also identified. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Advocates of TQM have suggested that there should be a positive relationship between implementing TQM practices and financial performance measures. The empirical evidence supporting this assertion, however, is limited at best. Most of the research has been limited to surveys of managers' perceptions of the effect of TQM on financial performance. A few empirical studies using financial performance measures have been done, and have shown that TQM firms have better financial performance than other firms. However, better performing companies may be more likely to adopt TQM, so that rather than being a path to improved financial success (causation), TQM merely "comes along for the ride" (covariation). This study examined the relationship between TQM and financial performance, using a sample of Baldrige Award winners and replicated with a second sample of state quality award winning companies, and three different sets of financial performance measures. Both Baldrige and state quality award winners generally had better financial performance than their peers after winning a quality award, and before. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposition that plants with generic manufacturing strategies that are consistent (fit) with operational objectives will experience relatively higher levels of performance than others is tested using data from multiple countries and industries. A simultaneous estimation analysis revealed significant relationships between generic manufacturing strategies and plant performance, when accounting for operational objectives and while controlling for country, industry, and size effects.

This novel perspective has created the challenge of designing and managing a network of interdependent relationships developed and fostered through strategic collaboration. Although research interests in supply chain management (SCM) are growing, no research has been directed towards a systematic development of SCM instruments. This Study identifies and consolidates various supply chain initiatives and factors to develop key SCM constructs conducive to advancing the field. To this end, we analyzed over 400 articles and synthesized the large, fragmented body of work dispersed across many disciplines. The result of this study, through successive stages of measurement analysis and refinement, is a set of reliable, valid. and unidimensional measurements that can be subsequently used in different contexts to refine or extend conceptualization and measurements or to test various theoretical models, paving the way for theory building in SCM.

At the same time. regulatory agencies, industry experts, and consumers increasingly demand that health care organizations learn from prior failures to prevent recurrence. Building on the notion that learning from operational failures requires an accurate Understanding of their nature, this paper reports on an in-depth study of operational failures encountered by hospital nurses. Data analysis suggests that in this context (1) most operational failures stem from breakdowns in the supply of materials and information across organizational boundaries and (2) employees quickly compensate for most failures. We propose that these two conditions-lack of control of processes that create failures and the ease with which employees restore functioning-make it difficult for organizations to recognize these incidents as learning opportunities, and if they do, to capitalize on the opportunity. This has an important implication for efforts to generate organizational learning and improvement from employees' experiences with failures. Highly interdependent front-line workers do not control organizational processes responsible for the majority of failures they encounter and have a difficult task convincing powerful associates that these obstacles wan-ant solution efforts, making it likely operational failures will persist.

Consequently in this paper, we address the issue of manufacturing flexibility measurement. and then use these measures to better understand flexibility. Churchill's [J. Market. Res. 16 (1979) 64] paradigm is used to develop psychometrically sound measures for six oft-used dimensions of manufacturing flexibility: machine, labor, material handling, mix, new product, and modification. Previous research shows that each of these dimensions, in turn, is comprised of four elements. The resulting 24 scales (6 dimensions x 4 elements) demonstrate the desired properties of unidimensionality. reliability. and validity. We show further that the four elements of any given manufacturing flexibility dimension can be grouped into two conceptually separate factors representing "Scope" and "Achievability" of flexible responses. Scope and achievability factor scores can be used to compare a subset of firms with respect to their flexibility choices, and observe the trade-offs firms make both within and across flexibility dimensions. Along with scale development, establishing scope versus achievability relationships between flexibility elements provides a better basis for measuring and creating a holistic understanding of this complex concept.

More of the contact a customer has with the firm is likely to be with the back-office and, therefore, mediated by technology. While previous operations management research has been important for its contributions to our understanding of customer contact in face-to-face settings, considerably less work has been done to improve our understanding of customer contact in what we refer to as technology-mediated settings (e.g., via telephone, instant messaging (IM), or email). This paper builds upon the service operations management (SOM) literature on customer contact by theoretically defining and empirically developing new multi-item measurement scales specifically designed for assessing technology-mediated customer contact. Seminal works on customer contact theory and its empirical measurement are employed to provide a foundation for extending these concepts to technology-mediated contexts. We also draw upon other important frameworks, including the Service Profit Chain, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the concept of media/information richness, in order to identify and define our constructs. We follow a rigorous empirical scale development process to create parsimonious sets of survey items that exhibit satisfactory levels of reliability and validity to be useful in advancing SOM empirical research in the emerging Internet-enabled back-office.

Data was used from a survey of 164 dyads composed of a purchasing manager and a counterpart in a firm that they identified as their most cooperative suppliers. Higher levels of inter-organizational cooperative behaviors such as shared planning and flexibility in coordinating activities were found to be strongly linked to the supplier's trust in the buyer firm. However, not all of the types of cooperative behaviors, particularly joint responsibility for problem solving, had significant impacts on the buyer's perceptions of the relationship's performance.

Supplier evaluations, one type of supplier development program (SDP), are an attempt to meet current and future business needs by improving supplier performance and capabilities. The purpose of this study was to determine how suppliers perceive the buying firm's supplier evaluation communication process and its impact on suppliers' performance. Three communication strategies (indirect influence strategy, formality and feedback) were tested separately and one in unison (collaborative). Using structural equation modeling (SEM) and data collected from 139 first-tier North American automotive suppliers, the results of this research have shown that, contrary to the SDP literature from the buying firm's perspective, the supplier's perceptions of the buying firm's communication does not directly influence suppliers' performance. Specifically, the supplier evaluation communication process does not ensure improved supplier performance unless the supplier is committed to the buying firm. Buying firms can influence the supplier's commitment through increased efforts of cooperation and commitment. The results also indicate that when a buying firm utilizes collaborative communication, the supplier perceives a positive influence on the buyer Supplier relationship. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, neo-institutional arguments can shed light on the determinants of manufacturing practice adoption and implementation. We juxtapose both theoretically and empirically three different theoretical perspectives that can be used to address the phenomenon: strategic contingency, structural contingency and neo-institutional arguments. A preliminary empirical test of the three competing perspectives is tested in a sample of 164 manufacturing plants. We find that the institutional perspective explains much more of the variance in the practices adopted and implemented by the plants than either the structural contingency or the strategic contingency theories. This motivates future research using some of the less familiar theoretical approaches. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While development of manufacturing flexibilities is desirable and indeed critical for some firms, exploiting the flexibility capabilities to achieve tangible firm-level performance outcomes through effective execution is becoming increasingly important. This paper presents a conceptual model that introduces two new constructs: flexibility competence and execution competence as distinct from manufacturing flexibility. Based on the proposed conceptual model and a multistage data envelopment analysis (MDEA) of empirical data, the roles of flexibility and execution competencies in determining performance are examined. The results indicate that some firms are more effective than others in exploiting investments in advanced manufacturing technologies and strategic sourcing initiatives to develop manufacturing flexibilities. Thus, lending credibility to the new construct referred to as flexibility competence. We also conclude that some firms are more effective than others in converting manufacturing flexibilities into tangible firm-level performance, suggesting that execution competence is an important construct that needs attention. We suggest future research in this area for comprehensively investigating these two new constructs proposed in this paper and identifying the factors that influence them.

Even though the theory of supply and demand chain management suggests that lead time reduction is an antecedent to the use of market mediation (i.e., adjusting production to fit actual customer demand as it materializes) [Harvard Business Rev. 75 (2) (1997) 105] to reduce transaction uncertainty in the chain, which can be conceptualized as the primary goal of supply chain management [J. Operat. Manage. 11 (3) (1993) 289], demand chain parties often are observed in practice to begin with information transfer improvement, ignoring the problem of long lead times. In this paper, we propose a framework for prioritizing lead time reduction in a demand chain improvement project, using a typology of demand chains to identify and recommend trajectories to achieve desirable levels of market mediation performance.

Burnes, G.M. Stalker, The Management of Innovation, Tavistock Publications, London, 1961]. Similarly, the operations management literature has focused on the importance of flexibility as a competitive weapon [e.g., De Meyer et al., 1989 Strategic Manage. J. 10 (1989) 135], and as a response to environmental uncertainty [Manage. Sci. 33 (1987) 509; Manage. Sci. 39 (1993) 395]. However, our recent attempts to empirically validate a relationship between environmental uncertainty and operational flexibility in manufacturing plants have failed to show a significant relationship [J.

An analysis of data that measure hundreds of electronic commerce transactions along with data at the firm level shows that higher shipping and handling charges are good indicators of better PDS quality. Other transaction-level conditions and firm-level attributes also affect PDS quality, as measured by availability, timeliness, and reliability. Most notably, when the net price of products transacted increases, PDS reliability and availability decline. Furthermore, Internet-retailer size is found to favor PDS availability whereas, surprisingly, newer Internet retailers exhibit a higher level of PDS availability than many of their incumbent competitors.

They are: (1) managerial effectiveness; (2) scale of operations and potential for a given market area (and efficiency of resource allocation given the scale); and (3) understanding the resource heterogeneity via programmatic differences in efficiency. Overall, the efficiency differences identified raised insightful questions regarding top management's selection of the appropriate form and type of inputs and outputs, as well as questions regarding the DEA model form selected.

In this study, we present a discrete event simulation model inspired by and validated in an actual manufacturing setting that includes short product life cycles, mid-volume production quantities, and a production environment consisting of assembly, inspection and testing. The effect of worker skill dynamics is analyzed using a factorial experimental design that contrasts the use of temporary versus permanent workers on manufacturing cost performance. The manufacturing costs assessed include labor, inspection and testing. The cost of reworking a defect is captured as an increase in the labor consumption. Materials costs are not assessed. At the core of the analysis, it is assumed that temporary workers have relatively less skill and therefore have higher average production times, higher average defect rates associated with their assembly activity, and lower rates of learning. In addition, the variance of the production time is higher for the temporary workers. Despite these indicators of performance problems, temporary workers may be used because of the considerably lower wage rate compared to permanent employees. Our in-depth case analyses shows that assigning skilled permanent workers to upstream build operations was superior to other policies deploying temporary workers, regardless of lot size or product complexity. Attesting to the importance of the labor mix component of manufacturing strategy, workforce deployment policies tended to dominate product switching frequency (a proxy variable for lot size and product mix) in impacting costs.

Based on the literature and a case study we identified two stages in implementing ISO 9000-(1) Installation, which has two dimensions: (a) external coordination and (b) integration; and (2) Usage, which also has two dimensions: (a) in daily practice and (b) as a catalyst for change. The hypotheses were that installation of ISO 9000 is positively related to use of ISO 9000, and use of ISO 9000 is positively related to operating performance. In addition, use of ISO 9000 is positively related to business performance since operating performance is positively related to business performance. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) to test our hypotheses and validated the results by comparing the longitudinal perfomance of ISO 9000 certified companies with four matched samples of companies that were not ISO 9000 certified. Our analysis indicated that while the installation stage was necessary to successfully implement ISO 9000, organizations achieved a distinct operating advantage from this replicable standard when they used it in daily practice and as a catalyst for change. These findings were based on responses to a survey of 1150 quality managers in 924 organizations, which was supplemented for about one-third of the organizations with longitudinal information from the Compustat database on the organizations' business and operating performance. The validation indicated that implementing the ISO 9000 standard led to improved operating performance, but that this outcome did not necessarily or automatically yield better business performance.

In other words, just as the relationship with the suppliers does, the relationships between suppliers have strategic implications for the buyer. We present in this study eight cases that describe supplier-supplier relationship dynamics. Using theory building through case studies, we identify five archetypes of supplier-supplier relationships.

A review of 103 survey-based articles published in the Journal of Operations Management between 1993 and 2001 shows that listwise deletion, which is often the least accurate technique of dealing with missing data, is heavily utilized by OM researchers. The paper also discusses the research implications of missing data, types of missing data and concludes with recommendations on which techniques should be used under different circumstances in order to improve the treatment of missing data in OM survey research.

Researchers and practicing managers contend that design engineers may play an important role in product development efforts. However, their effect on the product development process is not well understood and the extent of their impact on product development performance has not been adequately accessed. This research defines the changing role of design engineers, and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge about customers. The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of design engineers, clarity of project targets, shared knowledge about customers and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of design engineers expands the clarity of project targets increase. This increase impacts the extent of shared knowledge about customers. Increases in the clarity of project targets and shared knowledge about customers appear to enhance product development productivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We mathematically model and develop simulation-based rolling schedule procedures for analyzing the manufacturer's ordering policies, transportation activities, and the vendor's manufacturing and order fulfillment processes under five alternative integration strategies. Our objective is to measure the value of information sharing and system coordination across the strategies, identify whether the source of the benefits come from information sharing or coordination, study the allocation of system benefits among channel members, and analyze the impact of environmental factors on system cost performance. The experimental results indicate a 47.58% cost reduction moving from a traditional supply chain to a fully integrated system. While information sharing reduces costs, the main economic benefit comes from coordinated decision-making. The savings associated with system integration are not equally allocated among channel members, and vary by strategy. The procedures developed in the research provide economic insight that fosters the sharing of technological and strategic efforts. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our research context is the full-service restaurant table mix problem. This problem, which is quite new to the literature, finds the optimal number of different size tables for a restaurant to maximize its value (revenue or contribution) generating potential. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of eight heuristic techniques for the problem using two experiments. The first experiment uses data from a 240-seat full-service restaurant to evaluate all eight heuristics, while the second experiment investigates the performance of selected heuristics under a broader set of environmental factors. The results of our first experiment showed that the better of the simulated annealing heuristic variants yielded the optimal solution in seven of eight test problems, averaging within 0.1% of optimal. Our second experiment showed that the simplest of the models we investigated yielded solutions within 1% of the simulated annealing solution. Finally, we observed that altering the table mix on a daily basis increased performance by over 1% compared to maintaining the optimal weekly table mix. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effective supply chain management (SCM) has become a potentially valuable way of securing competitive advantage and improving organizational performance. This research conceptualizes, develops, and validates six dimensions of SCM practices (strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, information sharing, information quality, internal lean practices, and postponement). Data for the study were collected from 196 organizations and the measurement scales were tested and validated using structural equation modeling. It is hoped that this study will provide a parsimonious measurement instrument to assess the performance of the overall supply chain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Each grocer follows a different operations strategy as determined by choice of where to fulfill customer orders (from existing stores or from a dedicated DC) and by choice of delivery method (direct to the customer's home/office or indirect via customer pickup or third-party logistics provider). The survey data from customers are used to assess the degree of integration between marketing and operations and the relationship with customer behavioral intentions. The results indicate that eBusiness-, product-, and service-quality, all have a significant direct effect on customer behavioral intentions to purchase again. There is limited support for technology as a moderating factor. Finally, the relationships between the predictor variables and customer behavioral intentions differ across grocers. This supports the idea that grocers utilizing different operational strategies should focus attention on different facets of their business and provides insight as to where efforts should be directed.

Hill [Hill, T., 1985. Manufacturing Strategy: The Strategic Management of the Manufacturing Function, first ed. Macmillan, Basingstoke; Hill, T., 2000. Manufacturing Strategy: Text and Cases, second ed. Palgrave, Basingstoke] proposed the order-winners framework to help managers to improve understanding about markets and to develop a consistent manufacturing strategy. The framework defines ideal profiles of products and markets, and manufacturing and investment decisions that relate to alternative process choices. The study tests the hypothesis of a negative relationship between misfit to an ideal profile defined in the framework and business performance in domestic market share, return on sales, and return on investment in a survey of 183 manufacturers from 17 countries. Results found a significant negative relationship between misfit and domestic market share. The study contributes to operations management research by developing a methodology to measure fit as profile deviation in the context of manufacturing, and applying this methodology to the order-winners framework.

The growing number of articles on BOSC in the literature is an indication of the importance of the strategy and of its role in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective of a BOSC strategy is to meet the requirements of individual customers by leveraging the advantages of outsourcing and information technology. There are not many research articles that provide an overview of BOSC, despite the fact that this strategy is being promoted as the operations paradigm of the future. The main objective of this research is to (i) review the concepts of BOSC, (ii) develop definitions of BOSC, (iii) classify the literature based on a suitable classification scheme, leading to some useful insights into BOSC and some future research directions, (iv) review the selected articles on BOSC for their contribution to the development and operations of BOSC, (v) develop a framework for BOSC, and (vi) suggest some future research directions. The literature has been reviewed based on the following four major areas of decision-making: organizational competitiveness, the development and implementation of BOSC, the operations of BOSC, and information technology in BOSC. Some of the important observations are: (a) there is a lack of adequate research on the design and control of BOSC, (b) there is a need for further research on the implementation of BOSC, (c) human resource issues in BOSC have been ignored, (d) issues of product commonality and modularity from the perspective of partnership or supplier development require further attention and (e) the trade-off between responsiveness and the cost of logistics needs further study.

We examine the relationship and supply chain processes between a notebook computer manufacturer and five component suppliers. Two distinct reaction strategies emerge from these five buyer-supplier dyads. The "reduce uncertainty" strategy emphasizes supply contracts with a high degree of restrictiveness, relatively infrequent schedule revisions, and a high level of form postponement. The "cope with uncertainty" strategy emphasizes flexible supply contracts, relatively frequent schedule revisions, and low levels of form postponement. Eight propositions are formulated to understand the linkage between a supplier's power, its short-term process flexibility, and the elements of its reaction strategy. The paper concludes by proposing future research directions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that a BTO strategy positively affects market performance through its influence on the application of supply chain knowledge downstream with customers. Although a JIT strategy does affect the upstream application of knowledge with suppliers, the latter does not predict market performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are presented.

We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to study the effect of offering price incentives to those customers who are willing to commit themselves to purchasing the cheaper-to-produce standardized product. The market's reaction to price incentives is captured by modeling the probabilistic behavior of two exclusive groups of customers who may be "price-sensitive" or "price-insensitive" and who are willing to commit themselves. We develop an analytic expression for the distribution of the demand for the BOP conditional on the actual number of committed demands for SP following the price-incentive announcement. We show that price incentives expand the total expected demand while reducing demand uncertainty and we present conditions under which it is optimal to offer a price incentive. Sequentially made price incentive and capacity decisions for the BOP that maximize expected profit are obtained by solving the dynamic programming problem. We provide a comparative statics analysis and examine the effect of varying parameter values on the optimal price-incentive discount rate. We also describe a numerical study and present a sensitivity analysis of the profit improvement obtained after offering price incentives. We show that for low purchase probability, large number of customers in the price-sensitive group and high profit margin price incentives can substantially improve the expected profit.

The firm will see an increase in demand, but face some operational difficulties. One of these is related to the return policy which is now a recognized tool to win customer orders. This is even more true for increasingly popular Internet sales where the opportunity to physically examine the product is absent. A tremendous advantage can be gained by the Internet firm if it could offer a return policy for BTO products. We propose the use of modularity in the product design as a solution to this problem. From manufacturer's point of view, following a policy of modularization and offering a generous return policy would increase revenue, but also increase the cost due to increased likelihood of return and increased cost of design. We develop a profit maximization model to jointly obtain optimal polices for return policy and modularity level in terms of certain market reaction parameters. We obtain a number of managerial guidelines for using marketing and operational strategy variables to influence those reaction parameters so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the market.

Derived from successes in other industries, the benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead-times have been pointed out. While the theoretical discussion of such 'build-to-order' (BTO) strategies is well advanced, the dynamic feasibility of implementing these concepts is far from understood. Using a simulation of a multi-tier supply chain-system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities with the objective of determining the scope for potential improvements in responsiveness of the supply chain. The simulation results show that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand, as well as due to the strong reliance on forecasting in the scheduling process. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how to improve current scheduling systems towards increasing the content of vehicles built to customer order. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Agile manufacturing (AM) is a manufacturing paradigm that focuses on smaller scale, modular production facilities, and agile operations capable of dealing with turbulent and changing environments. From several enablers of AM, virtual enterprise (VE) and information technology (IT) were chosen. This empirical study explored the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance in an AM setting. Extensive data collection strategy and several tests are used to establish the reliability and validity of the data collected. Extensive analyses of the data using structural equation molding were performed for five hypotheses. The results indicate that both VE and IT had positive influences on business performance. It was also established that the alignment between VE and IT had a positive impact on business performance. Further, it was shown that the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance was more significant than the impact of VE and IT on business performance individually. In conclusion, the assessment of the results along with future research directions is provided. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditional approaches historically employed by manufacturers, such as the use of planning bills and standard interactions among suppliers and buyers, may not prove to be as effective in this new environment. In our research, we first seek to differentiate the traditional Made to Stock (MTS) environment from the emerging Build to Order (BTO) one. In addition, given the global nature of supply chains today, we also compare BTO operations in developed countries with those in the developing world. The results from this study can be useful to practicing managers because we provide specific directions on aligning supply chains for the BTO environment across the globe. In addition, this research adds to the theoretical development of postponement strategies in manufacturing, and establishes empirical links between the international operations, build to order environment, and supply chain literatures.

This special issue on Coordinating Product Design, Process Design, and Supply Chain Design Decisions was conceived early 2003 to bring awareness to and to spur scholarly research into this topic. In doing so, we cast a wide net from both content and methodological perspectives, encouraging interdisciplinary papers that were theory-building and/or theory-testing in purpose using either empirical-based (e.g., case research, survey research, historical research, etc.) and/or modeling (i.e., optimization or simulation) methodologies. The resulting seven papers represent the fruits of this harvest and are being presented in two consecutive parts. Whereas Part A introduces the three papers that speak to the performance implications of coordinating product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design decisions, Part B introduces the remaining four papers that address how and why these three decision areas can be coordinated.

Specifically, this paper considers the specific scenario of optimizing the configuration of the supply chain system given commonality among platform products. The paper uses and extends the concept of Generic Bills of Materials (GBOM) of a product family as a unified framework for qualitatively capturing and representing the structure of its supply chain. This qualitative model is then enhanced by a mathematical model developed to quantify the relationships among various design decisions. Endeavoring to solve the mathematical model more efficiently, we propose an effective heuristic method using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Although GA generally does not guarantee the optimal solution, the best heuristic solutions obtained in this study are consistent with the optimal solutions obtained using Dynamic Programming. The resulting mathematical model and solution algorithm are then used to investigate the mutual impact between the design decisions of platform products and of processes in the supply chain through sensitivity analyses. Several useful managerial insights are generated and discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The following two questions serve as the motivation for the study: Do customer expectations of order fulfillment processes vary across product types? Should the product type matter in configuring order fulfillment processes? From the studies in the marketing literature, we infer that customer satisfaction assessments are based on customer expectations of order fulfillment processes, and that these expectations systematically vary across the three product types: convenience goods (e.g., groceries, home and office supplies), shopping goods (e.g., ready-to-wear men, women, and kids' apparel), and specialty goods (e.g., desktop and notebook computers, and wedding dresses). In particular, we posit that ceteris paribus, customer satisfaction with order fulfillment will decrease moving along a continuum of product types, from convenience goods to specialty goods. The empirical analysis for this study is based on data collected on dimensions of customer satisfaction with order fulfillment from a sample of 256 firms engaged in electronic B2C transactions. Firms included in our study sample are such that their products can be classified into only one of three product types: convenience, shopping, or specialty goods. In essence, each firm in the study sample is a proxy for one of three product types. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that, on average, customers tend to have higher satisfaction levels with the order fulfillment process of convenience and shopping goods than with the order fulfillment process of specialty goods. We discuss the managerial implications of our results, contributions of the paper to the literature, limitations, and directions for future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The revised structures often involve delaying the delivery of the products until after the customer orders arrive, termed time postponement (TP), or delaying the differentiation of the products until later production stages, termed form postponement (FP). We develop models representing possible implementations of the TP and FP structures and compare their performance in total supply chain cost and expected customer waiting times. We find that once the number of different products increases above some threshold level, the TP structure is preferred under both performance metrics. For the most general model, a numerical experiment was designed to investigate how different factors affect the performance of the TP and FP structures. Through this experiment we show that higher arrival time and process time variations make the FP structure more favorable while increases in the number of products and higher interest rates make the TP structure more favorable. We also offer guidance to managers using either structure on where to allocate resources for performance improvement. For example, to improve the customer waiting times under the FP structure, increasing the coverage of the generic component and reducing the number of products provide larger benefits than reducing the variability of the arrival and process times.

These four papers seek to provide answers to the following two questions: "What mechanisms allow product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design decisions to be coordinated?" and "Why should decisions with respect to product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design be coordinated?" Each of the four papers compiled in Part B provides, foremost, an approach to coordinate decisions across the domains of product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design. The proposed coordinating mechanisms range from a network-based modeling approach to an assessment procedure for evaluating product architectures to the integration of relevant suppliers into the new product development (NPD) process to a goal programming modeling approach. The fourth paper in Part B, in fact, deploys the proposed goal programming modeling approach to identify and formalize the potential tradeoffs among decisions across the three domains.

This difficulty is compounded when the need to model the effects of product and process design changes are also considered. Yet there could be considerable benefits in designing supply chains taking into account the operation of the supply chain as well as the design of the product and the design of the manufacturing processes used in the supply chain. This paper aims to address the central research issue of developing a methodology that can assist a manager in making decisions by modeling both the operation of a supply chain design and the effects of product and process design decisions. The proposed methodology, called Product Chain Decision Model (PCDM), is presented in this paper. This uses an abstracted network to model supply chain systems. Finally, an industry example of joint supply chain and product design is described to illustrate the application of PCDM. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3D-CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed-Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D-CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi-dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product-operation strategy combinations.

Prior research has indicated that the integration of material suppliers into the new product development (NPD) cycle can provide substantial benefits towards achieving these goals. This involvement may range from simple consultation with suppliers on design ideas to making suppliers fully responsible for the design of components or systems they will supply. Moreover, suppliers may be involved at different stages of the new product development process. Early supplier involvement is a key coordinating process in supply chain design, product design and process design. Several important questions regarding supplier involvement in new product development remain unanswered. Specifically, we look at the issue of what managerial practices affect new product development team effectiveness when suppliers are to be involved. We also consider whether these factors differ depending on when the supplier is to be involved and what level of responsibility is to be given to the supplier. Finally, we examine whether supplier involvement in new product development can produce significant improvements in financial returns and/or product design performance. We test these proposed relationships using survey data collected from a group of global organizations and find support for the relationships based on the results of a multiple regression analysis.

The model enables straightforward representation of the interrelations among multiple objectives and analysis of tradeoffs among those that exhibit conflicts. The model is demonstrated through a discussion of integrality versus modularity in product and supply chain designs that is motivated by events that took place in the automotive industry over the last decade. A numerical example is used to illustrate the model and the paper concludes with possible extensions and guidelines for implementation. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The reality is that the not-for-profit is a far more complex organization that is responsible to diverse groups of stakeholders. Unlike for-profit organizations, not-for-profit (NFP) organizations have to focus on dual, and often conflicting, goals relating to fulfilling their overall mission while also generating enough revenue to maintain their operating structures. In order to better understand the nature of the dual orientation of the NFP organization, the behavior of Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) patrons using the CSO website is viewed. Specifically, this study examines data for individuals purchasing CSO, concert tickets on-line during an 8-month period in 2000-2001. MANOVA and ANOVA statistical procedures are used to analyze the effects of both the economic and mission related orientations operationalized through the e-service encounter. Further, we view data from the online ticketing function relative to the labor costs of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although volunteers work alongside or in some cases replace employees in the delivery of service, incorporating volunteer labor into the service delivery system of the not-for-profit poses unique challenges. Understanding these challenges represents an important foundation building step in understanding the implications for service design and service operations when using volunteers. This paper identifies and describes service design and operational factors relevant to volunteer satisfaction in not-for-profit organizations. Using data collected from 288 volunteers working in 43 not-for-profit agencies, the study explores the elements of service delivery that impact volunteer satisfaction, and further tests the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and loyalty to the not-for-profit organization. Findings include that satisfied volunteers are more likely to remain for longer periods of time with the same organization, are more likely to donate financially to the not-for-profit, and are more likely to recommend the volunteer experience to others. Each of these outcomes helps to ensure the continued sustainability of the not-for-profit organization. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We consider a total of 169 branch offices of the agency located in 79 counties that process a variety of transactions and provide services including automobile registrations, issuance of driver licenses, recreational vehicle registration, and personal identification registry. The proposed methodology and decision support system incorporate a number of factors such as branch office efficiencies based on multiple measures, budget restrictions, capacity limitations for processing transactions, and demand requirements in designing an efficient service system. Our approach employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) models. A series of experiments are conducted with the proposed model by varying, the levels of system-wide efficiency, resource reallocation, and budget in generating a set of decisions that executive management of the agency can implement. In addition, we investigate service channel management issues that the agency is currently facing in providing the services by web, phone, facsimile, and mail in addition to branch offices. We discuss how the branch closures influence channel management decisions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper reports the result of an empirical study comparing application of service management principles in one public sector area, further education (FE) colleges, with private sector service organizations. Although within our sample marked differences exist between the levels of service drivers and outcomes, our findings suggest that the same management model is applicable to both sectors. Based on a sample of 291 service organizations, we demonstrate that a managerial model, represented by the service profit chain, is valid in both our FE college and private sector sample. Specifically, progressive human resource management practices led to employee satisfaction, which in turn impacted both service quality and customer satisfaction in both the public and private organizations. The results indicate that the performance of FE colleges arose in part from the managerial choices made in adoption of practices, and that it is lack of employee focus that may be holding back performance. Relevant to both public and private sectors is that the research indicates that human resource factors have a stronger impact than quality procedures, on both service quality and customer satisfaction.

Specifically, we examine the widespread problem of developing course schedules in not-for-profit university settings. We investigate the potential benefit of incorporating, into the scheduling process, information on the unconstrained demand of students for courses. Prior to this study, the status quo in our college, like that in a large proportion of university settings, was building the course schedule to avoid time conflicts between required courses and to minimize time conflicts between designated groups of courses, such as electives in a particular area. Compared to the status quo approach, we find that, based on three semester's worth of actual data, an approach that explicitly considers students' course preferences improves a student-based metric of schedule quality on the order of over 4% (which is the equivalent, in our setting, of improving service for over 20% of students).

Quality management practices provide the unit of analysis for studying this linkage. The theory of organizational publicness is used to establish that organizations can be defined on a continuum of publicness rather than as purely public or purely private. Particular cultural factors, political influences, and organizational characteristics define this publicness. The study investigates the linkage between four publicness dimensions (ownership, goal setting, funding, and control) and operations-related quality practices (information and analysis, staff focus, and process management) in U.S. hospitals. The results of regression analysis show that the publicness dimensions of ownership and control are related to some quality management practices, with control (i.e. public responsibility and compliance) having a significant effect throughout the studied models. Hospital goal setting and funding, two additional publicness dimensions, are not significantly related to quality management practices. The results of this study build our understanding of how operations practices are used in public organizations and help to define the extent to which publicness matters. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainty and welfare economics of medical care. The American Economic Review, 5, 941-973]. For-profit healthcare entities face an inherent conflict between providing profits to investors and health welfare to patients. Thus, non-profit entities exist as a signal and evidence of higher quality services. To date, research examining differences in quality between for-profit and non-profit nursing homes has focused on a direct link between outcome quality and non-profit status. These studies have produced inconclusive or mixed results. We argue that non-profit or for-profit status and outcome quality are linked via two Intermediate factors, namely process quality and input quality. Consistent with many prior studies, we report no direct link between non-profit status and outcome quality. However, we report that process quality is indeed higher at non-profit nursing homes than for-profit nursing homes, but that input quality is lower. We also examine the association between outcome quality with process and input quality. We report that different aspects of process quality are tied to better outcome quality, but report several notable exceptions. This research provides support for Arrow's hypothesis at the process level and gives insights into the link between process quality, input quality and outcome quality in the nursing home environment.

One purpose of the research described in this paper is to empirically test the influences of supply chain power on supplier satisfaction. Exploration of the effects of power on factors of supplier satisfaction will provide the key to understanding the power-satisfaction link in supply chain relationships. This paper shows how the buyer-seller relationship affects supplier satisfaction. In doing so, previous satisfaction and power literature is pulled together to demonstrate that the power-satisfaction variable must be included in any examination of supply chain partnerships. The three primary objectives of this research are to establish how the different "bases of power" affect the satisfaction of selling firms, investigate how power driven relationships affect supplier satisfaction, and measure the effect of power influences on supplier satisfaction in the automobile industry. Each of these research objectives was achieved. This study establishes the first empirical evidence for the measurement of power-driven supplier satisfaction. In each of the nine models studied, the power-affected buyer-supplier relationship was found to have a significant positive effect on both performance and satisfaction. The paths between performance and satisfaction, however, were consistently found to be nonsignificant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such classification schemes, though helpful in deciphering critical management issues and positioning strategies between service industries, tend to treat an entire industry, such as airlines, as a single homogenous entity. However, organizations in the same industry often use intangible resources, such as entrepreneurial orientation processes, to compete with one another. Resource-advantage theory suggests that organizations utilize intangible resources to build long-term strategies and a sustainable competitive advantage leading to superior performance. We developed organization clusters based on entrepreneurial orientation as intangible resources to classify organizations within a retailing industry. Using data from the retail pharmacy industry, we tested if the entrepreneurial orientations of the resultant groups within the pharmacy industry were related to their perception of the environment, organizational factors, and performance outcomes. The operationalization of the construct of entrepreneurial orientation is one of the contributions of the study. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the conceptual level, we reposition and reframe the "universality of TQM" question in light of two conflicting theoretical perspectives in the international business literature - one that supports the universal applicability of TQM (i.e., the Convergence Hypothesis argument) and another that questions the universal applicability of TQM (i.e., the National Specificity argument). We do so to provide a stronger theoretical basis for the "universality of TQM" question and to motivate and initiate a "strong inference" epistemological approach [Platt, J.R., 1964. Strong inference. Science 146 (364), 347-353] to examine, at the empirical level, the applicability of TQM across multiple countries. For this empirical assessment, we compare both the adoption levels of the Deming-based TQM constructs and the patterns of Deming-based TQM relationships among German, Italian, Japanese, and USA plants, using secondary data from 143 plants in Round Two of the World-Class Manufacturing project. After assessing measurement quality (i.e., reliability and validity) and measurement equivalence (i.e., translation, calibration, and metric), MANOVA analysis and regression analysis were deployed to derive relevant empirical results empirical results that have implications not only for the question of whether or not TQM is universal in its applicability but also for the theoretical tension between the Convergence Hypothesis argument and the National Specificity argument.

Using a knowledge-based framework, I propose that the ability to transfer knowledge and competencies across national boundaries is much easier in plants characterized by physical capital investment. Hence, during overseas entry, manufacturing firms are likely to use greenfield operations. On the other hand, in plants characterized by human capital investment, the difficulty in transferring knowledge and the need to learn and adapt to host nation requirements will make a local acquisition the preferred mode of entry by manufacturing firms. Using 682 entry decisions made by manufacturing firms during entry into the U.S., I investigate this notion while controlling for size of the industry, research intensity of the industry, degree of unionization, cultural distance, and the value of investment. Study findings indicate that in plants characterized by human capital intensity, the preferred entry mode is acquisitions over greenfield operations. However, foreign entrants with physical capital-intensive plants prefer greenfield operations over acquisitions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a typology of supply chain configurations that contributes to tie together terms that have been used disjointedly for describing various forms of supply chain. It also enables researchers to develop theories related to the identified typology, rather than continue expanding efforts on separate, unconnected studies. The typology is configurational, consistent, and based on the correspondence (Sheppard and Sherman, 1998) between Fiske's theory of relational forms (1990) and the concept of interdependence, analyzed in the context of supply chain management. Our framework encompasses four main configurations - the communicative, coordinated, collaborative, and co-opetitive - and we refer to these as the 4 C's in supply chain management. We discuss the benefits of the proposed typology from managerial and research perspectives, and suggest some research extensions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We develop a framework for identifying the types of behavioral assumptions typically made in analytical OM models. We then use this framework to organize the results of prior behavioral research and identify future research opportunities. Our study of prior research is based on a search of papers published between 1985 and 2005 in six targeted journals including the Journal of Operations Management, Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, Production and Operations Management, Management Science, Decision Sciences, and the Journal of Applied Psychology.

This construct measures the degree to which a firm sets clear service quality standards for itself on dimensions that customers care about. and has an formal policy for quickly giving meaningful compensation to customers when these standards are not met. The paper builds upon established micro-level behavioral theory to develop the "Service Guarantee Strength Framework". This framework posits that high Service Guarantee Strength leads to improved service quality, customer satisfaction, and loyalty through three intervening variables-marketing communications impact, employee motivation and vision, and learning through service failure. An empirical investigation was conducted to test the SGS Framework using both employee and customer data from three pairs of firms. with each pair in a different industry. None of these firms had an explicit service guarantee. Unlike many behavioral research studies. this study measured both employee and customer perceptual data and compared the two. The research finds that Service Guarantee Strength is positively related to customer perceptions of service quality, customer satisfaction, and loyalty. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

U.S. hospitals are renowned to be among the highest in quality, but recent studies assert that the majority of error-related deaths per year are preventable. In response, healthcare organizations have adopted quality management programs. Employee commitment and control theories propose that employee initiatives are critical to patient safety. However, little research has focused on the efficacy of employee commitment and control initiatives for quality programs at healthcare organizations. This study examines the responses from Quality and Risk Directors of 372 U.S. hospitals. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrate that perceived quantitative and qualitative quality program results are more highly related to employee commitment and control initiatives than they are related to quality practices.

However, some quality-management advocates, such as W. Edwards Deming, often criticize the use of goals. This research investigates the tension between goals and quality management in the Six Sigma context. We find empirical support that goals can be effective in Six Sigma improvement teams when teams adhere to the Six Sigma tools and method. However, challenging goals are counterproductive when Six Sigma teams do not use the tools and methods rigorously. This research reconciles the differences between quality management and goal theory by showing that the Six Sigma tools and method interact with goals. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our research objective is to isolate critical TQM practices that would enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty among maquiladora workers. On-site surveys were conducted at two leading maquiladora firms that have long implemented TQM. The statistical results indicate that employee empowerment, teamwork, and employee compensation have a significant and positive influence on employee satisfaction. The improved employee satisfaction leads to a higher level of employee loyalty. In addition, the results indicate that the effects of top management commitment on employee empowerment and teamwork are significantly mediated by employee training, implying that the success of employee empowerment and quality teams can be dependent upon the level of employee training.

There is relatively poor understanding what the implications are of increased task complexity in planning and scheduling operations. Previous work in the behavioral sciences have investigated the concept of cognitive load, addressing both task complexity and task workload or stress, and have concluded that decision makers tend to resort to routine action and reduce the variety in their actions with increasing complexity and workload. Alternatively, control theory suggests that a higher variety of actions is needed to deal with more complex problems. In this paper, we investigate the effects of task complexity in a chemical plant on the variety of actions deployed by the planners. The single work center resource structure and the availability of actual planning data from an MRP-application database allows us to both use field data and study a situation which is simple enough to measure the main effect. Our results suggest that increased task complexity without time pressure does indeed lead to increased action variety deployed by the planners. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To do so we posit a theoretical framework that integrates the heretofore distinct operational make-buy literature and the behavioral decision-making literature. Within the framework three factors influencing the make-buy decision are brought into account: the decision-maker's perception of supply risk or "strategic vulnerability", the degree of core competency represented by the product component under consideration and the formality of the information about supply alternatives. The results of a controlled experimental survey show that: strategic vulnerability and core competency do influence the make-buy decision, strategic vulnerability has greater influence than core competency and information formality moderates the make-buy decision when the strategic vulnerability and core competency conditions are mixed. The practical implications of these results include the notion that management can ensure a more rational make-buy decision if they understand the biases that influence the decision and point these biases out to the decision maker.

Using the beer distribution game in a controlled laboratory setting, we test four behavioral hypotheses - bounded rationality, experiential learning, systems learning, and organizational learning - by systematically manipulating training and communication protocols. We find that order variability decreases significantly in a setting in which participants start with hands-on experience, and are then allowed to formulate team strategies collaboratively. This result indicates that while training may improve individuals' knowledge and understanding of the system, it does not improve supply chain performance unless supply chain partners are allowed to communicate and share this knowledge. Our results indicate that the bullwhip effect is, at least in part, caused by insufficient coordination between supply chain partners. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While the creation of relational capital within an organization is a relatively well identified concept in organizational research, comparatively little research exists on the inter-organizational socialization processes that create relational value in supply chains. In our research, we extend theoretical models of group social conduits into this context, and develop a model that posits the impact of formal and informal socialization processes on the creation of relational capital between buyers and suppliers. Results from our study of I I I manufacturing organizations in the United Kingdom suggest that informal socialization processes are important in the creation of relational capital, which in turn can lead to improved supplier relationship outcomes. Formal bridging socialization conduits appear to play a lesser role in deriving these benefits. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This intuitively appealing proposition asserts that production competence leads to improved business performance. However, CSA's empirical work has been criticized by Vickery and her collaborators and by Safizadeh, Ritzman. and Mallick (SRM). Moreover, SRM's own empirical work suggested that the CSA proposition only holds for batch processes. Using data from two large studies, we avoid the problems that plagued CSXs analysis, improve on their result, and call into question the SRM finding that restricts that result to batch operations.

Replication is an important technique for researchers to embrace in order to achieve this goal. In this study, we test one of the frameworks of technology outsourcing developed in the West, by changing the cultural context. Following Kodak's historic outsourcing decision, technology outsourcing has assumed significant importance among researchers and practitioners. Most of the research in relation to technology outsourcing has been conducted in the Western culture (including the USA and the UK), so our goal in this study is to extend the understanding of technology outsourcing research conducted in the West to another culture-that of Korea, through replication. We focused on information systems (IS) outsourcing decision making as a case in point and found both similarities and dissimilarities in relation to the current understanding of the same. These similarities and differences in turn, reveal the distinctions between the Western and the Korean approaches toward achieving outsourcing success. The similarities are the partial preference for short-term contracts and contracting out to external vendors. However, the two cultures differed in their decision making in the way they pursue contractual completeness, whether in-house departments competes or not, design of contract to include partnership measures, criticality of tasks outsourced, familiarity with the outsourced task, postponing a few outsourcing decisions, and withholding a piece of a contract as bait. We also found "trust" and "task partitioning to gain advantage of varied expertise" to be important for achieving outsourcing success in the Korean organization. In addition, we observed that outsourcing success is achieved by maximizing reliability and relationship in the Korean context rather than by maximizing flexibility and control, as was observed in the Western context. We argue that this difference is a function of cultural diversity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Achieving rigid flexibility: factory focus for the 1990s. European Management Journal 11 (4), 443-447]. It investigates relationships between flexibility performance and adoption of simplicity and discipline programs in manufacturing. The research replicates the study by Collins et al. [Collins, R.S., Cordon, C., Julien, D., 1998. An empirical test of the rigid flexibility model. Journal of Operations Management 16 (2-3), 133-146] with some modifications, including the use of a broader international database, the assessment of both technology and organizational programs, and the testing of the moderating role of dedicated line layout on the relationships between simplicity, discipline and flexibility. Analysis of data from 285 manufacturers of fabricated metal products, machinery, and equipment from 14 countries indicates that simplicity and discipline related positively to performance in product customization, volume flexibility, mix flexibility, and time to market, and that some of these relationships were more positive in high volume processes than in low volume processes. The results provide empirical validation to the rigid flexibility model in an international manufacturing context. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Several research papers attribute superior firm performance to adoption of QM practices. The availability of a large number of research papers that investigate the impact of QM practices on performance provide an ideal setting for theory extension and refinement using meta-analysis techniques. In this paper a meta-analytic study is presented that fulfills two objectives. First, the paper formalizes performance implications of adopting QM practices and present hypothesized relationship between QM practices and performance. Second, a meta-analysis of correlation (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990) approach is used to examine the empirical research in QM to determine which QM practices are positively related to improved performance. The study also examines the presence of moderating factors in the association between QM practices and performance. The results support many hypothesized relationships and also point towards the presence of moderating factors in almost all QM practice-performance relationships. A discussion of the findings is presented and directions for further development of QM theory are proposed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through an empirical evaluation of over 200 U.S. manufacturers, we document the existence of four strategic manufacturing planning groups. These groups vary with respect to the degrees of "rationality" and "adaptability" of planning. In addition, the strategic manufacturing planning history and level of planning maturity differs between these groups, providing evidence that the planning process changes and evolves over time from "nonrational adaptive" mode towards a more "rational adaptive" approach. Finns between these polar extremes appear to take different paths in their movement toward a "rational adaptive" mode, with some "focusing on rationality" first and others "focusing on adaptability" first. We also show that irrespective of the firm's environment, a greater degree of "rational adaptivity" is correlated with better planning outcomes and business performance. As such, it represents a "best practice" approach to strategic manufacturing planning. Insights created by this work not only make an important contribution to the manufacturing strategy literature, but can also be used by senior manufacturing managers to facilitate their progress towards more effective planning.

Lean manufacturing and agile manufacturing paradigms have also received considerable attention in operations management literature. However, paradoxically, the extant literature is lacking in clarity and fails to delineate with sufficient precision how and why leanness and agility differ. Given the resource constraints within which most manufacturing firms have to operate today, it is useful, if not critical, to develop a good understanding of how these paradigms differ and what their constituent dimensions are. Such an understanding is also essential for developing and testing theories relating to leanness and agility. Through a literature review we discuss leanness and agility in two ways: (1) as manufacturing paradigms and (2) as performance capabilities. Our empirical study attempts to determine whether lean and agile forms occur with any degree of regularity in manufacturing plants. The results confirm the existence of homogeneous groups that resemble lean and agile performing plants, and they identify important differences pertaining to their constituent performance dimensions. The results indicate that while the pursuit of agility might presume leanness, pursuit of leanness might not presume agility. While the perfonnance capability differences across the empirically derived groups accord well with expected differences across plants that excel in leanness and agility, the practice differences across the groups are not as clearly distinguished. We discuss the implications of our findings for further research and theory development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Building on the resource-based view, strategic choice theory, and configurational research, we suggest that the relative fit among strategy and eight knowledge elements is a key to achieving superior supply chain performance. Using data from 913 entities in supply chains, we conducted a profile deviation analysis by using ideal "knowledge profiles" for five strategy types as the benchmarks. Separate analyses were conducted based on the ideal profiles derived from qualitative, quantitative, and theoretical inputs. Overall, the results indicate that the strategy-knowledge fit is associated with chain performance. Our findings lend support to the notion that capitalizing on knowledge can create superior performance in supply chains, but only if the relative emphasis on various knowledge elements matches strategy.

It has also been shown that flexibility can be utilized proactively to create a competitive advantage for a company. Despite the recognition that it serves a dual purpose, little work has been done to synthesize these competing uses of flexibility. This study proposes a model that not only articulates an effective use of flexibility concurrently for both proactive and reactive purposes, it also allows a simultaneous view of the opportunities and uncertainties along the value-chain. By embracing the entire value-chain, this model considers the implications of the inter-relating feedback loops within the supply-chain, which to-date has been overlooked in the flexibility literature. Such an approach provides managers with a tool that allows them to consider more options in configuring flexibility between its two competing uses. Within the model, eleven dimensions of flexibility are identified and then classified into three levels comprising a transformation process. This model is grounded in observations from a field study of 10 printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication companies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this environment, the performance of the product development process and the impact of product design on costs are critical factors for organizational success. To respond, firms are adding resources such as computer-aided design (CAD) to enhance product development efforts. The use of CAD technology is expected to enhance product development performance (development time, product quality, and design productivity) and to reduce product and manufacturing costs. To investigate these relationships, data were collected from 175 manufacturing firms regarding CAD usage, product development performance, and cost performance. From these data, valid and reliable instruments were developed to measure CAD usage. Structural model tests indicated that CAD usage has a positive impact on product development performance and cost performance. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

From the model emerge hypotheses that are tested using the structural equation modeling approach, taking into account differences in challenges across small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large to very large firms.

A review of the literature addressing such systems indicates that existing research is almost exclusively focused on higher level planning issues such as facility location and resource allocation. In contrast, this study addresses the operational level of such a system, an existing fire department's response to residential structure fire. Such a response exhibits many of the elements of traditional project management, such as distinctly defined tasks and significant predecessor relationships. However, the defining characteristic of these projects is not simply expediency, but the fact that the structure of the project can change if the preceding project structure does not complete some aspect of its task sequence within an interval of time dictated by some external pacing function. What emerges is a unique and intriguing class of project, dubbed the hyper-project in this study. The concept of the hyper-project is discussed both in its general form and with respect to the aforementioned case study example. Readily transferable to nonemergency applications, the hyper-project typifies and unites a heretofore unrecognized family of operations, highlighting the opportunities for future research.

Data from 137 completed NPD projects are analyzed for evidence pointing to tradeoffs in performance patterns manifested in the data. In addition, we investigate hypothesized relationships between certain NPD practices and a holistic, efficiency based measure of NPD performance. We demonstrate a new approach to the operationalization of holistic new product development (NPD) project performance, employing a sequential data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology that simultaneously incorporates multiple factors including new product development cost, product cost, product quality, and project lead time. The results of the data analysis support our hypothesis that tradeoffs among NPD performance outcomes are manifested more strongly in highly efficient projects when compared to inefficient projects. The presence of three distinct subgroups in highly efficient projects is suggestive of several modes of efficiency which appear to achieve equally effective market success. The absence of such patterns in less efficient projects supports a theory of performance frontiers that may impose the need for tradeoffs more strongly as NPD projects achieve higher levels of efficiency. The findings also point to the importance of project management experience, balanced management commitment, and cross-functional integration in achieving high levels of NPD project efficiency. We discuss the implications of the findings for practice and for future research. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We operationalize supplier integration as a bundle of practices that include a set of "internal" and "external" practices. We hypothesize that such practices in specific configurations can be as important a source of performance differentials as the adoption of individual practices themselves. We theorize the existence of a level of integration that results in optimal performance. The paper uses data from a cross-section of more than 300 US manufacturing companies to test the notion of an optimal level of supplier integration, and examine the conditions surrounding its development. The results provide empirical support for the concept of an optimal set of supplier integration practices. We show that deviations from the optimal profile are associated with performance deterioration, and that indiscriminate and continued investments in integration may not yield commensurate improvements in performance.

Some countries have adopted both the MBNQA criteria and weights, while others have adapted the criteria categories or weights somewhat. The relevance of this conceptual framework across national cultures has yet to be established, despite its use as the foundation for numerous national quality awards. This study uses Hofstede's dimensions of national culture to examine whether the theoretical constructs underlying the Baldrige criteria are relevant across national cultures. Correlation analysis, stepwise regression and analysis of variance are used to analyze hypotheses in manufacturing plants in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Italy and England. There were many interactions between dimensions of national culture and the Baldrige constructs advanced in this study. The findings indicate that national culture plays a strong role in the effectiveness of the Baldrige constructs, with the exception of customer and market focus. The findings are interpreted in light of the need for countries to develop awards and quality initiatives tailored to their national cultures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is believed that the implementation of these concepts enhances inter-firm relationships. Furthermore, as firms move towards closer and more integrated supply chains it is argued that socialization is an increasingly important mechanism in facilitating and enhancing the supply integration process. This paper has taken these activities and embedded them in the theory of 'socialization' and supply chain integration. The authors propose and test a model on how buyers can use the concepts of supply chain integration and socialization to achieve improved supplier communication and operational performance, and therefore, to improve the buyer's perceived level of the supplier's contractual conformance. The findings reveal that socialization is essential for the development of any significant business relationship and the enhancement of a supply integration strategy.

However, taxonomic studies in the operations strategy literature are scarce. Major studies that use North American or European data to develop taxonomies of manufacturing strategies contend that the applicability of their identified taxonomies to other countries remains unclear. Furthermore, the construction of theory is not complete without regular verification and replication to account for competitive paradigm shifts and new environmental imperatives. In our study, we replicated the well-acknowledged taxonomy of manufacturing strategies of [Miller, J.G., Roth, A.V., 1994. A taxonomy of manufacturing strategies, Management Science 40 (3), 285-304] using data from one of the world's fastest growing economies-China. A taxonomy of manufacturing strategies is identified and is found to be different from the strategic clusters of Caretakers, Marketeers and Innovators in Miller and Roth. The underlying dimensions that defined our clusters are also different from those in Miller and Roth. Our study also derived an interesting insight that a taxonomy that is based on realized strength rather than emphasis on competitive capabilities can better explain a company's financial performance.

The buying company, referred to as the focal company, manages the suppliers in the supply base through contracts and purchasing of parts, materials, and services. To facilitate better management of a supply base, we observe "complexity" as a key area of managerial consideration and apply the literature on complexity to the supply base. Supply base complexity is conceptualized in three dimensions: (1) the number of suppliers in the supply base, (2) the degree of differentiation among these suppliers, and (3) the level of inter-relationships among the suppliers. Four propositions have been formulated in terms of four major areas of research within supply chain management-transaction costs, supply risk, supplier responsiveness, and supplier innovation. Corollary propositions are also stated. Although a reduction in complexity may lead to lower transaction costs and increased supplier responsiveness, in certain circumstances it may also increase supply risk and reduce supplier innovation. Therefore, reducing supply base complexity in general may be a cost-efficient approach, but blindly reducing it may potentially decrease the buying company's overall competitiveness.

These omissions in the extant literature include a lack of focus upon the factors affecting the performance outcomes of international sourcing. This article examines the antecedents of the supply management performance of international buyer-supplier relationships. It does so from the perspective of the buying organization. The authors develop an integrative framework based on game theory and exchange theory, and linked with the resource dependence approach and transaction cost theory. Specifically, the relationships between four constructs are examined: the multi-dimensional construct of uncertainty, the game-theoretical construct of the shadow of the future, the exchange-theoretical construct of social bonding, and supply management performance. Based on large-scale surveys with supply managers, the framework is tested in a cross-national study in the U.S. and in Germany. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been shown that technology implementation places a strong demand on nurse staff competency. While new strategic information systems are emerging, hospitals must provide on-the-job technological training for their nursing staffs. Of course, technology is not a cure-all; rather, it is a tool that can be used by skilled nurse professionals in transforming sick patients into well patients with reasonable efficiency. The causal relationships between technology, nurse management decisions and performance established in this study are an important addition to the healthcare services literature. The results of our study also show that given the size constraint, large hospitals tend to invest more in equipment and technology for providing technology related services as compared to smaller hospitals. On the other hand, small rural hospitals tend to place more emphasis on staff development than their counterparts in urban areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Organizations seeking to implement these changes should have an internal environment that emphasizes knowledge assimilation and sharing and creates continuous learning capability, i.e., absorptive capacity. This study reviews the construct of absorptive capacity, develops a valid and reliable instrument to measure it, and examines its impact on the organization's ability to assimilate innovative manufacturing technology and management practice. To illustrate the links, this study tests the relationships among absorptive capacity, time-based manufacturing practices, and value to customer. Structural equation modeling, applied to a relatively large sample (n = 303), indicates strong, positive, and direct relationships between absorptive capacity and time-based manufacturing practices, and between time-based manufacturing practices and value to customer.

Prior research on multistage services has analyzed each process stage independently or in an additive manner. Increased emphasis on Six Sigma initiatives in services has rekindled interest in the use of control charts to monitor and control service processes. This study examines the cause selecting control chart as a methodology to monitor and identify potential problem areas in an actual cascade service process and compares the diagnostic capability of the cause selecting chart to that of a traditional Shewhart chart. A grocery store whose parent company was implementing efficient consumer response (ECR) serves as the research context. This study models the grocery store as a two-stage cascade process and uses operating data from the store to construct a cause selecting chart and a traditional Shewhart chart for the front-end operation. Analysis of the two charts reveals that the cause selecting chart outperforms the traditional control chart as tool for signaling unusual variation in performance at the front-end stage. The analysis demonstrates that service managers can receive misleading or erroneous information from traditional control charts if the service process being monitored is a cascade process.

This paper applies operations management analytical techniques to the non-profit performing arts to increase understanding of operational issues and inform service management strategy. The paper takes a two-study idiographic approach. Implementing a modified version of service transaction analysis (STA), Study One describes a performing arts service from provider and customer perspectives, identifies service gaps and develops an elaborated service description incorporating both perspectives. In Study Two, building on the elaborated service description and extant research, in-depth interviews are conducted to gather thick descriptions of predictors of satisfaction, value and service quality as they relate to repurchase intention (RI). Technical, functional and critical factors required to improve organizational performance are identified. Implications for operational strategy, service design and service management theory for this context are discussed. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Having experienced a similar growth in the demand for delivered items, the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) commissioned a study to improve its delivery operations. Using operations management concepts, such as pre-sorting of material to avoid double handling, cross docking to reduce cycle time of delivery, and workload balancing among delivery routes to effectively increase delivery capacity, the delivery operations were restructured. We developed optimization models for library delivery operations that specifically accounted for pre-sorting, cross docking and route balancing. We also developed heuristics for solving these models and implemented them to redesign the delivery operations at SFPL. The redesigned delivery operations will reduce the cycle time and the cost of delivery by almost half. Furthermore, through balanced utilization of existing truck capacities, the delivery operations will be able to handle significantly larger delivery volume and thereby accommodate future delivery service growth without additional investments. The operations management concepts and techniques illustrated in this paper through the example of SFPL should prove to be useful to other urban, multi-branch library systems as they deal with their delivery challenges.

Service Plus: Effective Service Management, G. Morin Publisher, Quebec]. In this paper, we argue that the mechanism that permits or enables simultaneous success on these dimensions in public sector operations is information technology applied in conjunction with a unified set of service operations concepts. To demonstrate this contention, we employ an adaptation of the Goldstein et al. [Goldstein, S.M., Johnston, R., Duffy, J., Rao, J., 2002. The service concept: the missing link in service design research? Journal of Operations Management 20 (2), 121-134] service planning design framework, taking issue with some interpretative aspects of their strategic model. The modified planning framework was applied to an initiative in South Carolina state government to improve operations and technology deployment at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The detailed and ongoing case study illustrates the utility of a broad service-based, IT-enabled approach to designing a government service, while simultaneously demonstrating that operational service alignment is the key to avoiding results that have long been labeled a dilemma in the public sector.

In not-for-profit, public, and government services, it is common for labor to include unpaid volunteers. This article demonstrates how the volunteer labor assignment (VLA) problem is markedly different from traditional labor assignment (TLA) problems such as labor scheduling. One core difference pertains to the cost structure of labor, where TLA problems seek to minimize labor costs, yet labor costs for volunteers are usually trivial. Another difference is the assumed size of the labor pool: TLA typically assumes sufficient labor to cover task requirements, whereas the VLA labor pool is limited by the number of volunteers that can be recruited. These and other distinctions coming from the volunteerism literature are described and confirmed with empirical data. One important finding is that volunteers who were not utilized had a reduced propensity to volunteer in the future. These VLA distinctions are incorporated into an integer goal program. Empirical data are used to demonstrate how VLA assumptions produce solutions that are significantly different from solutions coming from TLA assumptions. Sensitivity analysis is described, as are applications in other VLA contexts. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two decision-making roles are studied: executives, those with the authority to start or cancel a project, and project managers, those who direct the day-to-day operations of the project. Our exploratory survey research, an initial step in this topic, suggests that different roles cluster critical termination factors uniquely and use different decision weighting levels on these factors. On a second construct, information gathering actions, such as scanning and interpretation, show an indication of bias, particularly sunk cost bias, and this bias is experienced differently by executives and project managers. Interestingly, the scale of a project, in terms of labor-hours, calendar time, or budget, does not appear to be related to perception of 'failure'. The implications for the management of government safety projects are that care must be taken to understand the differing viewpoints of the two types of decision-makers and that the initial presentation of information concerning a project may influence the perception of a project's outcome. While there are several implications for operations management research, the most critical is that care must be given when surveying "managers" concerning subjective measures of 'success' or 'failure' as there can be radical perceptual differences by role.

The application of lead-time reduction theory to the not-for-profit operations context, however, has been limited. We present an illustrative case study of a not-for-profit operation in which long lead times cause a substantial increase in unnecessary deaths from tuberculosis and hinder the efforts of the World Health Organization to eradicate tuberculosis globally. The case study suggests that lead-time reduction theory may be as effective in not-for-profit (service) operations as it has been in manufacturing operations. Our results also illustrate how use of sophisticated but "user-friendly" queuing theory-based modeling tools can facilitate the acceptance and transfer of operations logic to a not-for-profit intergovernmental organization setting.

The problem considered is that of finding the best bottling alternative for produced batches when these have to undergo several lengthy quality tests related to the foregoing production processes. Produced batches can be bottled directly after production when the results of these test are completely unknown, after some positive (intermediate) test results are known, or after all test have been completed with positive results. When waiting in order to be bottled, a batch has to stay in the production tank. Alternatives that start the bottling process quickly after production have the advantages of a relatively low tank capacity requirement and of a relatively small flow time if all test results are positive. However, a produced batch can only be reworked as long as it has not been bottled. So fast bottling reduces the possibilities for rework and therefore reduces the production yield. We present performance measures for comparing the different alternatives and derive closed form expressions for them. We also present the results obtained for the considered case.

When setting up a production schedule, planners must consider the effects of off-grade production and production rate penalties, which are typically sequence-dependent as products are transitioned from one to another, as well as inventory holding costs and capacity constraints. We call this the continuous economic lot sizing and scheduling problem (CELSP) to distinguish it from closely related problems found in discrete part production industries. We present a formulation that addresses the particular aspects of the CELSP and apply the proposed mathematical modeling approach to several plants of a chemical processing company. This company was concerned with ensuring the plants were carrying proper amounts of inventory and with evaluating the number of products produced at each plant. Our results show actual overall inventory levels were close to the levels suggested by our model and therefore company plans for further inventory reductions would not be appropriate. However, the company should carefully consider the addition of new products to current plant product slates. Due to the effects of product transitions and inventory levels, even adding products with significant contribution margins may negatively affect the financial performance of the plant.

Is focus-or unfocus-a strategic choice, best practice or perhaps a reflection of an environmental constraint? In his pioneering work, Skinner [W. Skinner, 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Business Review 52 (3) 113-121] prescribes companies to ensure that the manufacturing task of their manufacturing units is simple and focused, for instance, by assigning a narrow product mix for each factory or concentrating on a narrow mix of production technologies. Especially in the absence of compelling empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the focused factory approach, we argue that we still do not understand why some plants may remain unfocused. We observe that in the international process industry case examined in this paper, some factories are unfocused and their manufacturing tasks are all but simple. Yet, some of them appear to be high performers. This presents an opportunity to seek empirical insight on the questions raised above. Specifically, we examine why manufacturing companies in the process industries may or may not follow the focused factory strategy. Our results suggest that in certain operating environments and with certain competitive strategies, choosing not to focus the manufacturing task should be viewed as a viable alternative manufacturing strategy, perhaps even a constraint imposed by the operating environment. We develop four contingency propositions to explain why focused manufacturing strategy may not be desirable or even possible. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This exploratory study investigates re-use issues and practices related to process industry firms-from the producer's perspective-with the objective of identifying important issues that need further research in the field. Site visits were conducted to identify and clarify re-use issues unique to process industry firms for the purpose of developing a mail survey instrument. The mail survey provided detailed information about the sources of returned product and materials and the subsequent re-use decisions made by 141 different manufacturing facilities in a wide variety of process industries including chemicals, food, rubber, and plastics. Results indicate that process industry firms are quite diverse, that some common beliefs about re-use in process industry firms do not apply to all process types in these industries, and that research efforts are needed in the areas of network design and product acquisition; inventory; production planning and control; and scheduling. The paper concludes by identifying specific research questions important to re-use in process industry environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the basis of case studies, we state that flexibility is not only restrained by hard-wired production process characteristics, but also by organizational procedures in the planning process. Planning practice in food processing industries is often not able to make the most of the available flexibility in the production processes, and our analysis shows that existing production planning approaches, ERP systems, and advanced planning systems can only partly resolve this. We propose a planning framework that can help to analyze the flexibility of the planning. The planning framework relates planning events to the way in which planning decisions are structured in the planning organization. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More than 20 years after the arrival of lean production, this question remains unresolved. Generally accepted models of job design such as the Job Characteristics Model (JCM, (Hackman, J.R., Oldham, G.R. 1976. Motivation through the design of work: test of a theory. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance 16, 250-279.)) cannot explain the occurrence of worker intrinsic motivation in the context of lean production. In this paper, we extend the JCM to the lean production context to explain the theoretical relationship between job characteristics and motivational outcomes in lean production. We suggest that a configuration of lean production practices is more important for worker intrinsic motivation than are independent main effects, and that motivation may be limited by excessive leanness. We conclude that lean production job design may engender worker intrinsic motivation; however, there are likely to be substantial differences in intrinsic motivation under differing lean production configurations.

This industry has been growing for the past 5 years at greater than 25% per year while the overall market for foodstuffs has been largely stagnant. The research utilizes data from surveys of over 2100 customers of five different home delivery grocers. The analysis utilizes two group variables (customer experience level and order picking method) and five primary constructs (service quality, product quality, product freshness, time-savings and behavioral intentions). The results indicate that customer perceptions of the primary constructs generally improve as they gain experience with this new method of ordering and receiving groceries. Furthermore, the operational choice of picking method is also shown to have a large impact on customer perceptions-in particular, more experienced customers generally rate the primary constructs higher for distribution center (DC)-based picking than for store-based picking. The study provides support for the hypothesis that direct to customer foodstuffs can be of better freshness and quality when picked from a DC because of the ability to shorten the supply chain than from a store. The data suggest that a DC-based picking strategy is viable if grocers can re-shape customer perceptions and master the numerous intricacies of the supply chain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

While the beneficial impact of supply chain agility is generally acknowledged, very little research exists to date addressing how an organization can achieve supply chain agility. This study first presents a framework of an organization's supply chain process flexibilities as an important antecedent of its supply chain agility, and then establishes the key factors that determine the flexibility attributes of the three critical processes of the supply chain-procurement/sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution/logistics. Using empirical data, we develop flexibility and agility scales related to our supply chain agility model, and then test the model. Findings reveal that supply chain agility of a firm is directly and positively impacted by the degree of flexibility present in the manufacturing and procurement/sourcing processes of the supply chain; while it is indirectly impacted by the level of flexibility within its distribution/logistics process. The results also support our view that a firm's supply chain agility is impacted by the synergy among the three process flexibilities in its internal supply chain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

Although the advantages of close co-operation are widely acknowledged in the literature, the specific attributes of such relationships are not well understood. To address this gap, 39 managers responsible for purchasing were interviewed using a technique from psychology, which is particularly effective at uncovering the characteristics of relationships. This approach is innovative in the context of supplier management research and gave insights into how manufacturers expect more from their suppliers than just reliable deliveries of high-quality, well-priced parts and components. The results of the empirical research enhance our knowledge of the attributes of manufacturer-supplier relationships and also indicate how manufacturers can establish close relationships with selected suppliers. Overall, the study has established the viability of a new approach for understanding the complex topic of manufacturer-supplier partnerships. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

In doing so, the focus on environmental management and operations is moved from local optimization of environmental factors to consideration of the entire supply chain during the production, consumption, customer service and post-disposal disposition of products. This is a critical and timely topic that captures increasing concerns over sustainability, whether driven by current legislation, public interest, or competitive opportunity. As such, sustainable development is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has the potential to affect future government policy, current production operations, and identify new business models.

A key challenge in this role is to balance the often conflicting pressures created by sustainable development-firm-level economic performance versus environmental degradation and social disruption. Drawing on complexity theory, risk management, stakeholder theory and the innovation dynamics literature, we discuss the problems of integrating sustainable development concerns in the supply chain, specifically the applicability of life cycle assessment (LCA). Many authors have emphasized the importance of the "cradle to grave" approach of LCA in optimizing closed-loop supply chains, improving product design and stewardship. Based on two case studies (an agricultural biotechnology and an oil and gas company) with supporting data collected from key stakeholders, we argue that sustainable development pressures have increased complexities and presented ambiguous challenges that many current environmental management techniques cannot adequately address. We provide a framework that addresses these deficiencies and discuss implications for practitioners and management theory. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These regulations significantly influence the distribution process of retail chain organizations. This paper studies the impact of governmental time-window pressure on retailers' logistical concepts and the consequential financial and environmental distribution performance. We determine which dimensions in the retailer's logistical concept determine its cost and emission sensitivity to increasing time-window pressure. Our research is based on a multiple case study of fourteen Dutch retail cases in different sectors and with different store formulas. The retailers provided all organizational, flow and cost data of their secondary distribution (between distribution center and stores). We use these data to calculate the impacts of different time-window pressure scenarios, including the current situation, using vehicle routing software. It appears that cost and emissions increases are moderate, when few cities are affected. However, as more cities are affected, costs and emissions increase considerably, particularly if time-window lengths become shorter. Time-windows harmonized between cities lead to fewer negative effects. We find various dimensions that contribute to reducing a retailer's sensitivity to time-window pressure. We formulate conclusions hypothesizing the links between time-window pressure, its effects, and the dimensions that determine these effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Take-back laws require that firms take responsibility for the collection/disposal costs of their products. We consider two alternative implementations of take-back laws that are distinguished by the degree of control that the manufacturer has on returns sold to the remanufacturer. In one implementation, known as collective WEEE take-back, the manufacturer has no control over returns sold to the remanufacturer. The other implementation, known as individual WEEE take-back, gives complete control to the manufacturer. We develop a general two-period model to investigate questions of interest to policy-makers in government and managers in industry. Our results suggest that, in some settings, enactment of collective WEEE take-back will result in higher manufacturer and remanufacturer profits while simultaneously spurring remanufacturing activity and reducing the tax burden on society. A negative effect is higher consumer prices in the market. In other settings, we find that collective WEEE take-back introduces a structural change to the industry-creating an environment where remanufacturing becomes profitable when it is not profitable without a take-back law. With respect to individual WEEE take-back, we find that the manufacturer often benefits from allowing the remanufacturer to enter the market, though from a government policy-maker perspective, there are clear risks of monopolistic behavior.

The RSC can potentially reduce negative environmental impacts of extracting virgin raw materials and waste disposal. If so, investment in the reverse supply chain should not be made in isolation, but instead must be integrated with investments selected to improve the forward supply chain. After defining and operationalizing these constructs, a survey of plant managers was used to empirically assess the linkages between supply chain investments, organizational risk propensity (i.e., willingness to take risk) and business uncertainty. Reverse supply chain investment had two primary dimensions: reconditioning (i.e., high-value recovery) and recycling and waste management (i.e., low-or no-value recovery). Ongoing investment in the forward supply chain was significantly related to investment in recycling and waste management, but not to investment in reconditioning. Moreover, risk propensity was found to mediate the relationship between the external business uncertainty and investment in the forward and reverse supply chain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a durable end-of-life product from which a particular part can be dismantled and remanufactured, and the remainder of the product can be further processed for part and/or material recovery. Both the quantity of end-of-life products available and the demand for remanufactured parts are price-sensitive. We develop models to determine the optimal acquisition price of the end-of-life products and the selling price of the remanufactured parts in centralized as well as remanufacturer- and collector-driven decentralized channels. We discuss how the decentralized channels can be coordinated to attain the end-of-life product collection rate that can be achieved in the centralized channel. In the presence of environmental regulations that require an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of durable goods to collect and process its end-of-life products, we identify when and why the OEM would prefer a remanufacturer- or a collector-driven channel, i.e., outsource the processing or the collection activity, respectively. From a practical perspective, we show that the OEM should prefer a collector-driven channel to increase the collection rate, when end-of-life products are homogenous. However, we also show that the OEM would prefer a remanufacturer-driven channel under certain conditions. We also examine how the OEM can increase the quantity of used products collected, when the collection rate in the preferred channel setting falls short of the collection rate mandated by the environmental regulation. When end-of-life products are heterogeneous, we observe that the collection rate for all quality groups can be positive in a remanufacturer-driven channel, whereas the collection rate for some quality groups may be zero. This indicates that the OEM must pay more attention to its outsourcing decision in this case, if the environmental regulation in effect specifies target collection rates for individual quality groups.

To competitively exploit these products, one option is to incorporate used components in "new" or remanufactured products. However, this option is partly limited by a firm's ability to assess the reliability of used components. A comprehensive two-step approach is proposed. The first stage phase statistically analyzes the behavior of components for reuse. A well-known reliability assessment method, the Weibull analysis, is applied to the time-to-failure data to assess the mean life of components. In the second phase, the degradation and condition monitoring data are analyzed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches employing multiple regression analysis are highlighted with empirical data from a consumer product. Finally, the Weibull analysis and the ANN model are then integrated to assess the remaining useful life of components for reuse. This is a critical advance in sustainable management of supply chains since it allows for a better understanding of not only service requirements of product, but the remaining life in a product and hence its suitability for reuse or remanufacture. Future work should assess: (1) reduction in downtime of process equipment through the implementation of this technique as a means to better manage preventative maintenance; (2) reduce field failure of remanufactured product; (3) selling-service strategy through implementation of the proposed methodology.

We hypothesize that while there may be no direct benefit of eBusiness technologies on performance, these technologies might support customer integration and supplier integration in the supply chain, which in turn might impact operating performance. To examine our hypotheses, we collected data from respondents who focused their responses to a single major product the process that manufactures it, a significant customer, and an important supplier. Our analyses showed that there was no direct benefit of eBusiness technologies on performance; however these technologies supported customer integration and supplier integration. Further, supplier integration was found to positively impact cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery performance; however there was no relationship between customer integration and performance. Consequently, there is a relationship between eBusiness technologies and supplier integration that leads to better performance. Further, there is an interactive effect between customer integration and supplier integration that supports the notion that firms that have both forms of integration, supported by eBusiness technologies, significantly outperform the others.

It is assumed that if companies across supply chains have visibility of demand, inventory levels, processes, etc., that organizational performance improves. This research explores the antecedents of high levels of supply chain visibility from a resource-based theory perspective across five different external supply chain linkages. We find that the level of visibility across these linkages differs considerably based on various contributing factors which are both technology and non-technology based. Using resource-based theory, we identify those factors that can give a sustainable competitive advantage to a supply chain linkage through a "distinctive" or high level of visibility.

However, adoption of eBusiness in supply chains has been slower than expected, particularly in small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper reports findings of a longitudinal study of four supply chains in different sectors over a 4-year period. Specifically it examines the barriers to adoption of eBusiness technologies and therefore to achievement of integrated information in supply chains. Differences between firms in supply chains and between supply chains are examined. The study reveals disparity between existing and planned use of eBusiness by larger downstream firms compared to upstream SMEs. The SMEs are cautious, only planning to invest in eBusiness if dominant downstream customers force them; however, they do not appreciate the full benefits to be gained from eBusiness adoption. The downstream larger businesses are forging ahead with eBusiness in 'eIsolation' and are not providing supply chain leadership. They are creating eLands with SMEs adrift of them.

Using a combination of case studies and survey data from a diverse sample of industries, the research examines how industry context, firm characteristics and firm-level strategic resources, such as purchasing teams, influence the exploitation of e-business technologies and the relationship between e-business technology use and firm performance. Based on a synthesis of related literatures from transaction cost economics and the relational view of the supply chain, a two-dimensional framework for e-business technology is proposed with transactional and relational dimensions. However, empirical analysis indicated that transactional technologies can be further subdivided into two factors: dyadic cooperation and price determination. Significant differences were found between the two dimensions in terms of their overall levels of adoption, with dyadic coordination being the most widely adopted. In addition, the development of strategic resources expanded, in particular internal and customer teams, the use of e-business technologies expanded. Purchasing organizational structure and firm size also were positively related to the adoption of transactional e-business technologies. Finally, of particular importance to practitioners, e-business technologies targeted at reducing dyadic coordination costs lead to improved financial performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this work is to investigate the network organization level of supply chains in case of remote maintenance application and to understand how maintenance policies are coupled with information technology (IT) solutions. To this purpose two literature reviews are presented: firstly, on the supply chain and network integration, and then on the evolution of maintenance using information technology. Following this, the paper present four specific industrial case-studies of eMRO network organisation. They have been chosen as reference models from a set of practical applications and pilot tests performed by the authors in different production sectors in the last 5 years. Technology complexity environments, maintenance outsourcing level, and supply chain integration context are discussed for each case-studies with particular regards to the profitable forms of collaboration provided by the introduction of IT and the Web. This analysis work toward the development of a framework useful to: (1) classify different e-maintenance systems and understand the relationships between the different members of the network, and (2) identify the variables which can influence the introduction and development of the systems.

The relationships proposed and tested in the model are justified and explained based on a number of theoretical perspectives. These include Transaction Cost Economics, Socio-technical Systems, Resource Dependency, Knowledge Based View, Stakeholder Theory and Organizational Learning. The implications of the findings for Transaction Cost Theory are noteworthy firstly because they support the appropriateness of the inter-organizational governance structure in the context of this study, and secondly because although application of these technologies may reduce information search and related costs, whether this necessarily leads to reduced coordination costs is problematic. The potential benefits from improved coordination may be constrained by the perceived costs, and risks, of transition to new structural forms. The implication for practice is that increased use of Internet technologies creates substantial pressure to invest in organizational change. The attractiveness of investing in technologies that place managers in a position where they need to promote organizational change in order to extract adequate returns creates a significant dilemma. On the one hand Internet technologies enable extensive sharing and integration of data among trading partners, but at the same time they create conditions requiring managers to embrace fundamental organizational change in order to leverage the potential of such integration.

But little is known about the infrastructural competencies required for manufacturers engaged in Internet-enabled activities with downstream business customers. This paper aims to take a first step in operationalizing a set of new, multi-item measures that tap into infrastructural (or "soft") competencies required for leveraging B2B commerce. We use a structured, two-stage approach to develop and refine a set of constructs, items, and new multi-item measurement scales in order to rigorously evaluate their measurement properties. By drawing upon the literature as well as extensive interviews with expert practitioners, we define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies - termed B2B seller competence (B2B-SC) associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. We find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) change disposition, (3) conflict management, (4) market acuity, (5) coordinated logistics, (6) knowledge channels, and (7) fluid partnering. Operational indicators that tap into constructs pertaining to each B2B-SC dimension are developed through an iterative process. In the second stage, we conduct a field study to more fully assess the measurement properties of item and scale reliability and validity using a covariance structure framework. The results indicate that our new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them useful for theory building, testing, and the refinement of supply chain strategy paradigms in the emerging area of B2B commerce.

Organizational collaboration, the foundation of supply chain management, has been enabled by the development and use of e-business technologies. Organizational collaboration and information sharing, in turn, are expected to improve organizational performance. We propose and test a model of the relationship between organizational use of e-business technologies, organizational collaboration, and performance, using empirical data. Our model differs from past studies in that collaboration is viewed as two unique constructs, differentiating between intra- and inter-organizational collaboration. Our findings show that use of e-business technologies impacts performance both directly and indirectly by promoting both measures of collaboration. Intra-firm collaboration is also found to have a direct impact on organizational performance. However, the impact of inter-organizational collaboration on performance is found to be only indirect, through the impact of intra-organizational collaboration. These findings reveal the complexity of organizational collaboration, underscore the importance for companies to promote internal collaboration, and invest in information technologies that facilitate it.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the integration of information sharing and supply chain practice in supply chain management. Data from 125 North American manufacturing firms were collected. The results show that (1) effective information sharing significantly enhances effective supply chain practice; (2) supply chain dynamism has significant positive influence on effective information sharing as well as effective supply chain practice. Supply chain dynamism has more influence on information sharing than supply chain practice; (3) and effective supply chain practice becomes more important when the level of information sharing increases. The findings show that both effective information sharing and effective supply chain practice are critical in achieving good supply chain performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research examines supply chain management relationships between service providers and clients, focusing on the performance impacts of (1) the level of customization implemented by clients using vendor provided eBusiness solutions and (2) the subsequent real time access achieved with respect to operational information maintained by vendors. The study also focuses on the impacts of the provider's information exchange behavior and both parties' level of trust. Using dyadic data collected from a logistics services provider and 91 clients, findings show that the level of customization and real time information access has a direct positive impact on performance outcomes realized by both. Additionally, results demonstrate that provider's level of trust in the client positively influences their information exchange behavior, and in turn, information exchange behavior positively impacts client customizations.

The two dominant empirical methodologies in operations management are the survey and the case study. Reliance on a limited number of methodologies can influence the body of knowledge that that a field generates - and even the problems that the field collectively chooses to investigate or not investigate. The special issue attempts to "push the envelope" in terms of the data sources used in operations management. In particular, the following data sources are used: laboratory study, customer comment data, third-party web site quality ratings, process characteristics collected from e-commerce web sites themselves, environmental performance reports, and a publicly available research database. Researchers contemplating their data gathering strategy must consider the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Many researchers have studied how perceptions of e-service quality dimensions relate to perceptions of higher order evaluations such as overall satisfaction and customer loyalty. However, in this study, we turn toward operational practice, examining relationships between e-service process attributes and e-service quality dimensions. Our intent is to identify potential drivers of e-service quality that managers may use as levers to improve their operations. The study employs a cross-sectional regression analysis of publicly available data collected from an online rating site. The study sample consists of over 1000 online retailers from several retailing industry segments. The data collection and analysis are innovative due to the lack of operations management research utilizing public data sources and the increased generalizability of results obtainable from multi-sector data sets. The results identify operational drivers associated with customer ratings of e-service quality, and provide guidance for future research on drivers of e-service quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For product purchases through traditional channels, customers are known to have expectations for the product they are buying as well as for the services associated with its purchase. Online transactions, in which the buyer has no prior knowledge of the seller, are becoming increasingly common and are fraught with risks not present in traditional channels. Feedback about sellers in these risky markets contains a mix of product-related and service-related comments. This exploratory study identifies preliminary relationships between customers' emphases on product or service dimensions of quality in their feedback and the risks to which the customer is exposed.

While an insightful body of knowledge - based primarily on studies at the process-level exists on the management of capacity and inventory, the dynamism characterizing most operating and competitive systems poses an ongoing challenge for managers having to mitigate the impact of variability across different levels of operating systems (e.g., production processes, facilities, and supply chains). This paper builds on a conceptual framework, derived from queuing theory and termed the "process management triangle", to explore the extent to which fundamental trade-offs between capacity utilization, variability and inventory (CVI) generalize to complex operations and business systems. To do so, empirical analyses utilizing comparatively unique data for the study of these process management issues - and collected from two distinct, vastly different levels of analysis - are presented. First, a simulation-based facility-level analysis using teaching case study data is presented. Second, an industry-level analysis employing archival economic data spanning three multi-year periods is considered. Collectively, these empirical analyses provide exploratory support for the generalization and extension of analytical insights on CVI trade-offs to both complex operations and business systems, although with decreasing explanatory power. The implications of these studies for furthering process management theory and understanding are framed around additional research propositions intended to guide future investigation of CVI trade-offs.

However, recent quasi-experimental and field research has suggested that the use of this sourcing technique can create perceptions of opportunism among participating suppliers. Yet from the buyer's perspective, online reverse auctions can yield lower purchase prices. Given the many ways in which to configure on-line auctions, we extend existing research by using a laboratory experiment to investigate how different reverse auction configurations jointly influence bid price and suppliers' perceptions of buyer opportunism. Our findings suggest that supplier bid prices decrease over time as they participate in more eRAs, regardless of the configuration of auction parameters. However, the combination of rank (versus price) visibility, high (versus low) supplier need to win a contract, and six (versus three) competitors was significantly more effective than other combinations of variables in immediately reducing bid prices. The data also indicated that when suppliers' bids dropped substantially across auctions, their perceptions of opportunism increased. Notably, auction parameter combinations such as price visibility, three competitors, and low need for the contract yielded comparably low bids by the third auction, without any increases in perceived buyer opportunism.

However, the immediate costs of customer queues are primarily psychological, with subsequent costs being customer dissatisfaction and reduced future sales. A fundamental element of psychological waiting costs is wait-perception bias, which is the propensity to overestimate (or underestimate) the passage of time spent waiting. In 1985, Maister proposed a number of principles that affect wait-perception bias [Maister, D., 1985. The psychology of waiting lines. In: Czepiel, J., Solomon, M., Surprenant, C. (Eds.), The Service Encounter. Lexington Books, Lexington, MA, pp. 113-123]. Maister's principles have been frequently quoted in operations management literature, but they have rarely been put to empirical test. One challenge in trying to test these principles is that traditional empirical methods can make it very difficult to accurately represent specific waiting conditions while controlling for confounding factors. This article describes a video-based data collection methodology for studying wait-perception bias. We specifically look at Maister's principle about the impact of wait explanation on wait-perception bias. Results show that there is a significant difference in wait-perception bias due to the presence or absence of an explanation, but that whether the explanation focuses on customer cause or server cause makes little difference. The findings provide needed empirical support for one of Maister's principles, with additional contribution being the development of a video-based research methodology that is able to enrich queuing research by enabling the study of wait-perception bias.

This paper investigates whether improving the project plan can lead to improved success for high-risk projects. A quality of planning index was designed to explore how the presence of high risk affects, the quality of planning and project success. The index includes managerial aspects such as costs, human resources, procurement and quality, as well as organizational support aspects based on organization maturity models. In a field study based on data collected from 202 project managers regarding their most recent projects, it was found that the levels of risk at the beginning of projects has no effect on their final success. Drilling down to find an explanation for this surprising phenomenon, we found that in the presence of high risk, project managers significantly improve their project plans. Hence, in high-risk projects, better project plans improve all four dimensions of project success: schedule overrun, cost overrun, technical performance and customer satisfaction. However, in low-risk projects, better project plans did not contribute to reducing schedule or cost overruns. In other words, while endless risk management tools are developed, we found that improving the project plan is a more effective managerial tool in dealing with high-risk projects. Finally, the paper presents the most common planning tools currently being used in high-risk projects. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We use the logic underlying homologous models to examine whether relationships established at the firm level of data aggregation are also evident at the economic sector level. Specifically, we investigate the process-model which posits that the relationship between IT investment and financial performance is mediated by operational performance, albeit in the manufacturing sector using firm level data. We examine the process-model using publicly available sector level data from 1960 to 1999 in the manufacturing, retail and wholesale sectors of the U.S. economy. Our results provide strong support for the process-model and highlight inter-sector variations, suggesting that different contextual factors may be at play in the three sectors. Finally, examining the process-model at a higher level of aggregation contributes to the scant multi-level empirical research. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We attempt to clarify the semantic confusion surrounding lean production by conducting an extensive literature review using a historical evolutionary perspective in tracing its main components. We identify a key set of measurement items by charting the linkages between measurement instruments that have been used to measure its various components from the past literature, and using a rigorous, two-stage empirical method and data from a large set of manufacturing firms, we narrow the list of items selected to represent lean production to 48 items, empirically identifying 10 underlying components. In doing so, we map the operational space corresponding to conceptual space surrounding lean production. Configuration theory provides the theoretical underpinnings and helps to explain the synergistic relationships among its underlying components. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We form hypotheses using the value chain to specify the expected financial impact of SCM systems. By examining the change in financial performance pre- and post-adoption controlling for industry median changes in performance, we find that SCM systems increase gross margin, inventory turnover, market share, return on sales, and reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses. We also provide a model showing how process improvements around supply chain initiatives combine to improve overall performance. Finally, we show that contextual effects such as firms in the high-tech industry and the scope of the supply chain implementation have dramatic effects on the overall financial performance resulting from supply chain implementations.

However, NSD empirical investigations have been hindered by the lack of psychometrically sound measurement items and scales. This paper reports a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called NSD competence. NSD competence reflects an organization's expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. This competence is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: NSD process focus, market acuity, NSD strategy, NSD culture, and information technology experience. In the first stage of measure development, we analyse judgment-based, nominal-scaled data collected through an iterative item-sorting process to assess the tentative reliability and validity of the proposed measurement items. Our results demonstrate that a reduced set of measurement items have reasonable psychometric properties and, therefore, are useful inputs for multi-item measurement scale development. In the second stage of measurement development, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of the five NSD competence dimensions using survey data collected from a sample of retail bank key informants and confirm the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the proposed five multi-item scales. The NSD competence scales developed in this research may be used to advance scholarly understanding and theory in NSD. Further, these NSD scales may provide a useful diagnostic and benchmarking tool for managers seeking to assess and/or improve their firm's service innovation expertise. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Antecedents include embeddedness with suppliers, supply base rationalization, and supplier selection based on product development capabilities. Product innovation and quality are modeled as returns of supplier integration in product development. We also assess the moderating role that firm size may play in the relationships we posit. Our research framework relies primarily on the social network perspective (SNP) and using a sample of 157 firms we found support for many of the posited hypotheses. Specifically, we found that embeddedness with suppliers is positively related to supply base rationalization and supplier selection based on product development capabilities. Supply base rationalization has a significant positive impact on gray-box integration (i.e., suppliers working along side the customer's engineers for product development) but not black-box integration (i.e., suppliers carry out on their own the development of components or parts for the customers). On the other hand, selecting suppliers based on their product development capabilities leads to higher levels of both gray-box and black-box integration. Only gray-box integration manifests statistically significant positive effects towards product innovation. The effects of black-box integration are negligible. Product innovation exhibits strong positive effects on quality. We also found partial support for the moderating impact of firm size. Supply base rationalization practiced by small firms has a statistically significant negative impact on black-box integration but there is no statistically significant effect for large firms. Supply base rationalization is statistically related to gray-box integration only for large firms. Finally, the positive effects of product innovation on quality are more potent for large firms.

Increasingly, studies stress organizational culture as a key to managing innovation. Yet innovation-supportive culture remains an intricate and amorphous phenomenon. In response, we explore how organizational values - a foundational building block of culture - impact a particular process innovation, the implementation of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). To unpack this scarcely studied construct, we examine three-dimensions of organizational values: value profiles, value congruence and value-practice interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study views outsourcing effects from its future revenue-generation potential, using market value. The relation between firms' market valuation and outsourcing decisions is investigated using a cross-sectional valuation approach. Results based on Japanese manufacturing industries data from 1994 to 2002 indicate that core business-related outsourcing, offshore outsourcing, and shorter-term outsourcing have positive effects on outsourcing firms' market value. In contrast, non-core business-related outsourcing, domestic outsourcing, and longer-term outsourcing are not found to enhance firm value. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The alignment of the purchasing function with business strategy is essential, but previous work links better performance with the implementation of specific purchasing practices. This article develops a different approach focused on purchasing capabilities rather than purchasing practices and proposes that purchasing's contribution to business performance depends on the degree to which purchasing capabilities fit with and support the business strategy. By adapting the Theory of Production Competence to the purchasing context, this article distinguishes two levels of fit: between purchasing strategic objectives and purchasing capabilities, defined as "purchasing efficacy," and between business strategy and purchasing strategic objectives, which is viewed as an immediate consequence of the strategic integration of purchasing. The interaction between both levels of fit influences business commercial and financial performance, and an empirical analysis of 141 industrial companies supports this proposition.

As a result, there have been both demands for an increase in Service Operations Management (SOM) research since the 1980s on the one hand, and, on the other, predictions that such an increase will take place [e.g.: Buffa, E.S., 1980. Research in Operations Management. Journal of Operations Management 1 (1), 1-8; Miller, J.G., Graham, M.B.W., Freeland, J.R., Hottenstein, M., Maister, D.M., Meredith, J., Schmenner, R.W., 1981.

This contradiction calls for an in-depth study of the state of affairs of SOM research, and we have conducted just such a study in 10 of the most relevant and representative outlets in the OM field, as well as in pipeline research (Proceedings of the POMS, DSI and EurOMA Conferences). Our results aim to provide answers to the following questions, amongst others: (1) Is greater importance now attached to SOM research within OM research? (2) What are the main topics of research? Are they the same topics that have been proposed in SOM research agendas? (3) What methods are used in SOM research? (4) What are the most commonly studied sectors of economic activities? (5) Are there any differences from OM research in terms of content and methods? Some of our findings show that although a growth in SOM research had been predicted in earlier studies, there is still only a minimal amount done (7.5% of OM research); seven topics command 61.5% of SOM research, which (with some exceptions) is consistent with SOM research agendas; there is more research done on strategic issues than on tactical/operational issues; models and simulations are still more common than empirical research, but trends point to a shift to the latter; the majority of research focuses on a specific sector, and three sectors account for 50% of the total; there is a clear connection between type of journal and type of research, research method and sector of activity.

At the same time, such information, or lack thereof, can also impact the behavior of project managers in ways that do not directly focus on work objectives but nevertheless affect performance. The research developed in this paper is primarily focused on demonstrating both direct and moderating effects that information can have on decision makers' actions and perceptions in an environment where multiple projects are pursued simultaneously. In order to study these linkages we designed and executed a controlled experiment designed to simulate aspects common to a multi-party project management environment. Our findings suggest that greater visibility of situational information in this environment impacts project outcomes mainly by affecting a project manager's actions and perceptions regarding both the behavior of others and the priority given to his/her task. The study extends existing information processing theory by developing and examining notions of informed rationality and reciprocity, as well as examining the effect of information on post-task sense making. Insights from the study suggest a set of behavioral issues that should be considered in future information processing and project management research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For large engineered equipment, a relatively recent but increasingly common production strategy has arisen to better meet today's competitive pressures for faster delivery of more customized products without increasing costs. A hybrid of the make-to-order (MTO) and make-to-stock (MTS) production strategies, manufacturers launch major product models to a demand forecast (MTS) and then modify the partially completed products as the actual orders arrive (MTO), a production strategy we refer to as make-to-forecast (MTF). This paper has two purposes: (1) it describes and conceptualizes the MTF situation in a variety of industries and places the MTF strategy among the other major production strategies in the theory of production and (2) it analyzes decision rules for matching partially completed units to incoming customer orders-one of the unique and perhaps most demanding challenges of the MTF environment. It shows that two order matching rules developed in the paper outperform the ad hoc rules commonly used in practice. We test and confirm the generalizability of the superior performance of these two rules in 13 different industry variations of the MTF production situation. Last, the insights provided by the model are discussed in terms of their practical relevance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In addition it examines the direct and moderating effects of two organizational constructs-operational autonomy and risk-taking propensity. Analysis of data from 102 firms in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA indicates that both differentiation strategy and operational autonomy are positively related with process innovativeness, while an organization's risk-taking propensity has no such relationship. In addition, operational autonomy moderates the relationship between differentiation strategy and process innovativeness, while no evidence was found for the moderating effect of risk-taking propensity on this relationship. Further sub-group analysis shows that in TSOs with high levels of operational autonomy, risk-taking propensity has a positive moderating effect on the above relationship. Post hoc analysis also establishes positive links among process innovativeness and firm performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the process, firms have started to incorporate new service providers in their commercial interactions with customers over the Internet. This paper studies conceptually and empirically why Internet commerce firms (ICFs) have established relationships with these providers. Focusing on logistics services in outbound distribution channels, we rely on transaction cost theory to reveal that low levels of asset specificity and uncertainty drive Internet commerce firms to establish these relationships. Moreover, we apply strategic network theory to show that Internet commerce firms seek these providers because they offer access to relationship networks that bundle many complementary logistics services. In addition, logistics service providers make these services available across new and existing relationships between the Internet commerce firms, their customers, and their vendors.

Yet, despite positive attitudes towards collaboration and several pilot implementations undertaken in the beginning of the millennium, large-scale implementations of collaborative forecasting are still scarce. This article presents the results of an exploratory case study examining four collaboration projects involving four manufacturers and one retailer operating in the European grocery sector. By analyzing the positive and negative experiences of these companies and the results of their collaboration projects, factors that have an impact on the feasibility and value of forecasting collaboration are identified. A main finding is that many collaboration models appear to build on invalid assumptions concerning retailers' forecasting needs, resources, and processes, as well as manufacturers' capabilities to benefit from the demand or forecast information made available through collaboration.

The antecedents of supply chain agility of a firm: Scale development and model testing, Journal of Operations Management 24 (2), 170-188.) The study is based on empirical data collected from U.S. manufacturing plants operating in India and their small suppliers. While globalization is causing hundreds of multinational firms from developed countries to locate manufacturing facilities in developing countries such as China and India, the supply chain environment in China and India is different from domestic supply chains environments familiar to U.S. manufacturers venturing to such countries. For global ventures of multinationals to succeed, multinational firms must strive to understand the supply environment and practices in countries such as China and India. The literature on supply chain has two shortcomings. First, studies have not investigated the result of matched plant and supplier flexibility. Second, although, supply chain in the U.S. has been investigated by numerous researchers, the same is not true about the supply chains in developing countries such as China and India. This paper strives to fill these two voids. A survey of U.S. manufacturing plants in given SIC classifications found that U.S. plants preferred the following: (1) stable JIT suppliers and (2) proximate flexible suppliers. An Additional finding was that suppliers were engaged in: (1) JIT material supply and (2) automated material supply. Our regression model explains up to 38% of the variance in profitability (power = 0.7). A notable finding about fit is that profitability is highest when an inflexible plant uses small inflexible suppliers. Profitability is above average when a flexible plant uses flexible small suppliers. In contrast, if there is a mismatch of plant flexibility with supplier flexibility, the profitability is below average. The regression model for WIP inventory explains over 44% of the variance (power = 0.9). Lower levels of WIP inventory were associated with TIT practices of small suppliers. The mismatch between factory and supplier flexibility is associated with lower WIP inventory, a finding that deserves further investigation. This study demonstrates one practical method of studying the fit between a factory and its suppliers. Methodological contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it demonstrates how to select and use appropriate research tools to conduct scientific studies using borderline samples. This is a useful contribution to the OM area when OM empirical research is routinely shying away from borderline samples. Second, interaction effects are investigated at great depth using methods not seen in OM literature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study extends prior AMT research by examining the role of complementary assets in explaining how AMT adoption contributes to manufacturing performance. In addition, the study provides a finer-grained analysis of associations between Process and Planning AMT usage and various aspects of manufacturing performance. We analyze data from 224 manufacturing plants in order to test the hypotheses that DMI moderates the relationships between AMT usage and manufacturing performance. Regression analysis results indicate that DMI plays the role of complementary asset to AMT usage when quality, delivery and process flexibility are considered. A complementary role is not observed for cost efficiency and new product flexibility. In fact, the results suggest that combined high levels of DMI and AMT usage can be costly. We discuss the implications of the findings for a contingency theory of AMT success, for future research, and for managerial practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is arguably the first Operations Management textbook. In it the author describes the management and technologies of the mining and metallurgical industry of the period. Using the translation by Herbert and Lou Hoover, this paper reviews the book both to compare it with contemporary writing on Operations Management in process industries, and to draw lessons from its impact. Many areas which we see as contemporary, such as ethical and environmental issues, are explicitly addressed in the book although with a different view of their impact than today. The book describes how the operations should be organized and managed, the role of the foreman, and the education and training required. The characteristics of process industries as described by Agricola are compared to modern views. The most enduring lesson from this remarkable book is the importance of systematic capture and dissemination of knowledge in Operations Management. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The scale and complexity of these machines meant their realisation was dependent upon the latest industrial advances like parts standardization and machine tool technology. As a result Babbage committed large amounts of his time and money to the theoretical and empirical study of advanced production and engineering practice. This paper argues that Charles Babbage deserves to be recognised as a pioneer in the field of operations management. His path-breaking contributions were born of a singular intellect and degree of creativity combined with a commitment to empiricist scientific method and statistical measurement. Moreover, he was working as Britain transformed itself into the most highly industrialized country the world had ever seen. The paper draws in particular upon the various editions of his best-selling book, 'On the Economy of Machines and Manufactures', first published in 1832. It reviews the many core operations principles evident in Babbage's analyses and highlights insights that remain relevant to today's theoretical and practical concerns. The paper concludes with a discussion of how a combination of contextual and biographical factors left Charles Babbage a largely unsung pioneer in the field of operations management.

Although Canada's abundance of natural resources led to the development of primary industries in the 17th and 18th centuries, the manufacturing industry was not significant until the early 19th century. Four representative manufacturing industries are discussed to illustrate the overall trend in the chronological evolution of Canadian manufacturing in the 19th and 20th centuries. The role and impact of factors such as transportation, electricity, foreign investment, particularly by U.S. entrepreneurs, and government support for industry is reviewed to understand their impact on manufacturing as it has evolved to the present. It appears that these were indeed influential and thus are factors that other countries in a less developed stage of their manufacturing evolution may look to for directions. Our analysis also shows that Canadian manufacturing which began by producing simple items in small volumes due to geographical diversity and the absence of a large market, moved into the mass manufacturing age only in the 20th century. But in the 21st century due to competition from low labour cost countries Canada has moved back to customized manufacturing though in sophisticated goods such as aircraft manufacturing and biotech. While there are bright spots in Canadian manufacturing, recent studies also show that work needs to be done to produce more value added products and ensure Canadian manufacturing competitiveness in the global market place.

Our focus for this study was the Fred Harvey Company, which operated a highly successful string of restaurants and hotels along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad line starting in 1876, reaching its peak around 1912, and continuing until the early 1950s. Fred Harvey was a visionary businessman who understood many of the key concepts guiding the most successful service operations today. This article describes the operating system Harvey used for delivering 15 million meals per year in 65 restaurants extending over a span reaching from Chicago to San Francisco. The underpinnings of Harvey's system foretold concepts considered new today, particularly the service profit chain [Heskett, J., Jones, T., Loveman, G., Sasser Jr., W.E., Schlesinger, L., 1994] and its reliance on a clear operations strategy supported by well-trained, loyal employees and a congruent system of measurement. It is significant that Harvey achieved his success without the advantages of modern information systems by relying, instead, on his iconic leadership, dogged attention to mundane details, and the service culture he was able to embed throughout the far-flung enterprise.

In the 1950s, a team led by Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon, which also included Bonini and Winters, worked on aggregate production planning and forecasting and published a series of papers and a book. The literature contains reports of at least 73 applications of their work in four companies and three application studies. Holt et al.'s work and its visibility led to a renaissance of the field of operations and supply chain management as we know it today and brought two paradigm changes in the domain and the role of operations and supply chain management. First, seemingly unrelated and non-managerial individual functions started to emerge as parts of an integrated system of managing production. Second, aggregate production planning brought to forefront the central role of operations management by linking it with supply chains and other functions in the organization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Elwood Spencer Buffa first published his textbook, Modern Production Management, in 1961. He had degrees in business and engineering and had worked as an industrial engineer. He was also part of the UCLA-RAND academic complex whose operations researchers coined the term management science and conceived the idea of The Institute of Management Sciences. Buffa coined the term operations management and consolidated knowledge from various streams of production management, including operations research and industrial engineering, into a coherent managerial framework. Modern business education had started to emerge around 1959 after reports from the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford Foundation recommended improving research and analytical approaches. Many business schools created courses in POM. At the time, no single book covered what we now call production and operations management. The POM faculty at most business schools, including Columbia's Graduate School of Business, adopted Buffa's book enthusiastically when they introduced courses in "production management". Buffa was an extraordinary visionary who covered supply chain management, design for manufacturing, quality management, service operations, and computer applications and the automated factory. The POM community pursued these issues more actively 2 or 3 decades later. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By 2000, services comprised almost 80% of U.S. employment. This rapid growth was caused by several factors including changing population lifestyles, deregulation, and new and improved infrastructure including the widespread availability of new technologies. With the service sector surpassing 50% of the U.S. economy in the 1950s, researchers - especially economists - began to examine the characteristics of services and attempt to apply some of the concepts that were developed and proven in manufacturing. From these early efforts there emerged a growing demand for business schools to develop both research agendas and courses in service operations. Beginning at the Harvard Business School in the early 1970s, and continuing through to the present, research and courses in service operations have evolved from simply applying basic manufacturing concepts in a service environment to recognizing the need for a trans-disciplinary approach appropriately suited to the particular characteristics of service operations. This article traces the evolution of service operations from its immediate prebusiness school days through its early years as an academic discipline in business schools to the present, identifying "pioneers" in service operations who truly blazed a previously unmarked trail that many have since followed.

At this point in its development, as it transitions from niche to mainstream, it is important to review what has been accomplished and what deficiencies remain so that both the promise and problems impeding greater acceptance can be examined. To that end, we review the evolution of principal TOC concepts and practices in an objective fashion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Those elements - quick set-up, small lots, cells, kanban, and so on - are well known. Rather than explaining them again, this paper's objective is to explore the sequence of events leading to JPM as a competitive force globally, as well as its impact on theory and practices in operations management. JPM's evolution includes shifting terminologies, fusions and adulterations; limited extensions from manufacturing into services and innovative enhancements, largely of Western origin. Longitudinal research data, based on inventory trends, provide insights on JPM's diffusions and its uneven results. Latter-day puzzling lapses and disappointments, among Japanese as well as Western companies, raise questions about JPM's sustainability, as well as some of its changing manifestations. While the core of Japanese production management, now over three decades old, appears to have become solidly mainstream, its current and future states are problematic. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The book 'The machine that changed the World' that introduced the term 'lean production' in 1990 has become one of the most widely cited references in operations management over the last decade. Despite the fact that the just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing concept had been known for almost a decade prior, the book played a key role in disseminating the concept outside of Japan. While the technical aspects of lean production have been widely discussed, this paper sets out to investigate the evolution of the research at the MIT International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) that led to the conception of the term 'lean production'. Furthermore, the paper investigates why - despite the pre-existing knowledge of JIT - the program was so influential in promoting the lean production concept. Based on iterating series of interviews with the key authors, contributors and researchers of the time, this paper presents an historical account of the research that led to the formulation and dissemination of one of the most influential manufacturing paradigms of recent times.

344	Karmarkar US	2007	J OPER MANAG	25	438		Journal	Article	18	Operations management in the information economy: Information products, processes, and chains	WOS:000245527600017	information economy; information products; information processes; information chains; information intensive services	INTENSIVE SERVICES; TECHNOLOGY	2	The process of economic evolution from agriculture to manufacturing to services is nearing its end in the U.S. and other developed economies. Another major evolution along a different dimension is now underway: it is from a material-based economy to art information-based economy. In the past, the product-service dichotomy has proved useful as an organizing principle for the study of operations management. Today, however, a material-information categorization of products and services appears to be equally important and useful. The information sector now comprises the major share of the U.S. private economy and includes many of the largest industrial sectors and firms. We discuss the implications of this evolution for research and teaching in operations management (OM). The basic questions addressed here are: In what ways are information products, services, processes and chains similar to, or different from, those in the material world? To what extent is it possible to manage operations in information industries using the existing operations management concepts and techniques? The conclusions are mixed. To a great extent, traditional concepts are indeed applicable and useful. However, there are significant differences. For example, quantification and measurement pose a fundamental problem in the study of information industries. As a result, there are difficulties in analyzing some of the most basic OM issues related to productivity, cost, value, and transformation. Nevertheless, the process-centric methods of operations management can be quite effective in analyzing firms and industries that produce information goods and services. An understanding of process economics and information chains is also central to the analysis of competition given the impact of new technologies on processes, firms, information chains and information industries. We conclude that while there is much in the information sector that can be addressed with our current toolkit, some very interesting and challenging issues still remain open for research. From the perspective of management education too, operations management in the information economy is an area of growing importance, with some easy wins and some significant challenges.

We describe how supply chains have evolved over the last three decades, arguing that their organizational history can be divided into three periods. In the first period, the primary focus was on how to make operations throughout the supply chain more efficient. In the second period, the focus shifted from efficiency to effectiveness as leading firms began to incorporate the ideas and expertise of their suppliers and partners into the management of the supply chain. In the current period, some firms are beginning to explore how supply chains can be extended across industries in addition to operating efficiently and effectively within industries.

Transaction cost theory (TCT) has been the dominant means of explaining outsourcing as an economizing approach whereby cost efficiencies are achieved by assigning transactions to different governance mechanisms. Recent research has used the resource-based view (RBV) to examine the role of specialized capabilities as a potential source of value creation in relationships between firms. Although research in supply chain management has expanded substantially, only limited applications of TCTand the RBV are available, especially in the field of operations management. We extend both perspectives to explain conditions leading to strategic outsourcing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ability of a strategy supply chain to engender cultural competitiveness, or joint entrepreneurship and learning aimed at filling market gaps, is a key path through which a strategic supply chain may become a competitive advantage. A balance of trust and power within the supply chain offsets uncertainty and risks associated with the behaviors underlying cultural competitiveness. Using a multi-theoretic perspective, we discuss four strategies that firms use to balance a climate of trust and power in a strategic supply chain. Identifying an authority, generating a common supply chain identity, utilizing boundary spanning ties, and providing procedural and interactive justice are the strategies we discuss.

Managed supply chains offer the promise of added value through proactive cooperative efforts among participating firms. However, as a strategic alliance, managed supply chains represent a form of social dilemma: supply chain alliances may fail because participating firms fear opportunistic behavior on the part of other alliance participants, and as a consequence underinvest their information and resources into the alliance. The interdependence structure of the alliance may contribute to this problem. Viewing managed supply chains as a form of social dilemma also identifies solutions that may be implemented unilaterally by individual firms or jointly by the alliance to maintain the "indispensable virtue" of high trust that allows supply chains to effectively create added value.

However, despite these widespread prescriptions, the potential for supplier opportunism means that supermarket retailers are either skeptical or have failed to make such category management relationships with key suppliers work. Drawing on agency, transaction costs, and network theory, we synthesize insights from qualitative fieldwork with retailer and supplier managers and primary data from 73 category managers in U.K. supermarket retailers to empirically examine antecedents and consequences of category-level focal supplier opportunism. Our findings suggest that focal supplier opportunism decreases retailer category performance and increases militant behaviors among non-focal suppliers in the category supply chain. Consistent with retailer fears, we find that focal suppliers with significant influence in retailers' category management efforts are more likely to engage in opportunistic behavior. However, our results also reveal that retailer fears that being dependent on a focal supplier will lead to greater supplier opportunism are largely unfounded, while supplier dependence on the retailer is also unrelated to focal supplier opportunism. Finally, we find that retailers' ability to monitor - but not to punish - its focal suppliers is negatively related to opportunistic behavior among focal suppliers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We identify linkages between supply chain management research on supplier development and organization theory research on social capital to consider how buying firm commitment to a long-term relationship, cognitive capital (goals and values), structural capital (information sharing, supplier evaluation, supplier development), and relational capital (length of relationship, buyer dependency, supplier dependency) are related to buying firm performance improvements (cost improvements, and quality, delivery, flexibility improvements). Analysis of buying firms from the U.S. automotive and electronics industries provides support for the theory that buyer commitment and social capital accumulation with key suppliers can improve buying company performance. Moreover, the findings suggest that the relationships of structural and relational capital vary depending on the type of performance improvement considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Yet resource dependence theory suggests that when tides rise, some boats are lifted more than others; members who furnish important resources or resources where control is concentrated have bargaining power. Drawing on Thompson [Thompson, J.D., 1967. Organizations in Action. McGraw-Hill, New York], we argue that strong firms' bargaining power use is tempered by the type of coordination different types of task interdependencies demand. We also investigate how both strong and weak members benefit from SCM. Whereas strong members reap most of the direct benefits, weak members can often gain by building switching costs with strong members, leveraging SCM outside the focal chain, and increasing survival chances.

While all suppliers adopted the program as an apparent response to coercive institutional pressures from their customer, the study focuses on the effects of such pressures on internal information processing and the behavior of the actors involved. The study therefore addresses a significant gap in the institutional theory literature concerning the question of how managers reconcile potential conflicts between externally imposed institutional demands and internal operational efficiency constraints. Specifically, the supplier development process is conceptualized using two different approaches: one based on assumptions of rational efficiency, the other based on assumptions of institutional image construction. Five propositions were tested using quantitative data from the customer and interview data from the suppliers. Overall, the two propositions based on image construction were supported while only one proposition of the three for the rational decision making approach was partially supported. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding how a firm's institutional context influences the implementation and use of operation management strategies.

Rather than competing "firm versus firm," today's organizations are battling "supply chain versus supply chain." Within this context, best value supply chains are emerging as a means to create competitive advantages and superior performance. While traditional supply chains often focus primarily on one key outcome such as speed or cost, best value supply chains excel along an array of uniquely integrated priorities - cost, quality, speed, and flexibility. We describe how key organizational theories help to distinguish traditional supply chains from best value supply chains. To provide a foundation for future inquiry, we offer theory-based research questions that are focused on best value supply chains. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While some progress has been made since then, contemporary authors argue that limited dialogue between operations management and behavioral researchers continues to restrict the interpretability of such studies. Drawing on expertise from both operations and behavioral research, and motivated by a case example, we intend to further this dialogue. In doing so, we outline interdisciplinary commonalities and several methodological pitfalls that those studying the links between resource constraints and operational performance should take into account when developing new research. These issues range from appropriate model conceptualization to operationalization for empirical studies. Recommendations for appropriately confronting methodological concerns related to these issues are provided. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In some particular industries (i.e., music), the Internet has also provided consumers with unprecedented opportunities to consider retail offers involving physical goods (i.e., CDs) alongside specialized services. As shown in this paper, these circumstances have important implications for the design and management of customer relationships. These circumstances also permeate relationships across retail and wholesale echelons in music supply chains. In particular, an empirical analysis shows that online consumer access to information on CD retail markups compels retailers to market, a level of service quality that is consistent with that markup information. However, limitations in consumer access to markup data, available only to wholesalers and to Internet retailers, allow retailers to inversely link their markups to the fulfillment service quality offered to consumers with wholesaler support.

The quality and cost of a product or service offered in the market is a function, not only of the capabilities of the firm, but also the supplier network providing inputs to the enterprise. To remain competitive, organizations are increasingly implementing supplier development programs to maintain capable and high performance supply bases. This paper presents a conceptual model of an organization's efforts to improve supplier performance. Then latent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM) is used to test the model with data for 215 supplier development experiences from US manufacturing firms. The results suggest that evaluation and certification efforts are the most important supplier development prerequisites before undertaking operational knowledge transfer activities such as site visits and supplier training. Furthermore, collaborative inter-organizational communication is identified as important supporting factor in transforming an organization's efforts to develop suppliers into supplier performance improvements.

The results are based on a sample of 186 announcements of ERP implementations, 140 SCM implementations, and 80 CRM implementations. Our analysis of the financial benefits of these implementations yields mixed results. In the case of ERP systems, we observe some evidence of improvements in profitability but not in stock returns. The results for improvements in profitability are stronger in the case of early adopters of ERP systems. On average, adopters of SCM system experience positive stock returns as well as improvements in profitability. There is no evidence of improvements in stock returns or profitability for firms that have invested in CRM. Although our results are not uniformly positive across the different enterprise systems (ES), they are encouraging in the sense that despite the high implementation costs, we do not find persistent evidence of negative performance associated with ES investments.

The use of organizational theory to formulate propositions regarding the effects of such factors is especially scarce in the TQM literature. This study uses institutional theory and contingency theory as the basis to test a number of such propositions. First, a model of TQM and organizational performance is developed. Then using survey data, the effects of five contextual factors-three institutional factors and two contingency factors-on the implementation of TQM practices and on the impact of TQM on key organizational performance measures are analyzed within a TQM-performance relationships model framework. The three institutional factors include TQM implementation, ISO 9000 registration, and country of origin, and the two contingency factors include company size and scope of operations. The results show that the implementation of all TQM practices is similar across subgroups of companies within each contextual factor. In addition, the effects of TQM on four performance measures, as well as the relationships among these measures, are generally similar across subgroup companies. Thus, for the five contextual factors analyzed, the overall findings do not provide support for the argument that TQM and TQM-performance relationships are context-dependent. The implications of the study for managers and researchers, as well as study limitations, are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since no solid theory exists, managers are uncertain whether both formality and discretion can be simultaneously applied, though it is clear that both are needed in R&D projects. This study aims to develop a model that conceptualizes and brings empirical evidence for the relationship between formality, discretion and R&D project performance. More than 1500 participants from 62 R&D projects, and 248 customer representatives in one high technology electronics company responded to questionnaires that measured formality, discretion, uncertainty, and additional control variables. Each project's performance was assessed using the company's information system on deviation from objectives in unit-cost (in US$), total project cost (in US$), time-to-market (in months), project product mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR), and customer satisfaction. Results demonstrated that formality and discretion are distinct constructs of project execution. Each was found to positively affect R&D project performance; moreover, interaction existed in their relationships with performance. In other words, the positive relationship between formality and the performance achievement in R&D projects is stronger in projects that allow higher discretion than in projects that restrict members' discretion. Implications for R&D management theory and practice are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Achieving optimal benefits from non-financial audits will, however, require that auditors and their clients obtain a greater understanding of and appreciation for the appropriate roles, responsibilities and skills of the non-financial auditor. This research uses data obtained from surveys of 126 practicing non-financial auditors and 400 non-financial audit clients in Australasia to test two propositions about the roles and requirements of non-financial auditors. The results indicate that non-financial auditors believe they are providing a style of auditing that is strongly focused on developing continuous improvement of client's quality systems. Non-financial auditors also appear to have a desire to meet what they perceive to be the requirements of certified organizations by emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement focused auditing. However, their clients have the opposite perception believing that they are getting less continuous improvement focused auditing than they would like, and more compliance auditing than they need. The results show that client organizations are, in general, looking for a more balanced approach to non-financial auditing in terms of compliance and continuous improvement. The evidence also suggests that a major constraint identified relates to some fundamental issues of auditor independence. This dilemma created is apparent both in the understanding of what the appropriate role of the auditor is (in both the mind of the client and the auditor), and in the nature of the different roles each plays as a stakeholder in a quality system.

Using data from a variety of manufacturing industries, this study examines four different types of strategic integration at the manufacturing plant level. We use a path analytic approach to simultaneously assess the contributions of the various types of integration to manufacturing-based competitive capabilities and business level performance. In addition, we examine the intervening roles that manufacturing-based competitive capabilities play in mediating the relationships between strategic integration and business performance. We find that each type of integration activity has unique benefits and detriments. These findings extend prior studies of manufacturing and supply chain integration by broadening the theory relating to strategic integration. The results also provide implications for manufacturing managers who seek to design integration policies and associated resource deployments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Further, most prior studies that compare journals have relied on single-item measures of such evaluation dimensions as quality and relevance. In order to address these research gaps, a survey instrument targeted to purchasing and supply management academics was implemented to explore how they evaluate and rate journals considered important for advancing the field of PSM. The three highest-rated journals in this study that publish PSM research are the Journal of Operations Management, the Journal of Business Logistics, and the Journal of Supply Chain Management. Four journal evaluation constructs emerged: Journal Quality, Journal Reputation, PSM Practitioner Relevance, and PSM Research Relevance. The results provide guidance for PSM scholars with respect to journals that contribute to the knowledge base in PSM, as well as support an extended understanding of conceptual bases for how scholars evaluate the journals they read and in which they publish.

However, researchers have suggested that computer-mediated interaction with suppliers may not be conducive to strong supplier relationships in general and to trust in particular. This paper compares two computer-mediated sourcing tools (email negotiation and Internet reverse auctions) with face-to-face negotiation. Information richness theory suggests that the different media will produce different impacts relating to sellers' trust in buyers. Data are generated with a simulation experiment using 117 subjects. We found that information richness affects seller-buyer trust: Sellers who used face-to-face negotiation, the richest medium in the study, always reported higher trust in their buyer counterparts than did sellers using Internet reverse auctions. There were also some trust advantages of face-to-face negotiation over email and limited advantages of email over reverse auctions. We also found that procurement complexity influences the relationship between information richness and trust. As hypothesized, when face-to-face negotiation is used, procurement complexity has no effect on seller trust. When reverse auctions are utilized, the greater the complexity of the purchase, the less the seller trust. However, when email is used, greater procurement complexity is associated with greater seller trust, and there are no differences in trust between the email and face-to-face channels. Finally, we found that sellers' trust in buyers is positively associated with sellers' desire for future dealings with the buyer. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we examine the influences of MMI in each of four stages of new product development (NPD) on new product time and success. A path analysis of data collected from 467 completed NPD projects indicates that increased MMI in each stage of product development is respectively associated with greater product competitive advantage, which in turn is associated with higher project return on investment (ROI). Greater MMI is also significantly associated with longer product commercialisation (PC) stages of new product development, but the data indicate little significant relationship between NPD project time and project return on investment. Hence, increased MMI may require added NPD time, but this drawback appears to be outweighed by the added benefits accrued to greater product competitive advantage. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This article sets out to examine and critique the current state of OM PCR. We review OM PCR studies through the lens of the major theoretical view on contingencies, contingency theory, along a number of relevant dimensions: contingency variables, performance variables, measurement, research design and employed form of fit. In this process, we put forward a number of tasks that need to be accomplished in order to move OM PCR forward and develop more solid conceptual foundations in which to anchor rigorous research in this area. Finally. we reflect on the theoretical arguments that underlie OM PCR (which are based on the contingency approach) and identify its limitations in fully explaining the currently observed patterns of use of OM practices and associated performance outcomes. As a result, we propose that in order to increase our understanding of these patterns, OM scholars need to study in more depth the process of selection of OM best practices by organizations. Accordingly, we put forward a framework to underpin such research integrating contingency theory and other theoretical perspectives. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Building upon the knowledge-based view of the firm, we argue that internal and external learning are two knowledge-generation routines that contribute to effective process implementation. Effective process implementation, in turn, is a knowledge-based manufacturing capability, which, as a function of internal and external teaming, leads to mass customization capability. We employ structural equation modeling to empirically test the effects of learning on mass customization capability, mediated by effective process implementation, using survey data collected from 100 manufacturing plants in 3 industries and 6 countries. Our results provide empirical evidence supporting the proposed model of the effect of internal and external learning on mass customization capability, fully mediated by effective process implementation. This research is one of the first studies to integrate insights from the knowledge-based view of the firm and mass customization. It complements the OM view of mass customization, which to date has largely focused on the technical side, by demonstrating the role of managerial practices and learning in cultivating mass customization capability in a manufacturing environment.

While it is crucial to identify the operational performance that helps create competitive advantage, it is equally important to understand the means for delivering the needed performance at the operational level. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), we argue that routines are a critical source of operations capabilities and subsequently investigate operations capabilities by means of their underlying routines. Because a common problem to studying capabilities is the ambiguous and confusing definitions, we conduct an extensive literature review to address the semantic confusion among various definitions of capabilities and delineate it from other related terms. We identify improvement and innovation as two critical plant level capabilities, each consisting of a bundle of interrelated yet distinct routines. We then empirically measure the two capabilities as second-order latent variables and estimate their effects on a set of operational performance measures. The results suggest that routines form internally consistent bundles which are significantly related to operational performance. This supports our notion of "capabilities as routine bundles" that are difficult to imitate and thus a source of competitive advantage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After an extensive cross-disciplinary review of the general team and project management literatures, we constructed and tested a theoretically based, five-dimensional model of organizational context, project team design, project team leadership, project team processes, and project outcome factors. We examined the model by means of an empirical study of 56 newly completed capital projects executed by 15 Fortune 500 companies in the process industries. The results indicate the value of disaggregating project outcomes for research purposes. Different bundles of project team factors were found to drive project cost, schedule, and operability. Project team efficacy, cross-functional project teams, autonomous project team structure, and virtual office usage were the strongest predictors of project cost effectiveness. Continuity of project leadership, cross-functional project teams, and project manager incentives were the strongest predictors of project construction schedule. In contrast, clear project goals and an office design to facilitate effective communication were the main predictors of plant operability. Implications of these findings for researchers and project practitioners are discussed. One major practical implication of our findings is that project managers need to clearly focus and prioritize their goals for each project so they can adopt the appropriate bundles of project team practices that will facilitate their goal achievement.

We focus particularly on Internet retailing in a drop-ship context, because this model provides a purer separation of these activities and the related costs and constitutes a critical context for the empirical examination of the relationship between retailer margins and promises. Drawing upon retailer and consumer perspectives, we articulate and justify a set of propositions regarding the relationships among different Internet retailer margins and promised product distribution service performance. We examine a sample comprising over 2000 retail transactions with customers and find partial empirical support for the set of propositions. Specifically, the results show that product margins and the margins on shipping and handling are inversely proportional. We also find a direct relationship between promised product distribution service performance and shipping and handling margins even after key product characteristics known to influence the cost side of the margin equation are controlled for. These results confirm an intuitively logical view of the relationships among pricing and promised product distribution service performance. The study also offers insights for practitioners regarding the opportunity to enhance performance in this domain and demonstrates the benefit and power of employing objective measures drawn from the vast array of information captured via online transactions.

The onus rests on the manufacturer's ability to implement operational strategies that help the retailer achieve its objectives. Specifically, manufacturers that establish successful order fulfillment service can affect retailer loyalty. The overarching goal of this research, therefore, is to examine the importance to operations managers of understanding the order fulfillment needs and expectations of their retail customers and to establish the value-added role that operations management plays in developing retailer loyalty. Empirical evidence is provided on the relationships between relational order fulfillment service, operational order fulfillment service, satisfaction, affective commitment, purchase behavior, and loyalty. Such evidence not only focuses on the strategic importance of the OM discipline in manufacturer-retailer relationships, but also extends previous OM theory by taking a more complex view of the loyalty phenomenon.

The research investigates the links among organizational structure (formalization and integration), supply chain process variability, and performance as moderated by environmental uncertainty. We found that in a predictable demand environment, only formal control affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial results; but in an unpredictable demand environment, only cross-functional integration affects supply chain process variability, leading to improved financial performance. We also examined whether supply chain process variability is a complete or partial mediator of the relationship between organizational structure and performance, and found that: (1) in a predictable demand environment, supply chain process variability completely mediates the relationship between formal control and performance and (2) in an unpredictable demand environment, supply chain process variability partially mediates the relationship between integration and performance. Supply chain process variability has an inverse relationship with financial performance, regardless of the demand environment and organizational structure provides managers with the mechanisms to mitigate this variability's detrimental impact on financial performance.

Our sample consists of 100 individuals drawn from 42 organizations that were involved in different innovation-driven horizontal networks. The results of structural equation modeling suggest that the perceived use of both personal power bases and position power bases by the broker are positively related to the strength of ties between members. Strength of ties, on the other hand, is positively related to NPD project outcomes of design performance and development time. Finally, results show that the relationships between a broker's use of different power bases and NPD project outcomes are fully mediated by the strength of ties between networks members.

Proponents of such programs stress the promise of improved efficiency and profitability. But research has not consistently borne out these prospects. Moreover, the expectation of universal benefits is not consistent with research highlighting the important role of firm-specific capabilities in sustaining competitive advantage. In this paper, we use longitudinal panel data on ISO 9000 practices for firms in the auto supplier industry to study two new issues related to the adoption of process management practices. First, we find that, as the majority of firms within an industry adopt ISO 9000, late adopters no longer gain financial benefits from these practices. Second, we explore how firms' technological coherence moderates the performance advantages of ISO 9000 practices. We find that firms that have a very narrow or very broad technological focus have fewer opportunities for complementary interactions that arise from process management practices and thus benefit less than those with limited breadth in technologically related activities.

There is a criticism that Six Sigma simply puts traditional quality management practices in a new package. To investigate this issue and the role of Six Sigma in quality management, this study reviewed both the traditional quality management and Six Sigma literatures and identified three new practices that are critical for implementing Six Sigma's concept and method in an organization. These practices are referred to as: Six Sigma role structure, Six Sigma structured improvement procedure, and Six Sigma focus on metrics. A research model and survey instrument were developed to investigate how these Six Sigma practices integrate with seven traditional quality management practices to affect quality performance and business performance. Test results based on a sample of 226 US manufacturing plants revealed that the three Six Sigma practices are distinct practices from traditional quality management practices, and that they complement the traditional quality management practices in improving performance. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed and further research directions are offered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the influence of employee attributes on these performance dimensions has rarely been examined. In this study we investigate the impact of employee satisfaction on operational performance in high-contact service industries. Based oil an empirical study of 206 service shops in Hong Kong, we examined the hypothesized relationships among employee satisfaction, service quality, customer satisfaction, and firm profitability. Using structural equations modeling, we found that employee satisfaction is significantly related to service quality and to customer satisfaction, while the latter in turn influences firm profitability. We also found that firm profitability has it moderate non-recursive effect on employee satisfaction, leading to a satisfaction-quality-profit cycle". Our empirical investigation suggests that employee satisfaction is an important consideration for operations managers to boost service quality and customer satisfaction. We provide empirical evidence that employee satisfaction plays it significant role in enhancing the operational performance of organizations in the high-contact service sector. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we develop and present factors that influence professional service operations in firms and compensation structures for professional service providers. We establish professional service influence factors, which we posit will impact agency relationships in professional service firms. That is, we hypothesize that professional service influence factors (PSIFs) will moderate the effect of task programmability and outcome measurability in predicting the use of behavior- or outcome-based compensation schemes (control strategy). Logistic regression is used on data provided by 192 professional service providers in order to examine the impact of the agency variables and moderating factors on control strategies. The results indicate that company- and profession-based factors have moderating effects on task programmability when predicting control strategy. We discuss the implications of our findings.

The literature suggests that supply chain management (SCM) consists of internal practices, which are contained within a firm, and external practices, which cross organizational boundaries integrating a firm with its customers and suppliers. Supplier quality management and customer focus are two QM practices that are also clearly in the domain of SCM. In this study we investigate how these two supply chain management-related quality practices lead to improved performance and examine the practices that precede and mediate those relationships. In doing so, we replicate and extend the relationships among the QM practices and their effects on firm performance suggested in Kaynak [Kaynak, H., 2003. The relationship between total quality management practices and their effects on firm performance.

Supply management, the cornerstone of the integration of industrial supply chains, has evolved as a key research area. Based on quantitative and qualitative investigations of 225 electronics manufacturing firms, we examine the organizational impacts of strategic supply management (SSM) and the contexts of company size, process type, ISO 9000 certification, and quality management (QM) implementation that facilitate such an endeavor. We reveal that SSM is essentially a quality management initiative that requires bilateral efforts for continuous improvement and thus is not associated with the basic requirements of ISO 9000. We find that SSM improves on-time shipments, reduces operational costs, and leads to customer satisfaction and improved business performance. Developed based on contemporary premises in supply chain and QM, this research refines our understanding of the relationships among quality initiatives, SSM, and organizational performance.

The standard aims to evaluate a firm's ability to effectively design, produce, and deliver quality products and services. This version of the standard tries to enhance customer satisfaction by including more top-management involvement and continual improvement. Despite widespread international acceptance, the new standard is surrounded by controversy similar to that surrounding its predecessor, the 1994 version. The literature is clearly divided in its assessment of ISO 9000:2000, which is viewed as either a quality management (QM)-based system or as another paper-driven process that increases risk, uncertainty, and costs. This study utilizes case-based research to address the competing views of the ISO 9000:2000 standard in an attempt to see if a sample of firms in the automotive industry can be positioned within the Miles and Snow [Miles, R.E., Snow, C.C., 1978. Organizational Strategy, Structure and Process. McGraw-Hill, New York] strategic typology. We compare different amounts of quality standard integration and quality assurance in the supply chain of firms with ISO 9000:2000 registration while positing several research propositions.

With a few notable exceptions, there is no guidance in the literature for operations managers trying to understand the role that employee safety at their own or a suppliers could play in quality outcomes. This manuscript takes a first step to rectify this oversight by using cognitive dissonance theory to build a series of propositions that link safety perceptions to quality outcomes. Empirical tests of these propositions provide initial evidence that safety does indeed contribute to quality outcomes in the supply chain. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Understanding Six Sigma first requires providing a conceptual definition and identifying an underlying theory. In this paper we use the grounded theory approach and the scant literature available to propose an initial definition and theory of Six Sigma. Our research argues that although the tools and techniques in Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior approaches to quality management, it provides an organizational structure not previously seen. This emergent structure for quality management helps organizations more rigorously control process improvement activities, while at the same time creating a context that enables problem exploration between disparate organizational members. Although Six Sigma provides benefits over prior approaches to quality management, it also creates new challenges for researchers and practitioners. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Drawing from organizational theories of learning, we build on this research by proposing a model that relates the pattern of supplier use of IT to specific types of supply chain coordination activities and a comprehensive set of organizational benefits. Specifically, we evaluate how two patterns of IT use by suppliers (exploitation and exploration) relate to two specific types of coordination activities with their buyers (operational and strategic coordination), which in turn are posited to promote specific organizational benefits. Using data from 241 first-tier OEM suppliers in the computer industry, our findings show that each pattern of IT use directly promotes a specific type of coordination activity. Although both types of coordination activities are needed to achieve both strategic and operational benefits, we find each coordination activity to be uniquely promoted by a specific pattern of IT use. IT use for exploitation is found to be an antecedent to operational coordination; IT use for exploration is found to be an antecedent to strategic coordination. No crossover between pattern of use and coordination activities is found. Out-findings show that to achieve a complete set of benefits, suppliers must ultimately use IT for both exploration and exploitation. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanism of how the pattern of IT use can result in a comprehensive set of organizational benefits for supplier firms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, our knowledge of what influences SCI is still very limited. Although marketing and management researchers have investigated power and relationship commitment issues between organizations, few have examined their impact on SCI. This paper extends the power-relationship commitment theory established in Western marketing literature and links it with SCI in China, through examining the relationship between power, relationship commitment and the integration between manufacturers and their customers. We propose and empirically test a model using data collected from 617 manufacturing companies in China. The results show that different types of customer power impact manufacturers' relationship commitment in different ways. Expert power, referent power and reward power are important in improving manufacturers' normative relationship commitment, while reward power and coercive power enhance instrumental relationship commitment. We also found that normative relationship commitment had a greater impact on customer integration than instrumental relationship commitment. These findings are interpreted in light of national culture differences between China and the U.S. in terms of power distance and collectivism, which provide a new perspective on SCI.

However, new demands on the supply-chain system require changes to information flow and exchange. We undertake a case study of three automotive supply chains that face such new demands resulting from the introduction of an order-driven supply-chain strategy. We use our case study findings to evaluate the applicability of three different theoretical lenses on the multi-faceted interactions between information, physical flow, and the complex rationales driving supply-chain evolution: the resource-based view (RBV), the concept of complex adaptive systems (CAS), and adaptive structuration theory (AST). We find that each theory has a separate realm of applicability and while complimentary in nature, provides distinct insight on the structural shift in the supply-chain system. More specifically, we find that AST, a theory prominent in the social sciences, provides novel insights to supply-chain research at the firm level, particularly with respect to the difficulties in using IT systems to drive systemic change. It complements both the system-level perspective offered by the complex adaptive systems theory, as well as the concept of dynamic capabilities originating in the resourced-based view. The paper concludes with wider implications for future research in supply and value chain management. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the theoretical lens of Dynamic Capabilities Theory and Resource-Based View, we postulate that online information and process act as resources that result in logistics fulfillment capabilities. These capabilities in turn lead to satisfaction with e-procurement. We estimate our research model using structural equation modeling with survey data collected from 131 purchasing and procurement managers. We empirically examine these linkages by analyzing data collected from procurement managers. Our results indicate strong support for the relationships between information flow process quality, logistics fulfillment quality processes, and e-procurement satisfaction performance. One of the surprising findings of our study is that fulfilled order timeliness has a significantly greater impact on satisfaction than fulfilled order accuracy. This finding points to the increasingly important role that the dimension of time plays in today"s competitive environment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Building on the well-established motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) framework, we posit that knowledge sharing among employees is a function of their MOA to do so. Existing literature suggests that the interaction among motivation, opportunity, and ability drives knowledge-sharing behavior. In contrast, we specify a new model in which the "bottleneck" or constraining factor among the MOA variables determines the degree of knowledge sharing that occurs. This constraining-factor model (CFM) fits the data better than the traditional multiplicative model and reveals a new, qualitatively different portrait of knowledge sharing that resolves some of the puzzles in the previous literature. The CFM provides macro-level insights with respect to how operations managers can improve employee knowledge sharing by focusing on the bottleneck MOA variable. As a result, the CFM can help set strategic directions of related policies. The model emphasizes that, counter to conventional wisdom, the MOA variables should not be addressed independently, but rather in a dynamic and coordinated way. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the importance of strategic partnerships, the process by which social capital accumulates within buyer-supplier relationships and contributes to buyer performance improvements is not well understood. Drawing on social capital theory, we develop a model linking positive relational capital, and its antecedents, supplier integration and supplier closeness, to buyer performance improvements. Further, we hypothesize that structural capital, as reflected in managerial communication and technical exchanges, is also positively related to buyer performance improvements. Using data provided by 111 procurement executives from the United Kingdom, we find support for our hypotheses. The study extends the supply chain management and social capital literature and suggests important implications for both research and practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we view the antecedents of the current state of affairs. In the 1980s services offshoring was a trivial portion of the economy, but the seeds of today's situation were planted then. A combination of U.S. government neglect, foreign government activism, a culture change among business people concerning service processes, technological advances, and cultural relationships among countries have created the specific services offshoring configuration of today.

This research examines the perspectives of eight organizations through interviews with 10 high-ranking supply management executives. The paper first explores the rationale for offshore outsourcing among the organizations studied. Using the tenants of TCE, this paper postulates that fixed costs of establishing the relationship dominate the variable costs of day-to-day transactions, and that organizations will not offshore outsource areas where there is high perceived degree of unmanageable risk. The paper expands on themes provided by TCE and offers some lessons learned, and guidelines for managing and controlling offshore outsourced services relationships. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While the cost-savings from offshoring service work are usually clear, operating at a distance also brings with it certain "invisible costs."

We identify the drivers of these costs. We conclude with recommendations for,controlling or attenuating invisible costs in offshoring service work. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some have claimed that virtually all services that can be electronically transmitted should be offshored due to the extreme labor rate differentials. Relatively little work has actually been offshored to date, making empirical assessment difficult. Here, a normative model of the appropriate role of offshoring is proposed. We present a strategic contingency model, to be viewed at the process level, intimating that firms with the same processes should come to different solutions regarding these decisions.

The evolutionary model of offshoring parallels well-established work in the manufacturing literature to present a sequential view of building organizational competence in offshoring. The implications of the conceptual models have been discussed in a range of propositions that can be viewed as foundations for new inquiry in this research stream. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Although research to date has maintained that these practices are beneficial to the offshoring firm and national economies, by reducing costs and expanding markets, little is known about the longer term effect of offshoring on the rate of innovation of home economies. This paper suggests that offshoring practices have adverse effects on innovation at the national home base. The analysis uses patents in the rare-earth element industry, a high-tech area which is among those that have evolved the furthest towards outsourcing and relocation away from the US and to developing countries. Looking at the rare-earth industry can provide insights in identifying potential long term impacts of offshoring on innovation because many other US industries are likely to adopt similar offshoring strategies.

This consolidation and streamlining of common business functions is also known as insourcing, in-house services, business services, or staff services. While adoption of a shared service structure is viewed by many as an appropriate strategy to pursue, most companies still struggle to devise optimal strategies and to generate adequate returns on investments for their projects, because none of the approaches that are commonly adopted is recognized as universally effective. This paper builds upon the "structure-environment" perspective to uncover configurations of shared services organizations and to explain why and under what circumstances some of these configurations exhibit superior results. The conceptual model proposed challenges the notion of "best practice" and suggests that the effectiveness of a shared services project depends on the degree of complementarity between the "needs" arising from the environment in which a company operates and the specific capabilities developed to address these needs. The theoretical findings are validated empirically through the analysis of a large sample of European firms that recently undertook initiatives in this domain. Four dominant configurations of shared service organizations are uncovered, and their relationship to performance is explored. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We constructed our theoretical model incorporating knowledge management, social exchange, and alliance risk perspectives, and hypothesized that motives to acquire partners' tacit knowledge through offshore outsourcing will affect firm innovation via two forms of control, namely social control and formal control. Our empirical testing, utilizing two subsamples composed of Sino-foreign offshore outsourcing alliances and local outsourcing alliances, respectively, reveals that the motive to acquire outsourcing partner's tacit knowledge and different control mechanisms are significant predictors of incremental and radical innovation outcomes, and that there are some intriguing differences between the Sino-foreign alliances and local alliances.

A review of transaction cost theory and operations management models of service process disaggregation reveals parallels between the how firm boundaries are determined and how certain service process elements can be disaggregated from face-to-face customer contact. This theoretical background is used to identify challenges to the effective offshoring of service processes. The competitive capability literature offers suggestions as to how firms might acquire the internal capabilities required to manage offshore service processes. Propositions are developed on how the standardized transactional infrastructure of enterprise technologies (and the organizational competencies developed by successful enterprise system adopters) may help mitigate the challenges of offshore governance.

Few, if any, of the existing theories provide satisfactory explanation for the rapid growth in this area. We use a model proposed by Sridhar and Balachandran [Sridhar, S.S., Balachandran, B.V. 1997. Incomplete information, task assignment, and managerial control systems. Manage. Sci. 43(6),764-778] to determine the factors that might contribute to this phenomenon. Our analysis reveals that the ability of the vendor to forecast the task environment without bias and to gain sophistication in interpreting contract terms might make the firm indifferent between outsourcing and retaining front-end processes in-house. We validate our findings against the work of Apte and Mason [Apte, U.M., Mason, R.O., 1995. Global disaggregation of information-intensive services. Manage. Sci. 41(7), 12501262], who develop a theoretical framework to identify criteria for companies to select services to be outsourced.

We construct a game-theoretic model of the dynamics of the buyer-supplier interaction in the presence of moral hazard and incomplete contracting. We derive the Minimum Quality Threshold (MQT) below which the provider's output will certainly be inspected. Our findings show that the buyer can pick a level of monitoring and thereby force the provider to exceed the quality level of the MQT in output quality and avoid costly and wasteful inspection. Finally, our model explains why the production of processes that are complex and more prone to errors are actually monitored less by the buyers. We furnish the results of a comprehensive, multi-year, multi-country survey of the efficacy of monitoring in off-shore outsourcing projects and demonstrate strong empirical support for the findings of the model.

Our performance measures comprise sales, profit as percentage of sales, profit/employee and sales/employee over 1999-2004. To measure offshoring, we consider the extent to which these companies have offshored: (1) software development and other IT-related development and maintenance, (2) business processes such as payroll or claims processing, and (3) call centers. We performed cluster analysis using the three corresponding offshoring variables to obtain broad patterns of offshoring. Then we compared the average performance of the companies in different clusters using ANOVA; did a regression analysis of the performance measures against the three offshoring variables; and performed non-parametric correlations within industry sectors. None of these tests indicated any clear link between company performance and the extent of offshoring thus suggesting that further study is needed to understand when to offshore and how best to do it.

Despite this, prior literature has not adequately addressed supplier involvement in radical innovation, nor what the antecedents to increased supplier involvement are. We build and test a conceptual model of the antecedents and new product performance outcomes of supplier involvement in the development of radical innovation by new ventures. Antecedent variables (supplier's specific investments and the new venture's qualification of the supplier's abilities) are drawn from the transaction cost analysis literature. We include new venture's relative power and new venture's level of commitment to the supplier as contingency conditions. We develop a set of hypotheses relating supplier involvement to radical innovation performance, relating the antecedent variables to supplier involvement, and also testing the interaction effects of the two contingency conditions. We gather data from both new ventures and their major suppliers for 173 recent radical innovation projects, and use hierarchical regression analysis to test our hypotheses. We find that the contingency conditions moderate achieved levels of supplier involvement, and also find a direct relationship between achieved level of involvement and performance. We conclude with theoretical contributions and managerial implications. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our study focuses on perceived system misfit with organizational processes in tandem with the availability of system circumvention opportunities. Case study comparisons and controlled experiments are used to support the theoretical unpacking of organizational and technical contingencies and their relationship to shifts in user intentions and variation in work-processing tactics over time. Findings suggest that managers and users may retain strong intentions to circumvent systems in the presence of perceived task-technology misfit. The perceived ease with which this circumvention is attainable factors significantly into the timeframe within which it is attempted, and subsequently impacts the onset of deviation from prescribed practice and anticipated dynamics.

In this paper, we seek to extend the stream of research in supply chain management by systematically investigating the antecedents and performance outcomes of inter-organizational communication. Specifically, inter-organizational communication is proposed as a relational competency that may yield strategic advantages for supply chain partners. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically test a number of hypothesized relationships based on a sample of over 200 United States firms. Our results provide strong support for the notion of inter-organizational communication as a relational competency that enhances buyers' and suppliers' performance. Implications for future research and practice are offered. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We refer to this key activity in process innovation as external technology integration. This paper develops a conceptual framework of external technology integration based on organizational information processing theory and technology management literature. The primary hypothesis underlying the conceptual framework is that external technology integration will be most successful when the level of interaction between the source of the technology and recipient of the technology is appropriately matched, or fit, to the characteristics of the technology to be integrated. The conceptual framework also develops other hypotheses relating to contextual factors that may also influence the success of external technology integration. A cross-sectional survey methodology is employed to test the four hypotheses of the conceptual framework, with the results indicating strong support for the fit hypothesis and general support for the contextual hypotheses. The paper closes with a discussion of the implications of this study for both theory and practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While such bundles are used in offline purchase negotiations, their criticality is heightened in online auctions due to their usual short duration and constrained bidding environment. Despite this importance, little systematic discussion or evaluation has taken place concerning bundling practice, especially as it relates to the individual items included in the bundle, the overall bundle composition, and the resulting supply base and ultimate bundle performance. This study investigates these issues by developing a conceptual model and testing it with a large-scale survey completed by purchasing professionals practicing bundling in B2B online auctions. Results indicate that crafting a more homogeneous bundle is most important in achieving a successful outcome. Furthermore, more complex or difficult-to-specify items do not impact perceived bundle performance, but do influence the supply base that is willing and able to bid on the business.

This paper analyzes the shareholder value effects of setting up industry exchanges, a prominent mechanism used to achieve supply chain integration. Shareholder value effects are estimated by measuring the stock market reaction (abnormal returns) associated with announcements to form or join industry exchanges. We find that abnormal returns from participation in industry exchanges are positive but only marginally significant in the whole sample of 144 firms in 18 exchanges formed during 2000-2001. In the sub-sample of 88 exchange founders who were part of the original announcements to form the exchange, the abnormal market reaction is about 1% and significant. We also find that firms with greater bargaining power and higher process efficiency benefit more from participation in industry exchanges. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We integrate some of those knowledge-based approaches seeking to understand how aspects related to cross-functional orientation, new technologies, and increasing access to information affect manufacturing strategy. In this paper, "know-what" (where to find the needed information) and "know-how" (how to run operations smoothly) are considered key components of organizational knowledge in the process of manufacturing strategy formulation. Assuming that knowledge accumulation may lead to competitive advantage, we propose a model of manufacturing strategy process from a resource-based view perspective. We used a survey to collect field data from 104 companies. The results indicate that cross-functional activities integrate manufacturing knowledge and contribute to the creation of valuable and rare product characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In our field interviews and observations of high-reputation plant managers from 11 manufacturing plants, we found that effective political skill enabled them to influence subordinates in ways that contributed positively to organizational outcomes. Political skill is an interpersonal style that combines social astuteness with the ability to relate well, and otherwise demonstrate situationally appropriate behavior in an engaging way that inspires confidence, trust, and genuiness [Ferris, G.R., Perrewe, P.L.; Anthony, W.P., Gilmore, D.C., 2000. Political skill at work. Organizational Dynamics 28 (4), 25-37]. We observed that effective plant managers possessed a configuration of dispositional traits (self-motivation, sense of humility, and affability), systematically employed interpersonal behaviors (creating accountability, leading by example, and developing trust), and focused on managerial processes (stretch goals, influencing and learning from below, and empowering direct reports). By juxtaposing the political skill and power literatures, we propose a theory of plant manager effectiveness as a combination of political skill and the use of unobtrusive and systemic power to achieve both affective and substantive outcomes.

While the emerging conventional wisdom suggests that the greater the extent to which manufacturers engage in Internet-enabled commerce with downstream business customers the better the performance, we espouse an alternative view. Consistent with the relational view of competitive advantage and contingency theory, we develop a model and a series of hypotheses that specify how various product and market characteristics may influence the nature of the expected positive relationship between e-collaboration and performance. To test the model, we collected data from 50 manufacturers using a Web-based survey. Our partial least squares (PLS) analysis results do indeed support the notion that e-collaboration is related to better operational and business performance. However, we go on to show that the strength of the relationship between e-collaboration and operational performance diminishes as the level of environmental munificence increases. Notably, we found no such moderating effect with respect to the level of product complexity or market variability. Our findings contribute to the operations strategy literature on supply chain relationships in the e-business arena and offer managers a framework for understanding the conditions under which investments in e-collaboration may be more appropriate and therefore more beneficial.

This Study investigates the moderating effects of relational stress on the ability of buyer-initiated cooperative actions to influence a supplier's willingness to invest in technology that will be of benefit to the buyer. Data on 2012 buying situations were collected from Tier 1 suppliers to three U.S. domestic automotive assemblers (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) and three Japanese transplant automotive assemblers (Honda. Nissan, and Toyota) over three consecutive years (2003-2005). The results indicate that (1) buyer-initiated cooperative actions of communication, assistance, and supplier involvement increase a supplier's willingness to invest in technology, (2) the relationship-enhancing effect of buyer assistance increases under high relational stress, while the effectiveness of buyer communication decreases, and (3) that the effect of supplier involvement is not significantly influenced by relational stress levels. Furthermore, we found that supplier relations with Japanese transplant assemblers are characterized by higher levels of cooperative actions, lower levels of relational stress, and higher levels of supplier willingness to invest in technology when compared to those of U.S. domestic assemblers.

While there is a general agreement regarding the positive impact of TQM on performance, there has been less agreement among the academics about the impact of ISO 9000/1994. Perhaps in response to such debate, the new ISO 9001/2000 has appeared purporting to be more in line with the TQM philosophy. As of now, how this 2000 version actually affects performance is yet to be explored. In this study, we compare the implementation of ISO 9000/1994 and ISO 9001/2000 as representing two different efforts to implement quality management practices. We evaluate its impact on company performance with a sample of 713 Spanish industrial companies. We also examine if the 2000 version of ISO is taking us closer to the implementation of TQM. Further, we depart from the past studies methodologically by considering performance as a formative construct rather than a reflective construct. Based oil the mean and covariance structural (MACS) analyses, we conclude that ISO 9001/2000 certified companies do not perform noticeably better than ISO 9000/1994 or non-certified companies. However, we find that ISO 9001/2000 certified companies apply TQM at a higher level than ISO 9000/1994 certified companies, but whether they actually perform better is less clear.

Despite this prominence, anecdotal reports from multiple reputable organizations suggest that many businesses fail to realize the benefits anticipated from their outsourcing initiatives. Motivated by these observations, this study investigates those management practices during the outsourcing process that are key drivers of outsourcing performance. Specifically, detailed data from 198 sourcing executives and managers responsible for outsourcing initiatives are used to investigate the influence that strategic evaluation, contractual completeness, and relationship management practices have on achieving projected outsourcing results. The results offer strong empirical evidence that outsourcing performance is significantly influenced by extensive strategic evaluation and proactive relationship management practices. Moreover, the impact strategic evaluation has on outsourcing performance is not direct, but rather is partially mediated by the relationship between the parties. Finally, the results show that contractual completeness does not distinguish between successful and unsuccessful outsourcing efforts, and can be considered qualifying activity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It offers a new method to evaluate the extent that operations policy serves as a hedge against adverse circumstances. We apply the proposed method to explore how supply chain characteristics affect the responses of airlines to the acute demand fall off after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Results indicate that operational hedging vehicles (fleet standardization, high-fleet utilization, an aircraft ownership policy rather than leasing, and international operations) are more powerful in protecting firms than using financial instruments. The study contributes in guiding managers as to how operations policy can serve as an imperative factor in mitigating exposures to low-end performance levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We begin by reviewing the theoretical foundations of social exchange theory. Next, we use an illustrative multinational business example from a Danish Business Group to demonstrate the complexities of the lock-in situation. Conjectures related to lock-in behaviors are initially developed and then examined by means of a game-theoretic model. The analysis provides a basis for the development of propositions which are examined employing a behavioral experiment. The results indicate that the optimal pricing strategy of the supplier is to lower the price with increasing demand and the optimal investment intensity of the buyer decreases with increasing demand. The paper concludes by presenting directions for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Drawing on high reliability organization theory, multifactor leadership theory and total quality management literature, we develop and test a model for improving patient safety - a critical issue facing hospitals today. Specifically, we hypothesize that improving patient safety begins at the highest level of the organization with a transformational leadership style. This leads to a sequence of linkages whereby transformational leadership has an important relationship with creating a culture of safety, which in turn is associated with the adoption of patient safety initiatives, and ultimately with positive improvements in patient safety outcomes. Using data from a nationwide survey of over 200 hospitals, we use structural equation modeling to provide empirical support for the effectiveness of this patient safety chain model. The results have major implications for enhancing operations in hospital settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Building on the resource-based view, knowledge-based view and strategic choice theory, we develop hypotheses linking two knowledge-c! riven supply chain phenomena (i.e., knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital), innovation-cost strategy, and action to firm-level performance. Using survey and archival data from 489 firms, we found that performance is influenced by how well knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital efforts complement alternative chain strategies. More specifically, each strategy type requires different constellations of knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital to enhance action and create superior firm performance. These results highlight the importance of supply chain phenomena for firm-level performance, and more broadly, the value of supply chains as a competitive weapon in contemporary firms.

It is difficult for reseachers to reach suppliers who have violated SCC, especially within a large sample, because few disclose SCC violations to the public. In this paper, however, we identified 108 non-compliant Chinese apparel and textile suppliers. Through the investigation of these non-compliant suppliers and their compliant peers, this paper tests the impacts of antecedent factors (price pressure, production complexity, and contract duration) and buyer's governance mechanisms (peer-to-peer and buyer-to-supplier) on the likelihood of a supplier's compliance with SCC. While the buyer-to-supplier governance does not show significant effects, the peer-to-peer governance demonstrates the likelihood of supplier's commitment to SCC. This research reveals that if buyer's governance efforts move away from threat and toward cooperation, supplier's compliance with SCC could be more sustainable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Largely absent from the buyer-supplier literature is an in-depth examination of activities that break down trust, and the resulting effect on supplier trust in the buyer. The authors propose and test a model that evaluates psychological contract violations between a buyer and a supplier as a mediating variable of the effect of unethical activities on trust within a partnership. Survey data was collected from 110 tier one suppliers of major corporations in the state of Ohio. Our results show how a supplier's perception of a violation of the psychological contract either partially mediates or fully mediates the relationship between the buyers unethical activity and the suppliers trust in that buyer. We discuss how suppliers may demonstrate bounded ethicality when they overlook perceived unethical behaviors by the buyer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our study applied to manufacturer-distributor dyads in China and used matched survey data (225 paired sample firms) to test our hypotheses. Our hierarchical multivariate regression and semipartial correlation analyses suggest that transactional mechanisms are more effective in restraining opportunism while relational mechanisms are more powerful in improving relationship performance. This performance is improved more significantly when both contracts and relational norms are used jointly than when used separately. Likewise, opportunism is curbed more effectively when both contracts and trust are used jointly than when used individually. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose that in an ES environment of easy information access, competitive success depends, in part, on the policies regulating enterprise information use. To explore this proposition, we examine the efficient use of different types of enterprise information in the realization of strategic performance. Efficient firms will devote fewer resources to information use to achieve the same strategic performance as less efficient firms. We employ data envelopment analysis (DEA) using data collected from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system adopters at two different points in time in order to calculate a measure of efficient information use. This information efficiency metric is validated as a strong predictor of Compustat profitability. Additional analyses suggest that the most efficient users of information tend to emphasize information related to operational excellence. Regardless of information emphasis, however, efficient manufacturers - in contrast to their less efficient counterparts - were more likely to exhibit a better match between the most emphasized type of information and the corresponding dimension of strategic performance.

Our study addresses this research gap. We model firms' abilities to collectively collaborate with suppliers, customers, and internal employee teams in NPD as collaborative competence and examine its impact on project and market performance. Using responses collected from 189 NPD managers, we find empirical evidence for collaborative competence and its differential impact on project and market performance. Specifically, we find that collaborative competence has a direct impact on project performance, but its impact on market performance is indirect, mediated through project performance. The results have significant managerial implications; achieving superior market performance from inter- and intra-organizational involvement is contingent on achieving superior project performance, and companies that fail to achieve desired project performance outcomes will also fail in achieving market performance goals.

This spans the entire time since the beginning of research journals specific to the field. Employing a bibliometric citation/co-citation analysis to investigate the foundations of the discipline enables a robust, quantitative approach to uncovering the evolution of research in OM. The study finds that the intellectual structure of the field made statistically significant changes between the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000s and evolved from a pre-occupation with narrow, tactical topics toward more strategic, macrotopics, including new research methods and techniques. A factor analysis identifies the 12 top knowledge groups in the field and how they change over the decades. Illustrations of the structure of the co-citations representing the field are generated from a spring-embedded algorithm that is an improvement over the standard multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) approach to illustrating the knowledge groups.

Despite its longevity, there is a paucity of studies analyzing the focus concept and its link to performance, especially in health care. This research is aimed at enhancing our understanding of how a focus-based approach to organization redesign in health care affects processes and practices, and what operational, clinical, and financial outcomes result from such a change. The research setting is a single case site within a large medical center for which costs for trauma care used to exceed income. Using a structured framework, we document the design and operation of this physically and organizationally integrated Level I trauma care center and compare it to its preceding operation. Its pre- and post-conversion performance is analyzed using symmetric event windows covering three-year periods before and after the focused hospital unit (FHU) was established. Under a sizable increase in workload, we find no change in mortality, moderate improvement in length of stay, and a large improvement in net operating margins. Surprisingly, the latter stem not from reductions in cost but in sharply increased hospital reimbursements. Previous studies of hospital restructuring involving focused patient populations have not conclusively supported a positive link between focus and outcomes. However, this investigation of a specific FHU suggests, conceptually as well as quantitatively, that focus can be an attractive element in health care system design. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, we investigate how the level of information availability moderates problem solving approach on supply chain performance. We draw on construal level theory from the experimental psychology literature to explain how the problem solving approaches (abstract problem solving approach vs. concrete problem solving approach) contribute to supply chain performance. From this foundation, we run a series of behavioral experiments to test our hypotheses that problem solving approaches and information availability impact supply chain performance as presented in the beer distribution game. A key finding of this study is that individuals who take an abstract problem solving approach are able to perform better than individuals who take a concrete problem solving approach in the context of limited information availability. However, in the context of complete information availability, the impact of both types of problem solving approaches on performance becomes negligible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results are based on a sample of 307 supply chain disruptions announced by publicly traded firms during 1987-1998. Our analysis shows that firms with more slack in their supply chain experience less negative stock market reaction. The extent of business diversification has no significant effect on the stock market reaction. Firms that are more geographically diversified experience a more negative stock market reaction. We find that firms with a high degree of vertical relatedness experience a less negative stock market reaction. These results have important implications on how firms design and operate their supply chains to mitigate the negative effect of supply chain disruptions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. Ail rights reserved.

Further, results collected in a logistics operations (LO) context support a strong positive relationship between this knowledge management process and operational and organizational performance. Importantly, psychometric measures for organizational performance collected from managerial respondents were strongly correlated with secondary financial data for participating firms obtained from Compustat, thus supporting a link about operational performance and hard organizational performance data.

The topic's importance is due to several industry trends currently in place: increase in strategic outsourcing by firms, globalizations of markets, increasing reliance on suppliers for specialized capabilities and innovation, reliance on supply networks for competitive advantage, and emergence of information technologies that make it possible to control and coordinate extended supply chains. This article identifies some important aspects of risk management in supply chains and summarizes the four articles that are in this special issue. This emerging area of research interest deserves considerable attention and it is our hope that the articles in this special issue would spur additional research on this important topic.

Organizations require agility in their supply chains to provide superior value as well as to manage disruption risks and ensure uninterrupted service to customers. Thus the cultivation of agility is approached as a risk management initiative that enables a firm to respond rapidly to marketplace changes, as well as anticipated and actual disruptions in the supply chain. Agility is of value for both risk mitigation and response. This research investigates the impact of two cultural antecedents, market orientation and learning orientation, and three organizational practices, all aimed at augmenting the supply chain agility of a firm. A firm's supply chain agility (FSCA) is defined as the capability of the firm, both internally and in conjunction with its key suppliers and customers, to adapt or respond in a speedy manner to marketplace changes as well as to potential and actual disruptions, contributing to the agility of the extended supply chain. The two cultural antecedents of market and learning orientations are posited to affect the organizational practices of internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility, and eventually impact the firm's supply chain agility. The external flexibility elements considered are volume and mix flexibility. In addition, the specific organizational characteristics and practices exhibited by firms with high levels of supply chain agility are also investigated. Through the use of the structural equation modeling technique, partial least squares (PLS), it is shown that strong linkages exist among the cultural antecedents, the three organizational practices considered, and the firm's supply chain agility. All three organizational practices, internal integration, external integration with key suppliers and customers, and external flexibility are shown to have significant positive impact on the firm's supply chain agility. Market orientation is shown to significantly impact both internal and external supply chain integration, along with the two elements of external flexibility. Learning orientation, on the other hand, is shown to have a strong and direct influence only on the level of internal integration. Firms with high levels of external integration are also shown to have high levels of internal integration, consistent with past research. Internal and external integration efforts are also seen to be unrelated to the levels of external flexibility present. The results serve to establish a set of key drivers for augmenting supply chain agility as a risk management initiative. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is not only true because firms are more exposed to catastrophes, but also the result of investments made in recent years to operate supply chains with fewer human and capital resources, especially inventory. Consequently, there is today less "slack" available in supply chains to deal with catastrophic events. Thus, proactively planning for these types of events should be a priority for supply chain managers. A catastrophic event has a very low probability of occurrence but has significant consequences if it does occur. The goal of this research is to develop a process to proactively plan for catastrophic risk events through an integration of diverse research streams related to the management of risk. In particular, the proposed process builds upon an existing risk analysis framework by incorporating an innovative methodology used by the insurance industry to quantify the risk of multiple types of catastrophic events on key supply chain locations.

The need to reduce the increased level of supply chain vulnerability has been identified as a key research issue in the domain of supply chain management. In this paper, a novel value-focused process engineering methodology for process-based supply chain risk identification is proposed with the aim to increase value to supply chain members and supply chain as a whole.

In China's coastal industrial zones, where most Fortune 500 companies have established their manufacturing bases, local suppliers are facing serious labor turnover problems. High labor turnover rates have caused poor quality, low productivity, and unfilled orders in supply chains. Applying a combination of quantitative techniques to determine the reasons why workers leave China's export factories, this research tries to identify the root causes of job dissatisfaction leading to turnover and provides managerial implications that may assist managers in dealing with labor-related supply chain risks.

Nowadays, quality award models, such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) and the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model, are used as a guide to TQM implementation by a large number of organizations. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of empirical research confirming whether these models clearly reflect the main premises of TQM. The Purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which the EFQM Excellence Model captures the main assumptions involved in the TQM concept, that is, the distinction between technical and social TQM issues, the holistic interpretation of TQM in the firm, and the causal linkage between TQM procedures and organizational performance. Based on responses collected from managers of 446 Spanish companies by means of a structured questionnaire, we find that: (a) social and technical dimensions are embedded in the model; (b) both dimensions are intercorrelated: (c) they jointly enhance results. These findings support the EFQM Excellence Model as an operational framework for TQM, and also reinforce the results obtained in previous studies for the MBNQA, suggesting that quality award models really are TQM frameworks.

However, not all lean implementations have produced such results. Apparently, this effect is moderated by several factors, potentially even to the point of reversal. It is important to increase our understanding of how this might occur. In this paper, we explore how novelty, complexity, instability, and buffering affect the relationship between lean implementation and production costs. An interest in these factors drew us to study the case of Lockheed Martin's production system for the F-22, an extremely complex and innovative product. To build theory, we synthesize our empirical data from the case with other existing theory, such as theories of learning and complexity. Through this analysis, we develop a revised framework that reconceptualizes the effect of lean on production costs and use it to develop 11 propositions to direct further research. Included among these are propositions about how the timing, scale, and extent of lean implementation call regulate the benefits of lean. Furthermore, when the objective of lean is construed as the provision of value, we propose that this value is all emergent property of a complex process, different from the mere sum of the values provided by its constituent tasks. Therefore, the elimination of tasks will not guarantee cost reduction, and lean may provide even greater value by incorporating some aspects of agile manufacturing. Overall, we develop a fuller range of the effects of lean practices on production costs and illuminate how operations managers might control key variables to draw greater benefits from lean implementation.

This paper argues that neither transaction cost economics nor the resource-based view alone can fully explain the complexities of outsourcing. A review and critique of these theories as a means of understanding the complexities of outsourcing is presented. A prescriptive framework for outsourcing evaluation is presented, which was developed from integrating TCE and the RBV, and carrying out in-depth case Study research in a number of organizations. The research findings emphasize the utility of integrating TCE and the RBV, and highlight the importance of operations management concept.; such as performance management, operations strategy, business improvement and process redesign to the study of outsourcing. However, the findings have shown that these theories should be applied with caution due to contradictory prescriptions in some instances. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purchase price of materials and components for the new product provides only part of the picture for design and sourcing decisions. All-encompassing analyses of cost and performance, such as total cost of ownership, are extraordinarily difficult to implement because they are demanding in terms of time, data and cooperation. We study monetary quantification of points of difference, which enables an NPD team to base its decisions instead on more focused, strategically-pertinent analyses of costs and performance. We propose a substantive model of its antecedents and consequences. We then test this model with data from matched samples of 144 project leaders and 144 cost analysts who participated in the same NPD projects. Using structural equation modeling, we also test hypothesized differences in perspectives between project leaders and cost analysts. Results demonstrate the pivotal role of monetary quantification of points of difference among the sourcing alternatives being considered, especially for cost analysts. Results also demonstrate that Decision justification to senior management drives the NPD team's decision-making process. Finally, monetary quantification of points of difference leads to Uncertainty Reduction, which is found to be the primary antecedent of the judged success of applying analysis of cost and performance.

The results show that upstream complexity. internal manufacturing complexity, and downstream complexity all have a negative impact on manufacturing plant performance. Furthermore, supply chain characteristics that drive dynamic complexity are shown to have a greater impact on performance than those that drive only detail complexity. In addition to providing a definition and empirical test of supply chain complexity, the study serves to link the systems complexity literature to the prescriptions found in the flexibility and lean production literatures. Finally, this research establishes a base from which to extend previous work linking operations strategy to organization design [Flynn, B.B., Flynn, E.J., 1999.

From this, propositions on the integration and evolution of operation and human resource management practices associated with the lean production concept are developed. Using 24 years of data on the use of seven core OM and HRM practices in British manufacturing firms, the potential link between integration in the use of practices and productivity is tested. In each year, three latent clusters are identified via ordered restricted latent class models; the cluster that consistently makes a more integrated use of practices outperforms the others. Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of the data permits modeling the growth curves of each practice in the sample, recognizing any similarity in growth and investigating whether or not an early integration in adoption of practices is associated with higher final productivity. The results show that pioneers are more productive, thus suggesting that the head start in integrating core OM and HRM practices associated with the lean production concept has paid off.

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research regarding learning capabilities between business partners in a cross-border setting. This study takes the approach to integrate customer value literature into interorganizational learning theory and adopts the often-neglected theoretical perspective of transaction value by contextualizing inter-firm collaboration in terms of relationship learning and value co-creation viewed by both the buyers and sellers in one single study. Through the development of a conceptual framework that examines how global environmental and inter-organizational conditions influence learning capabilities, the study investigates how relationship learning influences relationship value for both supplying and buying firms. Using a survey of 126 cross-border dyads in the industrial chemical, packaging, consumer durable, and apparel industries, the authors show how relationship learning is valued by both buyers and suppliers, and how it is critical when viewing the "supplier as a customer." The results indicate the strategic nature of relationship learning in maintaining cross-border business-to-business relationships. Simultaneously, the findings provide evidence that cultural distance is not a significant influence on the firm's propensity to share knowledge with its global partners. It helps advance our understanding of the significance of cultural-pollination in the era of globalization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While case studies have documented how supplier innovation can benefit a manufacturer, this relationship has not been empirically validated, nor have contingencies been explored. Using organizational learning theory we posit that the link between supplier innovativeness and manufacturer performance is moderated by the "fit" between the learning styles of the manufacturer and supplier. We empirically test our hypotheses using hierarchical linear modeling of survey responses from 148 manufacturers concerning 592 suppliers. Results indicate that supplier innovativeness has positive impacts on multiple dimensions of manufacturer performance. Results show that when the outsourced activity involves low levels of design responsibility by the supplier, it is more beneficial for the two partners to have contrasting learning styles. However, when the outsourced activity is design-intensive, it is more beneficial to have a supplier with an explorative learning style. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Research and practice have shown that buyer-supplier relationships benefit when partners to the relationship exhibit a long-term orientation. The extant literature suggests that a buyer's trust of a supplier and the supplier's performance affect the buyer's long-term orientation toward the relationship. We propose that the relative effects of trust and performance on long-term orientation are moderated by culture - specifically the individualism/collectivism dimension. Hypotheses are tested on data from two individualist and two collectivist cultures, using responses from over 600 purchasing professionals in the United States, Anglo-phone Canada, Francophone Canada and Mexico.

A series of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) were used to analyze survey data from 195 respondents. The results show that in technologically turbulent environments, the relationships between the firm's perceived usefulness and ease of use and the firm's intention to use a supply chain technology are stronger. The study also finds that the relationship between the firm's intention to use a supply chain technology and the implementation of the technology is weaker in firms with greater technological breadth.

However, in fast changing business contexts, the contextual contingencies do not present ideal conditions for practicing purely relational or transactional approach. Understanding the dynamic of key contextual factors and their effects on a firm's resource capabilities and inter-organizational power structure is crucial for identifying the appropriate governance structure over time. In this paper we explore the exchanges between an OEM and five of its strategic suppliers that operate in high-end, short product life cycle motorbike industry, to understand the key contextual factors and the relationships among business context, governance structure, and exchange practices in a dyadic context. It is observed that firms deviate from the conventional choices of either transactional or relational governance to a combination of contractual and relational aspects to make the governance structure effective. Based on case studies, a theoretical framework is proposed to explain the rationale, feasibility and effectiveness of combining contractual and relational aspects in different contexts. The framework suggests that the degree of strategic interdependence between the trading partners fundamentally drives the effectiveness of governance structure and exchange practices.

The results of a survey of 131 firms suggest that the dimensions of institutional pressures (i.e., normative, mimetic, and coercive pressures) have differential effects on eSCM adoption intention. While mimetic pressures are not related to eSCM adoption intention, normative and coercive pressures are positively associated with eSCM adoption intention. In addition, organizational culture (i.e., flexibility orientation and control orientation) plays different roles in the relationships between these three dimensions of institutional pressures and eSCM adoption intention. While flexibility orientation negatively moderates the effects of coercive pressures and positively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures, control orientation positively moderates the effects of coercive and normative pressures and negatively moderates the effects of mimetic pressures. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Drawing on theoretical perspectives from the psychological ownership literature, we examine the impact of project manager (PM) task self-efficacy and perceptions of project work-planning difficulty on resource sharing behaviors. In this study we use a laboratory experiment involving practicing PMs to elicit work assignments for their subordinate team-members across a series of predefined projects. We control for the difficulty of these assignment tasks and follow-up by inquiring into the willingness of the PMs to share human resources that they've assigned to work in these projects. The results from the experiment involving 161 professional PMs suggest that difficulty in project work-planning in general has a significant impact on sharing behaviors. Consistent with the implications of psychological ownership theory, this relationship is significantly moderated by project managers' task self-efficacy. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Drawing from the theoretical grounding of transaction cost economics, personality trait theory, and contingency theory, we proposed three distinct perspectives on opportunism mitigation in buyer-supplier relationships: (1) organizationalist, (2) individualist, and (3) interactionist, where relational norms, agent cooperativeness, and the interaction between them, respectively, serve as the key predictors in these three perspectives. The results of replicated experiments indicated that relational norms and agent cooperativeness interact with each other in mitigating opportunism and that the interactionist perspective yielded the highest explained variance in opportunism. This suggests that the interactionist perspective, a multi-level theoretical lens encompassing the dynamic interplay between organization-level and individual-level factors, was a more complete model in explaining opportunism than either the organizationalist or individualist perspectives. The consensus which emerged from post-experimental interviews of purchasing professionals is that agent personalities play an important role in buyer-supplier relationships. Some purchasing professionals had observed that uncooperative agents or personnel turnover in the boundary-spanning functions can substantially undermine even established relational exchanges. These qualitative findings are in line with our theoretical arguments and experimental outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Drawing upon March's (1991) notions of exploration and exploitation, an ambidextrous supply chain strategy is conceptualized as a simultaneous pursuit of both explorative and exploitative supply chain practices. We operationalize this concept as a second-order latent construct that captures the co-variation between exploration and exploitation within the context of a manufacturer's supply chain management strategy. Using survey-based data gathered from 174 U.S. manufacturers, we find that an ambidextrous supply chain strategy coincides with combinative competitive capabilities and business performance. Our empirical finding contradicts conventional wisdom that argues for tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. Instead, our empirical results are in line with an emerging complementarity view advocating that supply chain managers build practices to gain operational efficiency while simultaneously searching for opportunities to gain operational advantages. In addition, we provide insights regarding the role of combinative capabilities in mediating the relationship between an ambidextrous supply chain strategy and business performance.

We examine the market reaction to two categories of environmental performance. The first category includes 417 announcements of Corporate Environmental Initiatives (CEIs) that provide information about self-reported corporate efforts to avoid, mitigate, or offset the environmental impacts of the firm's products, services, or processes. The second category includes 363 announcements of Environmental Awards and Certifications (EACs) that provide information about recognition granted by third-parties specifically for environmental performance. Although the market does not react significantly to the aggregated CEI and EAC announcements, we find statistically significant market reactions for certain CEI and EAC subcategories. Specifically, announcements of philanthropic gifts for environmental causes are associated with significant positive market reaction, voluntary emission reductions are associated with significant negative market reaction, and ISO 14001 certifications are associated with significant positive market reaction. The difference between the market reactions to the CEI and EAC categories is statistically insignificant. Overall, the market is selective in reacting to announcements of environmental performance with certain types of announcements even valued negatively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigate the link between the innovation task analyzability and the richness of communications channels used in network arrangements and the link between task analyzability and ties and project development time. We investigated the links based on the data collected from 372 respondents representing ninety three different innovation-driven horizontal networks. The results of structural equation modeling reveal a negative link from task analyzability to communication channel richness and a positive link from communication channel richness to ties. Communication channel richness was found to partially mediate the influence that task analyzability has on both NPD project outcomes of ties and development time. The implications of our results for theory and practice are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V

This study examines the relationship between JIT manufacturing practices and performance outcomes by means of meta-analysis of correlations approach. Based on an in-depth analysis of literature spanning from 1992 to 2008, the results of this meta-analytic investigation support a positive relationship between JIT manufacturing practices and aggregate performance. However, the findings suggest that not all individual JIT practices are associated with all types of performance outcomes. This study highlights the JIT practices that have the greatest impact on individual performance outcomes and emphasizes the role of moderating factors in the relationship between JIT practices and performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and directions for future theory building in JIT are presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model is empirically examined in the context of Six Sigma black belt projects. New scales are developed to measure explicit- and tacit-knowledge-creation practices in process improvement. Data is gathered via a cross-sectional sample, and the hypotheses are tested using hierarchical regression. Our results support the notion that knowledge-creation practices influence the success of process improvement projects. Specifically, the inclusion of softer, people-oriented practices for capturing tacit knowledge explains a significant amount of variance in project success, as much as the more analytically focused practices that capture explicit knowledge. This research offers practical insights about the influence of practices that project managers use to create new knowledge by capturing explicit and tacit knowledge, and seeks to advance theoretical understanding of process improvement.

In large, complex projects (or programs), a manager cannot see the entire "territory" between project start and completion and therefore must rely on models or "maps" to support planning and decisions. When it comes to planning and coordinating work, project managers commonly use a variety of process model views such as flowcharts. Gantt charts, responsibility assignment matrices, and narrative descriptions. However, these views may not contain the right information to best support the purpose or decision at hand. This paper investigates the fit between model views (a kind of technology) and the managerial decisions (a kind of task) they support. Through analysis of the literature and case study data, this research identifies: (1) a set of 28 purposes for which managers draw upon process models for decision support, (2) a set of 15 views of process models, and (3) a set of 56 information attributes involved in supporting the purposes and provided by the views. The paper develops new measures of the sufficiency and extraneousness of the attributes for each purpose and view. Analysis of the evidence suggests substantial misalignment between managers' purposes and tools. Drawing on task-technology fit theory, the paper discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of these results and contributes a new construct, purpose-view alignment, which may help explain project success in future studies. The paper also presents insights for researchers and managers on how to develop customized views that are more suitable for particular managerial tasks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we contribute to the resolution of this debate by using a total effects approach within the contingency perspective. We propose a culture-quality system design-outcomes framework for TQM implementation. We then use this framework to study the differences in total effects relationships among TQM constructs across four contingencies, firm size, TQM duration, unionization, and industry type. Data from a sample of 394 plants (SIC codes 20 through 39) are used to test the validity of our contingency model. Our results revealed that firm size, TQM duration, and industry type moderate the influence of total effects of culture (top management commitment, customer focus, and trust) on final outcomes (process quality, product quality, and customer satisfaction). These contingencies also moderate the influence of total effects of quality system design (design management, training, empowerment, quality information usage, supplier quality management, and process quality management) on final outcomes. The strongest contributor to variation in total effects across groups was industry type, followed by size and then TQM duration. To a lesser extent, unionization was a moderator in total effects relationships. These findings uniquely contribute to the emerging contingency theory of TQM implementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This research steps back from these studies and investigates the exchange of ideas within Operations Management journals and between other management disciplines (Management, Marketing, and Finance) during the last decade (1998-2007). Journal citation metrics provide a measure for the exchange of scholarly ideas. Operations Management (OM) journals show a willingness to cross-pollinate ideas with other management disciplines. But, they also tend to have a higher level of self citations and lower level of within discipline citation exchanges when compared to other management disciplines. As a result, Operations Management journals may reflect methodological silos in the field that could potentially dampen scholarly exchange. In general, increasing the diversity of scholarly exchanges within Operations Management, and conducting more cross-disciplinary research with other management disciples should improve the scholarly development of Operations Management.

However, examinations of culture in services offshoring to date have largely been confined to the relatively coarse concept of aggregate cultural differences between the home and host countries. We propose that specific cultural attributes are more closely aligned with successful service provision. We empirically examine our theoretical development of service cultural alignment and investigate the impact of cultural dimensions on the location of service offshoring projects. In addition, we examine whether Western and Asian firms have different cultural preferences in terms of the location of services offshoring projects. We find that host countries with lower levels of Hofstede's uncertainty avoidance as well as higher levels of individualism and power distance are able to attract greater numbers of service offshoring projects, even after controlling for macroeconomic, linguistic, and risk-related factors. We did not find that Western and Asian firms have different cultural preferences in this regard. We discuss implications of the findings with respect to theory, managerial practice, and governmental policy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the world becomes flat and boundaries break down, manufacturers need to understand the proper role of culture in order to obtain competitive advantage. Thus, the current study conducts a multilevel investigation of the impact of eight national and organizational culture dimensions (according to GLOBE framework) on manufacturing performance. An ANOVA comparison of 189 manufacturing plants between Eastern (Japan and South Korea) and Western (Germany, United States, Finland, and Sweden) countries indicates that organizational culture inside plants differs in three dimensions (power distance, future orientation, and performance orientation). Hierarchical Linear Modeling analysis further suggests that organizational culture has more of an effect on manufacturing performance than national culture or the fit between them. In addition, Country Developmental Indexes, both Economic and Infrastructural, do not impact manufacturing performance, reinforcing our conclusion about the weak influence of the national level factors on manufacturing performance. In an era of globalization, these results have practical implications for organizations expanding across national boundaries by developing an internal organizational culture consistent with high performance manufacturing.

Hypotheses are developed and tested based on the cultural concept of individualism/collectivism, the theory of performance frontiers, and the extent of economic development. More specifically, data collected from 639 manufacturing plants in nine countries are used to first assess the influence of the cultural trait of individualism/collectivism on the extent of investment in structural assets (specifically: physical and capital-based) and infrastructural assets (specifically: team-based methods and improvement programs). Second, the influence of the extent of economic development on these investment factors is measured. Third, evidence is provided supportive of the theory of performance frontiers, and the nature of resource investments in the context of the cultural construct of individualism/collectivism. And fourth, support is provided for the efficacy of this theory, as well as for its compatibility and association with the resource-based view of the firm. Overall, this study makes important contributions to both theory and practice, and provides evidence for the role played by the cultural characteristic of individualism/collectivism in determining plant level investment outcomes in emerging Asian economies.

Yet quality problems in China have raised concerns among managers and researchers as to how to assure product quality from Asian facilities. Implementing quality management practices may accomplish this, but such practices assume specific cultural values exist in certain Asian cultures. Using global manufacturing and cultural data, this study examines if cultural values in Asian and non-Asian countries moderate how effective quality management practices are at improving quality performance. Through the use of multilevel modeling, differences in quality management effectiveness are found among the East Asian cultures of China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Moreover, this study finds that specific cultural dimensions are statistically related to quality management effectiveness. The results of this study will assist managers in devising plans to assure higher quality from East Asian facilities and in predicting where problems may occur in other countries around the world.

The aim of this paper is to identify factors that facilitate and inhibit supplier integration in the context of the Chinese automotive industry. An inductive approach based on grounded theory was chosen as the research methodology, where data was collected through 30 detailed case interviews with subsidiaries of foreign automotive companies operating in China. The results indicate that buyer-side leadership is an important antecedent for building motivation, trust, and commitment among suppliers and for shaping their mindsets. This, in turn, facilitates strategic alignment and enables suppliers to build collaborative capabilities, which are finally shown to be a key enabler for successful supplier integration.

Three aspects of China's institutional environment are salient: legal protection, government support, and the importance of guanxi (interpersonal relationships). This study uses structural equation modeling to analyze data collected from 398 Chinese manufacturing companies. Government support and importance of guanxi significantly affect trust, which subsequently influences two elements of information integration, namely, information sharing and collaborative planning. Furthermore, the importance of guanxi has a direct, positive impact on information sharing, and government support has a direct, positive effect on both information sharing and collaborative planning.

In particular, we conceptually argue and empirically confirm the links between learning intent, capability enhancement, governance mode, and overall innovativeness from the perspective of local suppliers in offshore OEM cooperation in China as well as the influence of local business culture within these links. We address two issues: (1) offshore OEM cooperation can be a unique opportunity for local suppliers with strong intent to learn from foreign buyers for capability enhancement and (2) the moderating effects of trust and contact as two distinctive governance modes. Addressing the two issues, we make two specific contributions to the research on inter-firm cooperation, both of which derive from the often-neglected theoretical lens of transaction value. Our general contribution lies in the extension of the transaction value perspective by specifying its dual tenets of inter-firm co-specialization and shared-trust as the central theme of inter-firm cooperation to complement the transaction cost economics and also contextualize the research on inter-firm cooperation in terms of different partners' perspectives as well as different governance modes.

However, some studies reverse this causal ordering, arguing that the performance gains attributed to prior relational activity predict the strength of the dyadic relationship in future time periods. While supported, both of these perspectives on relationship strength/performance dynamics are incomplete, as the research studies are only cross-sectional snapshots of the phenomenon. We remedy this gap in the existing literature by examining the dynamic cyclical linkage between relationship strength and performance of a buyer-supplier relationship in a longitudinal setting, using a relationship strength-performance spiral model. Results of testing a multiyear sample of 323 buyer-supplier relationships in the construction industry indicate not only that relationships tend to spiral positively following relationship initiation, but also that positive relationship spirals will self-correct following multiple associations of alternating increases. These findings advance theory on buyer-supplier relationships, and provide insight for companies looking to improve supply chain outcomes through superior relationship management.

However, it is unclear if collaborative relationships provide benefits that compensate for the additional expense associated with such relationships. Further, it is unclear what factors promote successful collaborations. This research examines collaborative relationships in two separate studies using structural equation modeling: one study examines buyers' perceptions and the second study examines suppliers' perceptions. The two studies are then compared using invariance testing in order to determine economic and relational factors that drive satisfaction and performance from each party's perspective. Results show that collaborative activities, such as information sharing, joint relationship effort, and dedicated investments lead to trust and commitment. Trust and commitment, in turn, lead to improved satisfaction and performance. Results from the two independent studies exhibit similarities and differences; while the conceptual model is highly similar, certain paths vary in their significance and/or their importance across buyer and supplier firms such that buyers focus more on relationship outcomes while suppliers look to safeguard their transaction specific investments through information sharing and joint relationship effort. Managerial and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a buyer-supplier-supplier relationship triad, the buyer, as the contracting entity, influences the suppliers' behaviors and the relationship between them. By considering the relationships in such a triad, we are able to gain a richer and more realistic perspective of buyer-supplier relationships. In this study, our goal is to examine supplier-supplier relationships in buyer-supplier-supplier triads, focusing on how such relationships impact the supplier performance. We frame the supplier-supplier relationship as co-opetition-one in which competing suppliers work together to meet the buyer's requirements. We investigate the role of the buyer on such relationships, and how the buyer and co-opetitive supplier-supplier relationships affect supplier performance. We find mixed empirical support for our hypotheses. However, we are able to demonstrate the dynamics of supplier-supplier co-opetition in the buyer-supplier-supplier triad. We point out the need for further studies in this area. Published by Elsevier B.V.

While the purported goal of outsourcing in supply chains is to derive a competitive advantage, it is not clear whether the Outsourcing decisions of firms are always strategically aligned with their overall competitive strategy. In this paper we evaluate the degree of congruence (fit or alignment) between a firm's outsourcing drivers and its competitive priorities and assess the impact of congruence on both supply chain performance and business performance, using empirical data collected from manufacturing business units operating in the United States. We find Outsourcing congruence across all five competitive priorities to be positively and significantly related to supply chain performance. We also find the level of supply chain performance in a firm to be positively and significantly associated with the firm's business performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the research literature is unclear about the extent and scope of the impact of IT use on plant operations. This study examines the impact of IT use on the structure, practices, and performance of manufacturing plants. Drawing on information systems and operations management literature, the study differentiates between plant IT use (i) at the process level. (ii) due to internal process integration, and (iii) due to customer and supplier collaboration, labeled as process intelligence, integration intelligence, and collaboration intelligence, respectively. The study also accounts for intelligence gathering due to statistical process control (SPC) practices. The proposed impacts of IT use are examined using data from a study sample of manufacturing plants from electronics, machinery and transportation component industries. Overall, the evidence suggests that SPC has a broader and more significant impact on many aspects of plant operations than the individual dimensions of IT use. However, the three dimensions of IT use do exhibit distinct effects on plant structure, practices, and performance. Process intelligence tends to be associated with plant size and productivity, while integration intelligence and collaboration intelligence tend to be associated with work practices related to increased organizational decentralization and a flexible technology focus.

Theoretically, this relationship is supported by the relationship between institutional theory (stakeholder pressure) and the dimensions of dynamic capabilities in resource-based theory. We investigate this relationship within the Spanish automotive industry. The theoretical contribution of this paper focuses on further supporting the relationship between stakeholder and resource-based theory as complementary theoretical frameworks. The practical implications focus on whether or not training should be integrated in order to help in the adoption of particular environmental practices, which in this study are represented by environmentally oriented reverse logistics practices.

Results from firm-level analyses suggest that the profitability benefits of supply chain relationships are captured predominantly by downstream chain members, whereas cash cycle benefits are realized throughout the supply chain. Firm-level tests also reveal that chain members' financial performance varies systematically with measures of downstream bargaining power, downstream relationship duration, and degree of supply consolidation. The study's chain- and firm-level analyses employ data extracted from sample firms' publicly available financial reports, including their major customer disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 131 (1997) and 14 (1976).

This meta-analytic review assesses the generalizability, of the relationships between NPD speed and 17 of its antecedents to provide a better understanding of the salient and cross-situationally consistent factors that affect NPD speed. We grouped the antecedents into four categories of strategy, project, process, and team, and found that process and team characteristics are more generalizable and cross-situationally consistent determinants of NPD speed than strategy and project characteristics. We also conducted subgroup analyses and found that research method variables, such as level of analysis, source of data, and measurement of speed, moderate the relationships between NPD speed and its antecedents. We apply the study's findings to assess several models of NPD speed, such as the balanced model of product development, the strategic orientation and organizational capability model, the compression vs. the experiential model, the centrifugal and centripetal model, and the product development cycle time model. We also discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process through which buyers make decisions in the face of these risks, however, has not been explored. Despite research highlighting the importance of behavioral approaches to risk. there is limited research that applies these views of risk in the supply chain literature. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on behavioral risk theory to investigate the causal relationships amongst situation, representations of risk, and decision-making within the purchasing domain. We operationalize and explore the relationship between three representations of supply disruption risk: magnitude of supply disruption, probability of supply disruption, and overall supply disruption risk. Additionally, we draw on exchange theories to identify product and market factors that impact buyers' perceptions of the probability and magnitude of supply disruption. Finally, we look at how representations of risk affect the decision to seek alternative sources of supply. We test our model using data collected from 223 purchasing managers and buyers of direct materials. Our results show that both the probability and the magnitude of supply disruption are important to buyers' overall perceptions of supply disruption risk. We also find that product and market situational factors impact perceptions of risk, but they are best understood through their impact on perceptions of probability and magnitude. Finally, we find that decisions are based on assessments of overall risk. These findings provide insight into the decision-making process and show that all three representations of risk are necessary for fully understanding risky decision-making with respect to supply disruptions.

The previous research is inconsistent in its findings about the relationship between SCI and performance. We attribute this inconsistency to incomplete definitions of SCI, in particular, the tendency to focus on customer and supplier integration only, excluding the important central link of internal integration. We study the relationship between three dimensions of SCI, operational and business performance, from both a contingency and a configuration perspective. In applying the contingency approach, hierarchical regression was used to determine the impact of individual SCI dimensions (customer, supplier and internal integration) and their interactions on performance. In the configuration approach, cluster analysis was used to develop patterns of SCI, which were analyzed in terms of SCI strength and balance. Analysis of variance was used to examine the relationship between SCI pattern and performance. The findings of both the contingency and configuration approach indicated that SCI was related to both operational and business performance. Furthermore, the results indicated that internal and customer integration were more strongly related to improving performance than supplier integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper develops a model of commitment-gaining success that is based on intra-organizational influence theory. The model also includes project payback, customer pressure, government regulation, top management support and the project champion's position in the organizational hierarchy. The model was tested using survey data from 241 environmental professionals describing their attempts to gain the buy-in of purchasing managers, operations managers, industrial engineers and others for environmental projects. The results (obtained from hierarchical regression analysis) show that intra-organizational commitment is positively associated with the project champion's influence behavior-in particular, the champion's use of three influence tactics (inspirational appeals, consultation and rational persuasion) and avoidance of a fourth tactic (ingratiation). Commitment is also positively associated with project payback and with top management support for the environment and negatively associated with environmental regulation. The paper contributes to the OM knowledge base on environmental project implementation by bringing new theory to bear on the topic, by focusing on individual-level, rather than organization-level, variables and by taking a confirmatory, large sample approach which complements extant exploratory research. In addition, the paper contributes to the OM field by evaluating various antecedents to cross-functional integration. The results also provide specific guidance to those who champion environmental projects within their companies. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

As with other health information technology (IT) performance studies, literature shows conflicting results regarding the CPOE-performance relationship. By adopting a more nuanced perspective and employing not just adoption but extent of use of CPOE, we first examine whether or not CPOE use improves patient satisfaction. Next, given that CPOEs are implemented in the backdrop of other hospital IT infrastructure, we examine how IT infrastructure impacts the relationship between CPOE use and satisfaction, testing both a complementary and substitution perspective. Finally, we examine the differential impact of CPOE use between academic and non-academic hospitals. Using data from 806 hospitals nationwide, we find a positive relationship between extent of CPOE use and patient satisfaction. Contrary to extant research, our results suggest this relationship is stronger in non-academic hospitals. We also find evidence that a hospital's IT infrastructure substitutes for CPOE use in its effect on patient satisfaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Social dilemmas are often observed in operational processes involving teamwork, such as developing new products or implementing total quality programs. The extent to which an employee cooperates with others is driven not only by material incentives but also by social preferences: individuals have an interest in the welfare of others as well as their own. Two known social preferences are status and relationship maintenance. Multiple studies have shown that status seeking leads team members to compete more whereas relationship building leads them to cooperate more. The question remains of whether these two preferences can coexist and complement one another (as when status seeking triggers effort and relationship building encourages cooperation) or whether they are at odds. In this experimental study we demonstrate that these two social preferences hinder one another: status reduces the collaboration benefit from relationships, and increases only individual, but not collaborative, effort. These results suggest that managerial interventions that promote status seeking and relationship building behavior cannot easily be used simultaneously when motivating teams to perform in situations involving social dilemmas.

These supplier-supplier relations may constitute a missing link between the traditional analysis of the dyadic and the network level of analysis that are often treated separately. This paper explores the interplay of the supplier-supplier and network of analysis by focusing on the inherent tension between cooperation and competition, using a multiple case study design in the Japanese and German automobile industries. It is argued that the buyer is able to exert influence not only on the coopetition level, so within "horizontal supply chain relations," but that the coopetitive tension in the overall network can in fact be managed through the active establishment and maintenance of such relations.

However, research into diversification, product platforms, and other issues related to product portfolio complexity has often produced inconsistent guidance. This situation is at least partially attributable to an incomplete definition of portfolio complexity, and to corresponding limitations of theories applied to date. To address these limitations, we define product portfolio complexity as a design state manifested by the multiplicity, diversity, and interrelatedness of products within the portfolio. We conceptually establish the three-dimensional nature of complexity and present a model to provide insights into how each dimension impacts operational performance. As an extension to prior theoretical perspectives, the model explicitly addresses the roles of organizational learning and the character of fixed assets (utilization and flexibility) as mediator and moderator of product portfolio architectural complexity's effects, respectively. We also incorporate the principle of diminishing returns to address potential non-linearities in the proposed relationships. Prior theories and research studies have neglected these issues. We conclude by discussing useful perspectives with which to view the model, and by presenting measures of portfolio complexity and approaches for testing the propositions developed herein.

Specifically, it examines the relationship between an operations glitch (order fulfillment delay) and subsequent shopping behavior for previously loyal customers in an online retailing environment. Using archival data from a moderate-sized online retailer of printed material, this study employs expectancy disconfirmation and distributive justice theories to empirically show that adverse post-glitch reactions are seen in several dimensions of customer shopping behavior - order frequency and order size decrease, while customer anxiety level increases. The study thus demonstrates that online retailers need to deliver on order fulfillment promises, since a failure to live up to these promises can be detrimental. This study is unique in that, unlike previous studies on order fulfillment in online retailing investigating the tie between fulfillment success and future behavior, we examine the repercussions of order fulfillment failures upon future purchase behavior.

While product safety isn't a new topic, the effect of the global supply chain in creating or exacerbating safety risks and vulnerabilities is both timely and relevant. In this essay we focus on how the field of operations management can provide fresh perspectives and insights in addressing the challenges of product safety and security in the global supply chain. We first examine the product safety issues and challenges that arise in five industries that are increasingly globalizing their supply chains: food, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, consumer products and automobiles. We describe four areas where operations management theory and methodologies can provide fresh insights and innovative solutions in addressing these problems: regulation and standards, product lifecycle management, traceability and recall management, and supplier relationships.

This research develops a framework to examine the threat of potential disruptions on supply chain processes and focuses on potential mitigation and supply chain design strategies that can be implemented to mitigate this risk. The framework was developed by integrating three theoretical perspectives-normal accident theory, high reliability theory, and situational crime prevention. The research uses a multi-method approach to identify key safety and security initiatives (process management, information sharing, and supply chain partner and service provider relationship management) that can be implemented and the conditions under which each initiative is best suited. The research results illustrate that the depth and breadth of security initiatives depends on top management mindfulness, operational complexity, product risk, and coupling. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If so, what factors influence the quality risk? Progress addressing these deceptively simple questions has been hindered by the challenges associated with (1) difficulties in controlling for a wide range of factors that may potentially affect quality risk in offshore manufacturing and (2) the lack of available measures that are consistent across geographic regions. This paper contributes to the academic discourse by empirically assessing differences in quality risk across domestic and offshore plants in a setting that naturally controls for many confounding factors. Specifically, we employ a sample of 30 pairs of regulated drug manufacturing plants in the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico matched both by parent firm and by product standard industrial code (SIC). Using a plant-level measure of quality risk that is measurement invariant, our findings indicate that Puerto Rican plants operate with a significantly higher quality risk than matching plants operated by the same firm located in the mainland U.S., on average. This finding persists above and beyond potentially important factors, such as geographic distance and the local population's general and industry-specific skills. Thus, challenges related to the transfer and maintenance of the knowledge required to operate with a low quality risk across non-geographic distance are left as the most plausible explanatory factors. Practically, our research highlights the need for manufacturing firms to carefully consider increased quality risk associated with the offshoring of production, particularly with regard to process-sensitive products like drugs. From a policy standpoint, our study highlights the need for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continue to intensify its inspection focus on international manufacturing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we study what factors influence the number of accidents that have occurred in the past three and a half years in 78 Dutch warehouses. Based on prior research in (behavioral) operations management, safety management, and organizational behavior, we identify hazard reducing systems (HRS), safety-specific transformational leadership (SSTL), and safety consciousness (SC) as potential predictors of safety performance. Path analysis on data from a survey among 78 warehouse managers and 1033 warehouse employees shows, in line with prior research, that HRS is a strong predictor of safety performance. Importantly, our results also suggest that SSTL may be an even more important predictor of safety performance than HRS. SSTL affects safety performance directly (contrary to our expectations SC does not mediate this relationship) and strongly predicts safety performance even after controlling for the effects of HRS. SSTL also mediates some of the effects of HRS on safety performance. Subsequently, we propose that leaders are critical in fostering safety on the work floor. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Product recalls due to safety hazards entail societal costs, such as property damage, injury, and sometimes death. For firms, the related external failure costs are many, including the costs of recalling the product, providing a remedy, meeting the legal liability, and repairing damage to the firm's reputation. The recent spate of product recalls has shifted attention from why products are recalled to why it takes so long to recall a defective product that poses a safety hazard. To address this, our research subjects to empirical scrutiny the time to recall and its relationship with recall strategies, source of the defect and supply chain position of the recalling firm. We develop and verify our conceptual arguments in the U.S. toy industry by analyzing over 500 product recalls during a 15-year period (1993-2008). The empirical results indicate that the time to recall, as measured by difference between product recall announcement date and product first sold date, is associated with (1) the recall strategy (preventive vs. reactive) adopted by the firm, (2) the type of product defect (manufacturing defect vs. design flaw), and (3) the supply chain entity that issues the recall (toy company vs. distributor vs. retailer). Our results provide cues that could trigger a firm's recognition of factors that increase the time to recall. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Anecdotal evidence from the Japanese and U.S. automotive industry and emerging research suggests that inter-organizational identification of suppliers with their buyers, termed supplier-to-buyer identification, is an unexplored factor of relational advantage. This study presents a model and empirical test that supplier-to-buyer identification fosters superior operational performance by enhancing trust, supplier relation-specific investments, and information exchange. Through a survey of 346 automotive supplier-buyer relationships, the findings show that supplier-to-buyer identification directly impacts supplier relationship-specific investments and information exchange, although most of the latter effect is mediated by trust. The findings also indicate that supplier relation-specific investments and information exchange play different but complementary roles in influencing operational performance. The results suggest new directions for supplier-buyer relationship research in operations management and important managerial implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the social capital argument, SCM scholars have investigated how a buyer can gain access to and leverage resources through its collaborative BSRs. Our study extends this research stream by considering the "dark side" of social capital in BSRs. It evaluates how social capital in its cognitive, relational, and structural forms contributes to or impedes value creation within BSRs. Both primary survey measures and secondary objective measures have been used in data analysis. The results show the presence of both the bright side, confirming the existing literature, and the dark side, extending the literature. There is an inverted curvilinear relationship between social capital and performance: Either too little or too much social capital can hurt performance. This study confirms that building social capital in a collaborative BSR positively affects buyer performance, but that if taken to an extreme it can reduce the buyer's ability to be objective and make effective decisions as well as increase the supplier's opportunistic behavior. Our study also examines how a buyer can delay the emergence of the dark side. It opens up new research avenues in the collaborative BSR context and suggests directions for future research and practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Scholars and proactive companies have begun to create more sustainable supply chains. What has not been fully addressed is how organizations deal with short-term pressures to remain economically viable while implementing these newly modeled supply chains. In this study, we use theory-building through case studies to answer the question: how do organizations balance short-term profitability and long-term environmental sustainability when making supply chain decisions under conditions of uncertainty? We present five sets of propositions that explain how exemplars in green supply chain management make decisions and balance short and long term objectives. We also identify four environmental postures that help explain the decisions organizations make when dealing with strategic trade-offs among the economic, environmental and social elements of the triple-bottom-line.

This research examines two capabilities that enable firms to collaborate successfully as a means to combine knowledge and expertise in an episodic collaboration initiative. Building from two theoretical foundations, the knowledge-based and relational views of the firm, we examine the effects of absorptive capacity and collaborative process competence on the outcomes of an episodic collaboration initiative. Using structural equation modeling, we empirically validate the positive effect of absorptive capacity, collaborative process competence and level of engagement on the operational and relational success of a collaboration effort. Results show that collaborative process competence mediates the relationship between absorptive capacity and collaborative engagement, and positively influences both operational and relational outcomes. Finally, we offer suggestions for managers to improve the effectiveness of inter-firm collaboration initiatives and discuss future research opportunities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the contingency and organizational information processing theories, we argue that under a high EU the associations between supplier/customer integration, and delivery and flexibility performance, and those between internal integration, and product quality and production cost, will be strengthened. These theoretical propositions are largely confirmed by multi-group and structural path analyses of survey responses collected from 151 of Thailand's automotive manufacturing plants.

Focus in hospitals can take several different forms, ranging from standalone specialty centers to a hospital that chooses to emphasize in some operational way a particular specialty while still offering a full range of services. Although standalone facilities can be found in many locations, the vast majority of hospitals must follow the latter route to achieve focus. Current conceptualizations and measures of focus struggle to capture this construct in a way that does not assume a narrowing of range of offerings. In contrast to the traditional view of focus as narrowing, in this paper, we address the perspective of focus as emphasis. We select cardiology as the specialty and use secondary data for more than 264,000 patients in New York State to examine the relationship between focus as emphasis and hospital cost performance. Our results support the notion that such focus is associated with lower costs. Moreover, our results also show that focus in hospitals can be operationalized as a disproportionate emphasis on one line of service, without necessarily narrowing the overall range of services provided.

In this paper, a methodological review of OSCM empirical research in 2002-2007 is provided to highlight that OSCM empirical studies, unlike those in other business disciplines, have rarely used content analysis as a methodological tool. This paper then reviews the methodological strengths of content analysis, which lie primarily in its malleability, economy of data collection, repeatability, and unobtrusiveness. These strengths not only make content analysis a viable empirical method but also position it as a method that can be used in concert with other empirical methods in OSCM research, such as survey, case study, and secondary research methodologies. This paper also proposes a generic framework for a content analytic approach to measuring theoretical constructs, illustrates the application of the framework to a construct in the OSCM literature (buyer-supplier relationalism), and reports the satisfactory results of reliability and validity tests for the content analysis-based measure of buyer-supplier relationalism. In addition. this paper proposes and demonstrates that the use of convergence study in tandem with content analysis can substantially reduce the content analysis efforts needed in measuring the construct of interest, thus improving the overall efficiency of the process of content analysis.

We first discuss specific aspects of knowledge work task uncertainty, process invisibility, and architectural ambiguity that call into question the relevance of lean production in this setting. Then, combining a detailed case study and empirical analysis, we find that lean software projects perform better than non-lean software projects at the company for most performance outcomes. We document the influence of the lean initiative on internal processes and examine how the techniques affect learning by improving both problem identification and problem resolution. Finally, we extend the lean production framework by highlighting the need to (1) identify problems early in the process and (2) keep problems and solutions together in time, space, and person.

We focus specifically on returns management at the marketing-operations interface, by utilizing the conceptualization of customer value and its related drivers. In order to explore the phenomenon of returns management across a multi-disciplinary, managerial spectrum, a qualitative research methodology relying on individual managers' perceptions was chosen to generate depth of understanding given the limited current understanding of the research topic under consideration. Our results suggest that functional integration at the marketing-operations interface can lead to better alignment of corporate resources and thus create higher levels of customer value. We also found the external business environment to impact how and why a firm creates customer value through the returns management process. Overall, our results suggest that when returns management is recognized as a matter of a firm's competitiveness, the joint role of operations and marketing is imperative to success.

Academic knowledge about fleet management in humanitarian operations is scarce. Using a multiple case research design we study Field Vehicle Fleet Management (Field VFM) in four large International Humanitarian Organizations (IHO): the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the World Food Program and World Vision International. Our field research includes more than 40 interviews at headquarters, regional and national level in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The paper answers three research questions: (1) How do IHO manage their field vehicle fleets? (2) What are the critical factors affecting IHO Field VFM? (3) How does Field VFM affect in-country program delivery? The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it helps to fill the existing gap in the humanitarian literature regarding Field VFM. Second, it expands the fleet management literature to a new and virtually unexplored area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of 1726 intake appointments for the year preceding and the full year following the lean project showed a 27% increase in service capacity to intake new patients and a 12% reduction in the no-show rate as a result of the transformation of service processes achieved by the lean project. This study's action research methodology leverages the researcher's involvement in redesigning a service system that greatly improved performance and led to reflection on traditional operations management (OM) approaches to appointment scheduling. The study generates insights about effective alignment of resources, develops new strategies for service operations to respond to no-shows, reveals time-related variables that have been overlooked in appointment scheduling research, and challenges traditional OM scheduling performance measures. We provide recommendations for effective and appropriate use of overbooking and identify avenues for future research to continuously improve and increase the capacity of service operations.

However, functional areas such as sales, marketing, finance, and operations traditionally specialize in portions of the planning activities, which results in conflicts over expectations, preferences, and priorities. We report findings from a detailed case analysis of a supply chain planning process that seemingly weathers these cross-functional conflicts. In contrast to traditional research on this area, which focuses on incentives, responsibilities, and structures, we adopt a process perspective and find that integration was achieved despite formal functional incentives that did not support it. By drawing a distinction between the incentive landscape and the planning process, we identify process as a mediator that can affect organizational outcomes. Thus, organizations may be capable of integration while functions retain different incentives and orientations to maintain focus on their stakeholders' needs. Through iterative coding, we identify the attributes of the planning process that can drive planning performance information, procedural, and alignment quality but also find evidence that achieving alignment in the execution of plans can be more important than informational and procedural quality. In addition to process attributes, we also identify social elements that influenced the performance of the planning process and place the information processing attributes within a broader social and organizational context.

We analyze an experience-based service where external design firms typically perform service design and implementation tasks, while local service personnel manage daily operations. We examine whether the quality of service during routine operation periods exhibits learning effect patterns. We also examine window of opportunity effects after major redesigns. Examining Yearly data on top Texas golf courses, we observe learning across the lifespan of golf courses and relearning after golf course redesigns. The findings contribute to the literature on learning and experience-based services. The study provides managerial insight by demonstrating the extent of learning, illustrating how redesigns can affect service outcomes negatively, showing how relearning occurs, and discussing tactics for success when redesigning services.

Given that the priority of R&D projects and the interdependencies between the projects in a high tech firm change dynamically, high tech R&D project management is a complex and challenging endeavor. To improve the understanding and management of high tech R&D projects, this paper reports the findings of a field study where we, first, develop and empirically estimate a model that relates project priority over time with the generative mechanisms of market pull and technical challenge associated with R&D projects. Next, we develop and demonstrate the application of a process model within which the time-varying project priority model is embedded. The process model makes it possible to allocate fixed resources among competing projects with time-varying interdependencies, thereby improving the timeliness of project completion. This research was conducted in collaboration with a major U.S. high tech firm. The corporate R&D center of the firm served as the research setting for the field study. We present an application of the process model to delineate the evolution of the R&D organization with the merger of its (technology driven) parent firm with another (market driven) high tech manufacturing firm. The application of the process model generates theoretical insights that are used to develop testable propositions. Implications of the study findings and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We conceptualize customization relevant to the two constituent sub-processes in the online purchase process: (i) decision customization the customization of the information content delivered to customers to help them in the decision-making sub-process; and (ii) transaction customization the customization of the purchase transaction sub-process for each customer. We draw on and synthesize the theoretical perspectives of Website Usability, Technology Acceptance Model, and Transaction Costs, to triangulate and deduce hypotheses linking customization of the online purchase process in electronic retailing and customer satisfaction. The hypotheses are tested by analyzing: (i) primary data on customization of the online purchase process collected from an online field study involving a direct observation and content analysis of the websites of 422 retailers; and (ii) secondary data on customer satisfaction with the online purchase process for the same set of 422 electronic retailers collected from a publicly available data source. The research method used for the empirical analysis is Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). The results indicate that decision customization that provides choice assistance by way of personalized product recommendations is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the decision-making sub-process; and transaction customization, oriented towards making the transaction sub-process personal, convenient, and interactive is positively associated with customer satisfaction with the purchase transaction sub-process. Additionally, the results indicate that both decision customization and transaction customization are associated with overall customer satisfaction with the online purchase process of electronic retailers. The contributions, managerial implications, and limitations of the study, and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The remote warehouses serve customers in their respective regions. Common assumptions in the academic literature include use of the Poisson demand process and instantaneous unit-by-unit replenishment. In the practitioner literature, single-echelon approximations are advised for setting safety stock to deal with lead time, demand, and supply variations in these settings. Using data from a U.S. supplier of home improvement products, we find that neither the assumptions from the academic literature nor the approximations from the practitioner literature necessarily work well in practice. In a variation of the strictly arborescent supply chain, the central warehouse at our real company not only replenishes other warehouses but also meets demand from customers in the region near the central warehouse. In this paper, we study this dual-role central warehouse structure, which we believe is common in practice. Using high and low volume product demand data from this company, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the impact of (1) the use of a dual-role centralized warehouse, (2) common demand assumptions made in multi-echelon research, and (3) single-echelon approximations for managing a multi-echelon supply chain. We explore each of these under both centralized and decentralized control logic. We find that the common assumptions of theoretical models impede their usefulness and that heuristics that ignore the actual supply chain structure fail to account for additional opportunities to utilize safety stock more effectively. Researchers should be aware of the gap between standard assumptions in traditional literature and actual practice, and critically evaluate their assumptions to find a reasonable balance between tractability and relevance.

In addition, this research investigates the implied conflict between striving for short-term results and achieving long-term development of capabilities. It also examines the tension between the lack of resources of the typical small and medium sized enterprise (SME) users of BP's and the time required to develop a critical mass of capability. A longitudinal case-based study of eight SME contexts examined BPI outcomes and factors leading to short- and long-term success and sustaining best practices. The research identifies factors related to the intervention context, implementation and change-agent approach. The data indicate that in resource-limited SMEs BPIs are limited in their ability to develop adequate capability for long-term change. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Has this course of action been at the expense of developing similar internal information-based linkages? This research explores the specific roles of internal and external information-based linkages in achieving improved operational performance. Based on a single case study that comprises a supply chain containing twenty-four internal and fourteen external linkages this research develops a series of propositions. We find that the individual internal linkages may be useful for extending externally derived visibility, and for addressing to some extent, "structural holes" in the supply chain. Additionally, to extend visibility across the entire supply chain, organizations need to recognize the combining role of internal and external information-based linkages. Finally we offer some thoughts for future research in this area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, prior research has only examined the influence of social capital elements on performance, either individually or in part. We propose an integrative model examining the relationships among relational, structural and cognitive dimensions of social capital, and between these dimensions and the cost and innovation performance of the firm. A sample of 163 buyer-supplier relationships is used to test the model. Regression results indicate that the relational dimension of social capital fully or partially mediates the effect of the cognitive dimension on performance, and partially mediates the link between the structural dimension, operationalized as social interaction ties, and innovation performance. Further, high levels of legal bonds were found to moderate the relationship between the relational dimension of social capital and performance outcomes. Implications for theory and managers are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This development is often associated with a firm's tendency to change from a make to a buy strategy. However, a few studies investigate the change of product architecture in the reverse direction - from modular to integral form - and the subsequent change in the firm sourcing decision from a buy to a make strategy. These studies hold to the presumption that a firm following a make strategy will outperform firms following a buy strategy in dealing with integral product architectures. Based on the knowledge-based view, we argue for the viability of a sourcing strategy between the pure make and buy strategies - a pseudo-make strategy. We also argue that as product architecture changes from a modular to integral form, firms adopting this pseudo-make strategy are likely to show better product performance than firms following a pure make or buy strategy due to the relative knowledge advantages of the pseudo-make strategy in dealing with the integral product architecture. We examine the impact of the make/pseudo-make/buy strategies on product performance in the U.S. bicycle derailleur and freewheel market from 1980 to 1992 and provide theoretical and managerial implications of our results. Our findings highlight an important distinction between the pseudo-make and make-buy strategies that has not previously been fully appreciated in the extant literature, and as a result increases our understanding of why some firms do not switch strategies from a buy to a make strategy when product architecture changes from modular to integral form as previously expected.

WOS:000288926200003	E-commerce; Marketing-operations interface; Empirical study	PRODUCT RETURNS; SERVICE QUALITY; INVENTORY MODEL; SEARCH; COSTS; ORGANIZATIONS; INFORMATION; FULFILLMENT; COMMERCE; BENEFITS	4	Internet retailing offers merchants limitless shelf space. This has led experts to highlight the existence of a "long tail" of offerings on the web and assert that the future of online business is "selling less of more." However, it is difficult for Internet retailers of physical goods to sell a large scope of products without having to handle potentially large amounts of product returns from customers. This is due to the fact that customers can and do get overwhelmed by excessive product variety and often make erroneous purchasing decisions. We shed light on this issue through an assessment of theoretical predictions based on data from sales and returns of almost 7000 products in a particular product category. While retailers can benefit from expanding the scope of their inventories to generate Internet sales, the success of this strategy will depend on the control of unjustified product returns by consumers and the management of recurrent execution errors and product fit failures in transactions with customers. Furthermore, from our results, the gains that this strategy will bring to retailers will be bound by the amount of time products have been available on the Internet retailer's site, as well as by other attributes such as product price and size.

Building upon boundary theory and supply chain cooperation research, we identify three boundary spanning capabilities of purchasing agents and empirically test how these capabilities shape buyer-supplier trust development. Using two samples of data collected from suppliers in the automotive industry and food industry, we found that a purchasing agent's effectiveness in strategic communication with suppliers affects a supplier's trust in the buying firm, while an agent's professional knowledge and ability to reach compromises with suppliers affect a supplier's trust in the purchasing agent representing the firm. Trust in the purchasing agent in turn affects trust in the buying firm. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Five main operations management journals are included for their impact on the field. They are in alphabetical order: Decision Sciences. International journal of Operations and Production Management Journal of Operations Management. Management Science, and Production and Operations Management. The qualitative case studies chosen were published between 1992 and 2007. With an increasing trend toward using more qualitative case studies, there have been meaningful and significant contributions to the field of operations management, especially in the area of theory building. However, in many of the qualitative case studies we reviewed, sufficient details in research design, data collection, and data analysis were missing. For instance, there are studies that do not offer sampling logic or a description of the analysis through which research outcomes are drawn. Further, research protocols for doing inductive case studies are much better developed compared to the research protocols for doing deductive case studies. Consequently, there is a lack of consistency in the way the case method has been applied. As qualitative researchers, we offer suggestions on how we can improve on what we have done and elevate the level of rigor and consistency. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The model includes the primary components of JIT (JIT-purchasing and JIT-production) as antecedents and operational performance and firm performance as consequences to agile manufacturing. Using data collected from production and operations managers working for large U.S. manufacturers, the model is assessed following a structural equation modeling methodology. The results indicate that JIT-purchasing has a direct positive relationship with agile manufacturing while the positive relationship between JIT-production and agile manufacturing is mediated by JIT-purchasing. The results also indicate that agile manufacturing has a direct positive relationship with the operational performance of the firm, that the operational performance of the firm has a direct positive relationship with the marketing performance of the firm, and that the positive relationship between the operational performance of the firm and the financial performance of the firm is mediated by the marketing performance of the firm.

The inventory-performance link revisited	WOS:000288926200007	Inventory management; Financial/economic analysis; Lean manufacturing; Empirical research methods	INDUSTRY; MANAGEMENT	4	While firms increasingly adopt lean inventory practices, there is limited evidence that inventory leanness leads to improved firm performance. This study reexamines this relationship in an attempt to overcome some shortcomings of previous research. To that end, a theory-based measure of inventory leanness, which takes into account industry-specific inventory management characteristics, is proposed. The analysis of a large panel data set of U.S. manufacturing companies reveals that the significance and shape of the inventory-performance relationship varies substantially across industries. This relationship is significant in two-thirds of the 54 industries studied. In most of these instances, the relationship is concave, suggesting that there is an optimum level of inventory leanness beyond which firm performance deteriorates. A post-hoc analysis is conducted to identify industry-level characteristics that may determine the nature the inventory-performance relationship. Managerial implications are discussed and several opportunities for future research are outlined. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of the study is to uncover the nature of supply chain collaboration and explore its impact on firm performance based on a paradigm of collaborative advantage. Reliable and valid instruments of these constructs were developed through rigorous empirical analysis. Data were collected through a Web survey of U.S. manufacturing firms in various industries. The statistical methods used include confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (i.e., LISREL). The results indicate that supply chain collaboration improves collaborative advantage and indeed has a bottom-line influence on firm performance, and collaborative advantage is an intermediate variable, that enables supply chain partners to achieve synergies and create superior performance.

We extend planning and scheduling theory with a categorization of scheduling performance criteria, based on a three-stage survey research design. Particularly, the results show that, next to schedule quality, the planning process factors timeliness, flexibility, communication, and negotiation are important performance criteria, and especially so in organizations that are faced with high levels of uncertainty. The results suggest that organizational and behavioral aspects of planning and scheduling cannot be mitigated with advanced models and software that solely focus on good schedules. Rather, high quality schedules and high quality scheduling processes need to be facilitated simultaneously to attain high planning and scheduling performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we demonstrate how to use social network analysis. to investigate the structural characteristics of supply networks. Our theoretical framework relates key social network analysis metrics to supply network constructs. We apply this framework to the three automotive supply networks reported in Choi and Hong (2002). Each of the supply networks is analyzed in terms of both materials flow and contractual relationships. We compare the social network analysis results with the case-based interpretations in Choi and Hong (2002) and conclude that our framework can both supplement and complement case-based analysis of supply networks.

How can companies improve the social and environmental performance within their supply chains, particularly as other competitive pressures, such as cost and quality, continue to escalate? Starting from an efficient versus responsive supply chain framework, we develop an integrative model that blends together elements of supply chain configuration, stakeholder management, and capability development. Specifically, we spotlight the dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and performance. In particular, this analysis reveals that the nature of stakeholder exposure determines how social/environmental technical and relational capabilities impact social and environmental outcomes. We conclude with implications for research and practice, discussing how current supply chain theories must be extended to incorporate external stakeholders, to clarify strategies and identify potential pitfalls, and to better predict performance outcomes.

Studies examining the link between performance management and performance improvement implicitly assume that performance management affects behavior of individuals in an organization, which then facilitates the achievement of organizational goals. This study takes a step towards understanding this implicit assumption. We investigate how performance management practices relate to improvement in performance by influencing behavior of individuals. We focus on operational performance management, i.e. the definition and use of performance measures on the shopfloor in production and distribution. We use a survey among 102 companies to identify the relations between performance management practices, shopfloor behavior and improvement in performance. We identified three independent clusters of operator behavior that positively correlate with performance improvement: "Understanding", "Motivation" and "Focus on Improvement". We show that 17 out of the 20 performance management practices found in literature have a significant and positive relation with one or more clusters of operator behavior. We furthermore found that there is a positive correlation between the number of performance management practices applied and performance improvement, suggesting that it is not only which practices are applied but also how many. Recommendations emerging from this study enable managers to identify which behavioral changes are desired to improve performance and to select those performance management practices that positively influence the desired behavior.

According to this explanation, raw materials inventories are larger the higher a company's transaction costs and the lower its storage-related production and management costs. Factors that affect these costs are the company's vulnerability to opportunism, whether the input becomes more or less costly to store and manage as it moves through the supply chain, payment terms and the company's power in relation to its supplier. This explanation for the level of raw materials inventories was tested on a large sample of customer industries matched to their main supplier industries. Consistent with this theory, the empirical results show that companies hold larger raw materials inventories the more money their suppliers spend on research and development and the less important the customers are to their suppliers. These results are important because they indicate companies must consider a wider range of factors than previously thought necessary when establishing inventory policy.

While one view relates efficiency with good operations management and asserts that slack resources are a form of waste that should be minimized, the other view suggests that limited resource slack can impose heavy costs on firms by making them brittle. In this research, the authors build on these views to investigate the relationship of inventory, production, and marketing resource efficiency of firms with three metrics of financial performance (i.e., Stock-Returns, Tobin's Q, and Returns-on-Assets). The authors evaluate the theoretical framework using secondary information on all U.S. based publicly-owned manufacturing firms across the 16-year time period of 1991-2006. Analysis utilizing a mixed-model approach reveals that a focus on resource efficiency is positively associated with firm financial performance. However, findings also support the arguments favoring slack, indicating that the financial gains from resource efficiency exhibit diminishing returns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, drawing on information processing theory, we examine the role of integration in BPO and its effect on BPO firm performance. BPO Integration is concerned with the overall coordination of business processes and activities across different units within the outsourced environment. It involves both internal process integration - effective integration of task execution within the BPO and external process integration - effective integration between the BPO and their clients. Using survey data gathered from 205 Indian BPO service providers, we analyze the antecedents of process integration and its impact on BPO performance. The antecedents we examine are task complexity, task security, end customer orientation of the client and IT capability of the BPO. Among other results, we find that both internal and external process integration partially mediate the impact of the antecedents on performance. We draw managerial implications of our research to practicing BPO and client managers on how BPO outsourcing can be made successful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although a myriad of new B2B e-marketplaces were launched over the past decade, a substantial number failed shortly after the peak of the NASDAQ in 2000. The bursting of the Internet bubble provides a setting for assessing salient, theory-based determinants of failure and success. Accordingly, we apply a service operations strategy lens and complementary organizational theories to explain how three strategic factors industrial sector characteristics, ownership structure, and functionality of service offering may have influenced B2B e-marketplaces' odds of survival after the bubble. We empirically test these factors using logistic regression analysis on a sample of 854 B2B e-marketplaces. Consistent with emerging e-services literature, our empirical results indicate that B2B e-marketplaces serving industrial sectors that are a better fit with the Internet service delivery systems by high information dependence and low information tacitness have the highest likelihood of success, as do e-marketplaces with service offerings that facilitate collaboration among multiple buyers and sellers. We also demonstrate the positive influence of consortium ownership structure on B2B e-marketplace survival, albeit not for first-mover consortia-backed e-marketplaces. Our findings contribute to the service operations strategy literature and provide direction for managers in the areas of e-service strategy and investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This article employs the contingency theory of organizations to explain the gap between the practice and the academic models of production planning. Arguments on the contingency effects of process complexity lead to a hypothesis that expects simple capacity planning methods to be most effective in certain production processes. A strong inference research setting is used to test the contingency hypothesis against a conventional hypothesis that expects the most sophisticated planning techniques to always be most effective. Multisource data from the machinery manufacturing industry support the contingency hypothesis and reject the universalistic hypothesis. The findings are explained using the concepts of task interdependence and bounded rationality. The results have several managerial implications, and they elaborate how classic concepts in organization theory can bring practically relevant insights to operations management research.

It is thus important for the new venture to attract funding from external investors such as suppliers. Although the operations management (OM) literature addresses product development and supplier involvement in large firms, few studies have examined the relationship between suppliers and new ventures. This study examines how new ventures can complement their resources and experience with supplier investment, to build positional advantages for their first product and increase marketplace performance. We integrate the OM and entrepreneurship literatures to develop a model based on the resource-based view of the firm, in which the new venture uses external and internal resources to achieve positional advantages of product innovativeness, supplier involvement in production, and product launch quality. We also investigate how market potential moderates the relationship between positional advantages and performance. We empirically test our model using data from 711 new ventures. We find that it is beneficial for a new venture to involve suppliers in production of the first product, and that market potential positively moderates the relationship of product launch quality and performance. However, the results reported here also reveal several surprising results challenging traditional views. Developing a highly innovative first product is much less, not more, important than achieving a high quality first-product launch. Increasing product innovativeness does not necessarily lead to high product performance for new ventures. For a small market with low growth potential, product innovativeness has a negative, not positive, effect on first product performance. We discuss managerial implications of our findings.

However, the association between manufacturing capabilities and firm performance has seldom been studied in the context of high technology new ventures. Using a sample of 167 UK-based, high technology manufacturing ventures, the current study examines the relationship between manufacturing capabilities (in particular, those contributing to low operating costs and product quality) and venture performance. Additionally, the moderating effects of the ventures' alliance portfolios and environmental contexts on the capability-performance relationships are explored. Results indicate that venture performance (as reflected in sales growth, return on sales (ROS), and return on assets (ROA)) is significantly predicted by manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs and product quality. Further, the data generally support the hypothesized moderating effects of two alliance diversity variables (alliance partner diversity and alliance geographic diversity) and two environmental context variables (environmental dynamism and environmental munificence) on the capability-performance relationships. Overall, the study supports the premise that the value of manufacturing capabilities (i.e., the strength of the capability-performance relationship) among high technology ventures is contingent upon the alliance and environmental contexts within which those ventures operate. Specifically, alliance partner diversity, alliance geographic diversity, and environmental munificence enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote low operating costs. Alliance partner diversity, environmental munificence, and environmental stability enhance the value of manufacturing capabilities that promote product quality. The study's theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Likewise, growing evidence suggests that effective operations control is a common quality of successful firms. On the surface the two phenomena corporate entrepreneurship and operations control may seem to be inherently at odds. That is, corporate entrepreneurship is aimed at taking the firm in new directions, while operations control is aimed at channeling and often restricting actions. As such, it would be useful to know how operations control variables act in concert with the determinants of corporate entrepreneurial activity to promote the innovation outcomes that facilitate long-term organizational success. In this study of 177 firms operating in a wide variety of industries, we investigate the effect on innovation performance of several commonly-acknowledged antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship, as measured by the Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2008, 2002); namely, management support, work discretion/autonomy, rewards/reinforcements, time availability, and organizational boundaries. More importantly, we examine the moderating effects of operations control variables specifically risk control and process control formality - on the relationships between the antecedents of corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance. Results indicate that only two of the five antecedents to corporate entrepreneurship have main effects on innovation performance with moderate significance. However, each of the five antecedents significantly interacts with one or both of the operations control variables and, thereby, influences innovation performance. The implications of these results in relation to operations management and corporate entrepreneurship theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, uncertain and dynamic task environments of emerging firms require more flexible organizational structures. Such duality of structural prescriptions stems from competing demands of task and institutional environments. We propose that manufacturing flexibility could help decouple activities required in task environments from those required in institutional environments, thereby mitigating the conflict of adopting flexible and rigid structures at the same time. An emerging venture could meet demands of institutional environments through formalized structures, and use manufacturing flexibility to address needs of task environment in order to mitigate liabilities of newness. Using a sample of 167 high-technology manufacturing firms in the UK, we use a moderated polynomial regression approach to test the proposed framework. Results indicate that formalized structures in conjunction with manufacturing flexibility lead to enhanced performance. The findings extend literature on organizational structures in operations management and entrepreneurship. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SCI consists of internal integration of different functions within a company and external integration with trading partners. While both supply chain internal and external integration have been studied extensively, our understanding of what influences SCI and the relationship between internal and external integration is still very limited. This paper argues that external integration with customers and suppliers is simultaneously influenced by internal integration and relationship commitment to customers and suppliers. Internal integration enables external integration because organizations must first develop internal integration capabilities through system-, data-, and process-integration, before they can engage in meaningful external integration. At the same time, before external integration can be successfully implemented, organizations must have a willingness to integrate with external supply chain partners, which is demonstrated by their relationship commitment. We propose and test a model that specifies the relationship between internal integration, relationship commitment, and external integration, using data collected from manufacturing firms in China. The results show that internal integration and relationship commitment improve external integration independently, and their interactive effect on external integration is not significant. However, internal integration has a much greater impact on external integration than relationship commitment. We also examine the model for companies with different ownerships, and the results indicate that for Chinese controlled companies where there is a strong collectivism culture and more reliance on "Guanxi" (relationship), relationship commitment has a significant impact on external integration with suppliers and customers. This is in stark contrast to foreign controlled companies, characterized by a more individualistic culture and more reliance on technological capabilities, where no significant relationship between relationship commitment and external integration could be found. The model is also tested across different industries and different regions in China, providing useful insights for Chinese companies in particular. This study makes significant contributions to the SCI literature by simultaneously studying the effects of internal integration and relationship commitment on external integration, and providing several future research directions.

Despite its growing popularity, few studies have offered a coherent theoretical basis for the standard's appeal. A theory-based explanation enhances understanding and appreciation for the standard, and provides clarity on how the standard benefits organizations. In this paper, we invoke the resource dependence theory (RDT) to purport that the standard is used by organizations as a tool to manage their organizational environment. It does this by specifying procedures that organizations need to manage their organization-environment boundary spanning processes. Using the RDT perspective, a model with three key constructs embodying ISO 9000 was developed: internal processes, relationships with customers and relationships with suppliers. The latter two were treated as being part of the task environment. We predicted that the external aspects of the standard affect operating performance (a measure of effectiveness), both directly and through internal processes. Empirical data from 416 ISO 9000 registered Australian manufacturing plants validated the RDT perspective, and suggest that the three constructs, individually and in isolation, are not as effective as when they are considered together. By invoking RDT, a new theoretical viewpoint to ISO 9000 has been developed that adds to other theoretical perspectives, and goes some way to explaining the growing popularity of this standard with organizations.

This conceptual model is tested with 225 dyad samples from manufacturer-distributor supply chains in China. The results show that cooperation and the type of conflict have both individual and interactive effects on the manufacturer's knowledge acquisition, thus highlighting the importance of the co-opetition perspective on supply chain knowledge management. More importantly, the results show that the entrepreneurial orientation of a distributor positively moderates the relationships between co-opetition factors and a manufacturer's knowledge acquisition, implying that strengthening the distributor's entrepreneurial orientation can improve the efficiency of co-opetition and thereby affect the knowledge acquisition of the manufacturer, and highlighting the importance of blended analysis across the domains of supply chain management and entrepreneurship.

Our paper studies the role of individual experience, organizational experience, team leader experience, and experience working together on a team (team familiarity) in the context of improvement teams. To do so, we analyze successful and failed six sigma improvement team projects at a Fortune 500 consumer products manufacturer with multiple business groups. Such improvement project teams focus on deliberate learning, which differs from the primary focus of work teams. Our analysis uses archival data generated by these improvement project teams over a six year time span. Of the four experience variables we study, we find that team leader experience exhibits the strongest relationship with project success, followed by organizational experience. Further, in contrast to prior-related research on work teams, we find no relationship between individual experience or team familiarity and project success beyond that explained by team leader and organizational experience. These results suggest that a well-developed and deployed structured problem-solving process-characteristic of effective six sigma deployments-may reduce the importance of team familiarity in the context of improvement teams.

To understand the functioning of the entire system requires proper consideration of all its components. We identify seven key components: the objectives being pursued, the origin of the commodity flows to be transported, knowledge of demand, the decision-making structure, periodicity and volume of logistic activities, and the state of the social networks and supporting systems. Based on our analysis of the differences between commercial and humanitarian logistics, we pinpoint research gaps that need to be filled to enhance both the efficiency of humanitarian logistics and the realism of the mathematical models designed to support it. We argue that humanitarian logistics is too broad a field to fit neatly into a single definition of operational conditions. At one end of the spectrum we find humanitarian logistic efforts of the kind conducted in long-term disaster recovery and humanitarian assistance, where operational efficiency - akin to commercial logistics - is a prime consideration. At the other, post-disaster humanitarian logistic operations involved in disaster response and short-term recovery activities represent a vastly different operational environment, often in chaotic settings where urgent needs, life-or-death decisions and scarce resources are the norm. The huge contrast between these operational environments requires that they be treated separately. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anecdotal evidence points to numerous situations where companies have failed to harness the potential of e-procurement. In this paper, we argue that online purchase volume and mix flexibilities facilitated by these applications play a significant role in the ability of firms to benefit from e-procurement. We examine this tenet from both an economic as well as a social perspective. We propose that increased online purchase volume flexibility as well as online purchase mix flexibility can be facilitated by two mechanisms - supplier customization as explained by transaction costs perspective, and information sharing between supply chain partners using a social exchange theoretical perspective. The increased purchase volume and mix flexibility in turn leads to better performance along the dimensions of cost, quality, and delivery. We present and test a nuanced perspective where we argue that (i) the effect of supplier customization on both purchase volume and mix flexibilities will be moderated by the frequency of transactions conducted online, and (ii) the effect of information sharing on both purchase volume and mix flexibilities will be moderated by trust in the supplier. We estimate our research model using survey data collected from 130 purchasing and procurement managers. We find strong support for our proposed research model with results indicating that purchase volume and mix flexibilities play a vital mediating role in impacting e-procurement performance. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To carry out this investigation, the event study methodology is employed. The ten year period consists of three years prior to Six Sigma implementation, the event year corresponding to the year Six Sigma is adopted, and six years post Six Sigma implementation. To assess the impact of adopting Six Sigma on corporate performance we utilize commonly used measures including Operating Income/Total Assets (OI/A), Operating Income/Sales (OI/S), Operating Income/Number of Employees (OI/E), Sales/Assets (S/A), and Sales/Number of Employees (S/E). The sample Six Sigma firms are compared to different benchmarks including the overall industry performance and to the performance of carefully selected portfolios of control firms. The results of the study indicate that adopting Six Sigma positively impacts organizational performance primarily through the efficiency with which employees are deployed. More specifically, enhanced employee productivity results were observed in both static analyses that assessed the performance of the sample Six Sigma firms relative to their control groups at discrete points in time and dynamic analyses of the Six Sigma firms' rate of improvement relative to the rate of improvement of their control groups. Benefits in terms of improved asset efficiency were not observed. Finally, there was no evidence that Six Sigma negatively impacts corporate performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We employ various matching procedures using different combinations of pre-adoption return on assets (ROA), industry, and size as matching criteria. By comparing performance outcomes across a hierarchy of operating metrics, we establish a pattern of Six Sigma adoption effects that provides strong evidence of a positive impact on ROA. Interestingly, these ROA improvements arise mostly from significant reductions in indirect costs: significant improvements in direct costs and asset productivity are not evident. We also find small improvements in sales growth due to Six Sigma adoption. Cross-sectional analyses of the performance results reveal that distinctions in Six Sigma impacts across manufacturing and service firms are negligible. Interestingly, we find that the performance impact of Six Sigma adoption is negatively correlated to the firm's quality system maturity (indicated by prior ISO 9000 certification). Further analyses of manufacturing and service firms reveals that Six Sigma benefits are significantly correlated with intensity in manufacturing, and with financial performance before adoption in services. We discuss the implications of these findings for practice and for future research. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although these venerable methods should continue to be employed effectively in the OM literature, we also believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the scope of clustering methods to emergent techniques. We provide an overview of some alternative clustering procedures (including advantages and disadvantages), identify software programs for implementing them, and discuss the circumstances where they might be employed gainfully in OM research. The implementation of emergent clustering methods in the OM literature should enable researchers to offer implications for practice that might not have been uncovered with traditional methods.

The use of PLS in the field of operations management is also growing. However, questions still exist among some operations management researchers regarding whether and how PLS should be used. To address these questions, our study provides a practical guideline for using PLS and uses examples from the operations management literature to demonstrate how the specific points in this guideline can be applied. In addition, our study reviews and summarizes the use of PLS in the recent operations management literature according to our guideline.

Underpinned by loose coupling theory, we build a mediating framework in which we propose that a high level of justice (or fairness) as mutually perceived by both parties drives buyer-supplier relationship performance through bolstered coupling links in mutual knowledge sharing, continuous commitment, and relationship investment. Our survey of 216 paired manufacturers (suppliers) and distributors (buyers) in China generally supports this argument, leading to a conclusion that justice is not a direct determinant of buyer-supplier performance but a critical conduit that nourishes mid-range coupling behaviors, which in turn promotes a successful relationship. Based on findings from this study, firms are encouraged to endorse all four kinds of justice in managing supply chain relationships. However, when constrained by resources, the recommendation for managers is to focus on achieving a high level of perceptual convergence on procedural justice and informational justice with the exchange partner, because mutual perceptions of procedural and informational justice have the strongest effects on coupling behaviors and buyer-supplier relationship performance.

Consumers value the flexibility to learn about the available offerings, complete their orders and obtain customer service across different channels in a convenient and integrated manner. Therefore, the retail industry has begun to use IT extensively to automate and integrate business processes across their traditional and online channels. This study examines the impacts of the use of IT by retail firms in integrating channel activities for selling to customers. Our research model argues that retail channel integration through IT should enhance the efficiency and innovation of a retail firm. In turn, these improvements should enhance their overall performance. We also propose that the environmental dynamism would moderate the effects of improvements in efficiency and innovation on firm performance. We draw upon recent theories in organizational resource integration and organizational learning to develop our research model and hypotheses. Based on survey data from 125 multichannel retailers in Singapore, we find that retail channel integration through the use of IT allows firms to not only be efficient in delivering the current offerings, but also be innovative in creating future offerings. Further, we find that environmental dynamism does positively moderate the effects of innovation ability on performance. Our results provide managerial insights for firms involved in digital integration not only in the retail sector but also in other service industries. These findings could also serve as a foundation for further research on service operations management for firms with both physical and online operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We define relational experience as either cooperative or competitive; distinguish between control and coordination functions of contractual governance; and assess their interplay on the negotiation strategy used in disputes. Using a unique data set of buyer-supplier disputes, we find, in particular that increasing contractual control governance weakens the positive effect of cooperative relational experience on cooperative negotiation strategy. However, increasing contractual control governance for a buyer-supplier dyad with competitive relational experience will increase cooperative negotiation strategy. Contractual coordination governance reinforces the positive effect of cooperative relational experience. Through this study, we reach a better understanding of how and when contractual and relational governance dimensions interact; rather than whether they act as substitutes or complements as has been studied in prior research. We discuss the implications of these findings for the field of supply chain management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This suggests that traditional supply chains have encountered limits to time-based competition in which the cost of faster replenishment exceeds the benefits. This paper explores and quantifies those limits to time-based competition in make-to-stock supply chains for functional products (products with stable demand over relatively long life cycles). The marginal value of time is used to define the limits of time-based competition in a supply chain, and we define it as the change in total inventory costs per unit change in supply chain lead-time. To calculate the value of time, we develop a set of simple analytical expressions that apply to most standard reorder-point inventory policies under deterministic and variable lead-times. By not requiring optimal inventory policies and expressing the value of time in terms of the unit cost of the product, we obtain very general results that are essentially product-free. We validate the analytical expressions using data from actual supply chains to simulate the inventory cost effects of changes in the lead-time. The results show that the marginal value of time in a supply chain is surprisingly low: it generally falls within a range of 0.4-0.8% of product unit cost per week. Our analytical models explain why there has been expansive growth in global supply chains for functional products. The key tradeoff in outsourcing is between reduced variable production cost and the increased inventory cost of longer supply chain lead-times. The models show analytically that the incremental inventory cost is extremely small relative to the cost benefit. The growth in global supply chains with long lead-times is cost, rather than time, driven. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of these two strategies, however, has not been uniform across firms, calling for a deeper examination of their relative effectiveness. Utilizing multiple theoretical frameworks, this study examines the relevance and effectiveness of the two collaborative strategies across the growth and maturity stages of the product life cycle (PLC). Specifically, the study analyzes the influence of competitive intensity as an antecedent to supplier development and relational initiatives, and the role of product life cycle as a moderator of the inter-relationships among competitive intensity, supplier development, relational initiatives, and supplier capability. Based on primary survey data, and discussion with practicing managers, the study finds that the individual and integrative effectiveness of supplier development investments (SDI) and relational orientation (RO) can be influenced differently by competitive intensity and PLC stage. In particular, RO can have a foundational role in motivating SDI for superior supplier capability, as also in safeguarding against supplier opportunism in the standardized product market context of the maturity stage. The managerial and theoretical implications of varied emphasis on the two collaborative supplier management strategies across the PLC stages are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The application of informal control to improve supplier performance has been well established, but the effect of formal control appears profoundly equivocal. This study proposes that the actual effect of formal control depends on its mode (output Vs. behavior) and its relationship with the service type (mass vs. professional) and informal control. With survey data from 252 service buying organizations, the results indicate that output control interacts with service type to determine perceived supplier performance (PSP). Buyers' reliance on high output control has a positive effect on PSP in mass service exchanges; this effect becomes negative in professional service exchanges. The effect of the interaction of behavior control and service type also depends on the presence of informal control. Buyers' reliance on high behavior control exerts a more positive effect on PSP in professional service exchanges than in mass service exchanges, but only in the presence of informal control. These findings have key implications for both theory and practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More recently, demand management has emerged as a new dimension at the customer interface. Although it has become increasing popular in industry, it has not yet been analyzed in depth with respect to its impact on supply chain performance. Both distribution management and demand management entail customer-facing processes and practices and that are interrelated and (may) jointly determine supply chain performance. In this paper we seek to extend the stream of research in supply chain management by systematically investigating the impact of customer-facing supply chain practices on supply chain performance. Specifically, the paper examines the relative impact of relevant practices associated with demand and distribution management. To this end, we collected data from 116 multi-national companies based in Europe and analyzed it using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results suggest that (i) high demand management performance has a substantial positive impact on the overall supply chain performance, (ii) this effect is stronger than that of distribution management performance, and (iii) there is no evidence that demand management might be an enabler for effective distribution management. Among the individual practices that constitute demand and distribution management, adherence to the demand and distribution management processes and demand segmentation emerged as the strongest performance levers. Based upon additional in-depth interviews conducted with selected companies from our sample, we shed light on some of the most important findings that emerged from our survey analysis.

In the online marketplace, one area of growing interest is that of product returns. Though commonly viewed as a cost center from an operations perspective, operations' actions have the potential to strongly influence future customer buying behavior in several ways. Using an archival database of actual purchase and returns history provided by a moderately sized online retailer, this study examines the relationship between a customer's experience of product returns, and subsequent shopping behavior. Employing transaction cost, consumer risk, and procedural justice theories, we demonstrate that the returns management process, rather than being regarded as an afterthought to the production and deployment of goods, can significantly and positively influence repurchase behavior. Additionally, we provide evidence that certain customers should be considered for prioritization in the returns process. We suggest ways through which operations managers can take care in discharging their responsibilities in this area - to make returns processing more than simply a "necessary cost of doing business" rather, using it to their advantage in engendering repeat and increased purchase behavior.

We test the proposed framework and hypotheses using empirical data from ISO 9001 certified manufacturing and service firms. The results show that a set of QM practices through process management has a positive relationship with all of these five types of innovation. It was found that process management directly and positively relates to incremental, radical, and administrative innovation. Organizational capability to manage processes may play a vital role in identifying routines, establishing a learning base, and supporting innovative activities. The findings also reveal that the value of an individual QM practice is tied to other QM practices. Therefore, highlighting just one or a few QM practices or techniques may not result in creative problem solving and innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results are estimated using weekly data over three years from 108 distribution centers of a major soft drink bottler. Our results show that fill rates are negatively associated with product variety at a diminishing rate. In addition, we examine the total effect of product variety on sales including both the direct effect and the indirect effect through operations performance. The total impact of product variety on sales initially is positive, although at a diminishing rate. However, beyond a certain level, increased product variety actually results in lower sales; that is, "too much of a good thing". Thus, the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of product variety on operations and sales performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research examines both general and outcome-specific operations management efforts and their impact on delivering quality healthcare. We empirically test a conceptual framework of safety culture that accounts for the use of general quality practices as well as outcome-specific approaches in light of the general and more focused climates in which those practices are embedded. We utilize structural equation modeling to analyze a unique pairing of primary data from a survey of quality improvement directors and chief nursing officers at 272 hospitals across the U.S. with secondary data on process of care performance publicly reported by the federal government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). General safety climate and quality practices are found to establish an environment in which outcome-specific efforts enable process quality improvement. A split-group SEM analysis highlights significant differences in managing healthcare safety outcomes through climate and practices. In particular, the employment of practices focused on the specific outcome goals is found to relate to higher quality of patient care in smaller hospitals. In contrast, the development of a climate focused on specific outcome goals is found to relate to higher quality of patient care in larger hospitals. These findings suggest alternative approaches for small and large hospitals in the critical effort to improve patient safety and reduce healthcare costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The findings indicate that the higher the supply chain fit, the higher the Return on Assets (ROA) of the firm, and that firms with a negative misfit show a lower performance than firms with a positive misfit.

It proposes a model that integrates multiple considerations germane to global supply chains. Postponement is important in this context because it is necessary to consider international transfers and tariffs, and it is important to appropriately account for the impact of postponement on total costs. Consideration of several key variables such as shipping point, customs tariff, and cost differences between countries is essential to derive full benefits from postponement strategy in global supply chains. International transfer of goods among countries in global automobile industry is complex and dynamic because of the multitude of factors that must be considered. The paper develops insights regarding postponement strategy in global supply chains via a system dynamics simulation model. The model draws on the experiences of a Korean automobile manufacturer with operations in developing and developed countries. The results of the system dynamics simulations show that the choice of optimal shipping point and the right level of postponement under the "decoupling points" strategy in global operations has a significant effect on overall cost efficiency, when decoupling point and postponement timing are considered simultaneously. The results also show that there are key differences in executing the postponement strategy when shipping to a developing country as opposed to a developed country. This insight has practical implications for global operations and is helpful in developing a sophisticated framework for executing the postponement strategy as manufacturing firms expand their operations globally.

However, recent studies suggest that the operational challenges associated with meeting this objective may be heavily dependent not only upon a firm's internal modification, mix, and new product flexibilities, but also upon the flexibility of its inbound and outbound supply chain partners. Drawing upon the theory of Complementarity, we examine if simultaneous utilization of both internal and external flexibilities does in fact create synergies that can improve a firm's delivery performance. Based on a sample of 158 U.S. manufacturing plants, we find that the extent to which performance enhancing synergies are generated is primarily dependent upon the type of internal flexibility that is paired with supply chain flexibilities. Additionally, we find that when synergies do exist, external supplier and logistics flexibilities generally tend to enhance the scope of flexible response, while internal flexibilities generally tend to enhance the achievability of a flexible response. Taken together, our findings suggest that the ability of firms to actually reap the synergistic benefits of an integrated system of supply chain flexibility is much more complex and nuanced than previously believed or expected.

The mixed findings could be due to differences across firms in terms of the capabilities to acquire, assimilate, and transform knowledge and to simultaneously pursue both the exploitation of existing operational capabilities and the exploration for new operational capabilities. Building on the literature that suggests that manufacturing flexibility mediates the relationship between environmental uncertainty and firm performance, we explore the applicability of two organizational learning contingencies to the operations environment: operational absorptive capability and operational ambidexterity. Absorptive capacity enables the recognition and assimilation of new knowledge. Ambidexterity determines whether this knowledge will be applied for both exploration and exploitation. Using a sample of 852 manufacturing firms, we find that environmental uncertainty affects firm performance directly and indirectly through manufacturing flexibility. Furthermore, both operational absorptive capacity and operational ambidexterity moderate the relationship between environmental uncertainty and manufacturing flexibility and the relationship between manufacturing flexibility and firm performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Externally provided performance feedback in the form of cost information and non-financial performance indicators has no effect on the order of different forms of knowledge transfer. Moreover, external feedback does not even have an additional significant performance effect on learning new tasks irrespective of the type of knowledge transfer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We identify two sets of opportunities for pursuing radical innovations. First, there is an opportunity to pursue all phases of science, including exploratory and qualitative research, developing theories, causation and internal validity, and testing models and theories for external validity (the ability to generalize knowledge to other situations). This would broaden the domain covered by each research effort, minimize the bias resulting from the choice of research paradigm and research domain, to enhance external validity, and to minimize the gap between our research efforts and the real world our community seeks to reshape. Second, there is an opportunity to pursue multiple perspectives because a scientific conclusion valid for a narrow domain may prove to be partially true or even false if one obtains multiple perspectives. Multiple perspectives can be obtained by investigating different parts of the system, by employing different methods of analysis, by using different sources of data, or by using different subsets of the same data.

Interestingly, significant contributions in the academic literature offer consistent evidence that the use of mediated power has a negative impact on the quality of inter-organizational relationships. Yet, there is a dearth of empirical research investigating the conditions under which the use of mediated power is more or less prevalent. Utilizing dyadic data collected on 102 outsourcing relationships, this study evaluates how the buying firm's dependence on the service provider, asserted importance of the outsourced activity, and difficulties with other inter-organizational control mechanisms are related to their reliance on mediated power. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis support the hypotheses that the use of mediated power is diminished when the buyer is currently more dependent on the service provider due to switching difficulties and the buyer has a higher expectation of future supply market consolidation. Similar hypotheses regarding the effect of the strategic importance of the outsourced activity and entry barriers to the service provider's market were not supported. The results also support the hypothesis that the use of mediated power is more pronounced when the buyer experiences contract management difficulties, but the same is not true when the buyer has difficulty in monitoring the provider. To our knowledge, these findings represent the first empirical explanation of conditions which either attenuate or exacerbate the use of mediated power by outsourcing organizations.

WOS:000300964900001	Case/field study; Organisational behavior; Productivity; Service operations	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERSPECTIVE; DESIGN; FIRMS; WORK	1-2	This paper presents detailed analysis of the operational and operations management characteristics of a professional service firm, a legal partnership. An in-depth study of customer interactions, service customization, process throughput and variability, professional employee behavior and managerial interventions provided the basis for confirmatory and exploratory research. The results suggested a number of refinements to existing conceptualizations of the professional service type operation and indicated areas where professional service operations management should be viewed as highly distinctive. First, professional-client exchange is variably asymmetrical - with significant implications for service package and process design. Second, professional service operations comprise a substantial number of less variable and faster throughput processes - creating a significant opportunity for commoditization. Third, professional status and corresponding organisational structures (e.g. the partnership model) need to be explicitly recognised in any typology - these factors introduce distinctive trade-offs when seeking greater efficiency and effectiveness.

It contributes to the contingency theory of QM effectiveness. Drawing on the management literature, we differentiate two different groups of QM practices: Quality Exploitation and Quality Exploration. The analysis empirically investigates the internal fit with organizational structure and the external fit with environmental uncertainty on the relationship between Quality Exploration, Quality Exploitation, and operational performance. The data comes from a survey of 238 manufacturing plants in three industries across eight countries. Regression analyses show that both internal fit with the organizational structure and external fit with the environment affect performance. The findings also provide insights for managers on how to customize QM programs to achieve optimal performance benefits. In stable environments Quality Exploitation practices provide the best performance outcomes, while in a dynamic environment Quality Exploration practices with an organic organizational structure give the best results.

We review all prior studies that assessed journal outlets for OM research and compare all previous OM journal quality rankings to rankings based on impact factors. We find that rankings based on impact factors that use data from different time periods are highly correlated and provide similar rankings of journals using either two-year or five-year assessment periods, either with or without self-citations. However, some individual journals have large rank changes using different impact factor specifications. We also find that OM journal rankings based on impact factors are only moderately correlated with journal quality rankings previously determined using other methods, and the agreement among these other methods in ranking the quality of OM journals is relatively modest. Thus, impact factor rankings alone are not a replacement for the assessment methods used in previous studies, but rather they evaluate OM journals from another perspective. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Further, we examine whether availability of organizational slack over the study interval interferes with the relationship between quality practices and process performance. Organizational slack consists of the available and accessible resources in an organization; we focus here on unabsorbed slack in the form of financial resources. We investigate the quality practices of U.S. general acute care hospitals, measured by their depth of implementation of practices characterizing a total quality management system, and use them to predict process performance related to four medical conditions. Analysis reveals differing effects that are dependent on hospital slack conditions. In hospitals with high slack, quality practices significantly predict three of four studied process performance measures. In contrast, in hospitals with low slack, quality practices predict only one of the four process performance measures, while other factors outweigh the effects of quality practices. This study lends support to management taking a long-term perspective related to implementation of quality management systems, and highlights the relevance of slack conditions in garnering the benefits of such systems.

Indeed, economic theory regarding the factors which influence the outsourcing decision, treats opportunism as a core behavioral assumption. It is assumed that if given the opportunity, outsourcing providers will act in a self-serving manner despite the potentially negative impact it may have on their customer. Other researchers have suggested that opportunism is not an unwavering human behavior, but rather can be substantively influenced by the management practices which define the relationship. Building on these arguments, this study investigates the validity of these divergent positions. Hierarchical linear regression is used to examine dyadic data on 102 information technology, logistics, and other business process outsourcing relationships. We test a model which hypothesizes that the buying firm's reliance on different bases of inter-firm power will have differing effects on the risk of opportunism (shirking and poaching). These hypotheses are evaluated while concurrently examining the influence of exchange hazards (relationship-specific investments and technological uncertainty) on provider shirking and poaching. The results offer strong evidence that buyer reliance on mediated forms of power (i.e. rewards, coercive, legal legitimate) enhance the risk of both provider shirking and poaching, while non-mediated power (i.e. expert, referent) is associated with a diminished level of opportunistic behavior. Interestingly, relationship-specific investments have a significant effect on some forms of opportunistic behavior but not on other forms of opportunistic behavior. Technological uncertainty did not have a significant impact on provider opportunism. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While the link between EM practices and firm performance has been well studied, little is known about the competitive drivers of a firm's EM activities. In this research, a Schumpeterian economics perspective is adopted to investigate competitive interactions among leader and challenger firms in the domain of EM, with a particular focus on operational EM activities. Using econometric methods, the empirical analysis of panel data from a broad cross-section of US manufacturing firms reveals that such rivalry does exist and that the effect of a rival's past EM activity on a focal firm's EM activity is greater for more profitable and smaller firms. In addition, firm characteristics such as market leadership, firm size and firm profitability are found to significantly affect the magnitude of a firm's EM activities. This study presents theoretical and empirical evidence of rivalrous behaviors in the domains of EM and OM and, thus, has interesting implications for operations management research and practice.

Our analysis of survey data on a firm's supplier portfolio for a major product line indicates that the impacts of process alignment and partnering flexibility on competitive performance are moderated by the three supplier portfolio characteristics. Specifically, while concentrated relationship portfolios, long-term relationships, and supplier substitutability amplify the positive effect of process alignment on competitive performance, concentrated relationship portfolios and long-term relationships attenuate the competitive benefits that firms derive from partnering flexibility. While long-term relationships and concentrated supplier portfolios enhance the competitive benefits of process alignment, operations managers also need to recognize the detrimental effects of these supplier portfolio characteristics on the competitive benefits of partnering flexibility.

Journal of Operations Management 2001, 19 (2) pp. 185-200]. Using survey responses from 403 supply chain professionals, we compare the arcs of integration group memberships generated with our sample to the original study, rationalize the classification scheme, and assess the impact of supply chain integration strategies on quality, delivery, flexibility and cost performance. In doing so we cross-validate Frohlich and Westbrook's framework with a more recent and broader sample of data utilizing multi-dimensional performance measures collected from supply chain managers. We ground these relationships in the relational and resource-based views of the firm. We also extend Frohlich and Westbrook's study by investigating the moderating role of internal integration on the relationships between arcs of integration and performance. In accordance with information processing theory, the results indicate that internal integration strengthens the positive impacts of external integration on both delivery and flexibility performance. However, the theory is not supported for either quality or cost performance. Overall, our study confirms and extends the work of Frohlich and Westbrook, augments theories used to describe supply chain integration efforts, and provides practical implications for managers.

Using technology-based services in the public sector as the setting, we identified the key service attributes driving adoption and use of transactional e-government services, and citizens' preference structures across these attributes. After identifying four key attributes, i.e., usability, computer resource requirement, technical support provision and security provision, we conducted a Web-based survey and a conjoint experiment among 2465 citizens. In a two-stage Web-based survey, citizens reported their perceptions about a smartcard technology for transactional e-government services before use, and their use and satisfaction 4 months later. Results showed that the key attributes (noted above) influenced citizens' intentions, subsequent use and satisfaction. In the conjoint experiment, citizens reported their preferences for key service attributes for two transactional e-government services. Further, a cluster analysis uncovered four distinct citizen segments, i.e., balanced, usability-focused, risk-conscious and resource-conservative, that can inform efforts in designing e-government services. A post hoc analysis confirmed the appropriateness of the market segmentation in understanding citizens' adoption and use of transactional e-government services. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Research shows that ambidextrous organizations can better manage these dual demands, but our understanding of the antecedents that lead to ambidexterity is still emerging. In addition, previous research has taken a piecemeal approach to understand ambidexterity and does not fully consider its multilevel nature. This research takes a multilevel perspective and argues that a competency in ambidexterity involves three capabilities at different organizational levels: decision risk (strategic level), structural differentiation (project level), and contextual alignment (meso level). After correcting for endogeneity we empirically examine the relationship between these antecedents and ambidexterity competency by collecting multi-level data from 34 high tech business units and 110 exploration and exploitation R&D projects. The results indicate that decision risk and contextual alignment affect ambidexterity competency for high tech organizations. Structural differentiation does not affect ambidexterity competency but has mixed effects on R&D project performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given this state, the lackluster performance of an alarmingly high proportion of outsourcing initiatives is somewhat surprising. In an effort to achieve aggressive cost savings objectives, many outsourcing engagements are associated with organizational resources being disposed of which can lead to a significant operational capability loss on the part of the outsourcing firm. Surprisingly little empirical research has dealt with the issues arising from this capability loss frequently associated with outsourcing. This study strives to address this void. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, this study investigates the direct impact that capability loss has on outsourcing performance, and also the impact it has on the outsourcing firm's ability to effectively manage its relationship with the outsourcing provider. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis on 198 outsourcing initiatives suggest an inadequate capability evaluation up front can lead to a more substantive capability loss. Subsequently, we find that a more extensive capability loss has a direct negative effect on outsourcing performance. Prior studies have established the significant positive effect that developing a committed and cooperative relationship with the provider has on outsourcing performance. Our results corroborate these previous findings, and also demonstrate that capability loss inhibits the outsourcing firm's efforts to develop a committed and cooperative relationship with the outsourcing provider.

These relate to the operational performance of cardiology units and capture the timeliness and cost efficiency of cardiac care. We also investigate the complementary role played by the experiential quality in enhancing the impact of clinical quality and clinical flexibility on operational performance measure. Experiential quality relates to patient-centered delivery of care by a hospital. We collect and combine data for 876 U.S. hospitals from four distinct sources and undertake multi-level analyses that consider a hierarchical structure in which the hospital is nested within county and state. To disentangle the effects at the levels of states, counties, and hospitals, we use the mixed-effects modeling approach. The results obtained from econometric analyses indicate that clinical quality and clinical flexibility reduce cardiology unit average length of stay. Clinical flexibility also helps in reducing the average cost of cardiology units. Experiential quality moderates the impact of clinical quality on length of stay and plays a complementary role in the relationship between clinical flexibility and cost. The paper discusses the implications of the findings and presents directions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We test our theoretical model with a sample of 214 buyer-supplier joint new product development projects. Results suggest that communication intensity is positively associated with project performance when either task or relational uncertainty is high, but is also negatively associated with performance when task uncertainty is low. Goal congruence is positively associated with project performance, especially when either task uncertainty is low or relational uncertainty is high. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To increase responsiveness, supply chain managers often seek information that provides greater visibility into factors affecting both demand and supply. Managers often claim, however, that they are awash in data yet lacking in valuable information. Taken together, these conditions suggest that supply chain visibility is a necessary, but insufficient capability for enabling supply chain responsiveness. Based on organizational information processing theory, we posit that a supply chain organization's internal integration competence provides complementary information processing capabilities required to yield expected responsiveness from greater supply chain visibility. An analysis of data from 206 firms strongly supports this hypothesis. For supply chain managers, these findings indicate that a strategy for achieving supply chain responsiveness requires a dual-pronged approach that aligns increased visibility with extensive information processing capabilities from internal integration. For researchers, this study provides an initial examination of visibility as a construct, and extends a growing literature addressing integration as an information processing capability.

However, the most influential models in the field attempt to explain this alignment without regard to the core resource allocation choices relating operational capabilities to different service offerings. To further our understanding of service operations alignment, we apply a unique combination of experimental scenarios and discrete choice modeling to measure the role of managers in orchestrating operational capabilities. Using the third-party logistics tender review and bid preparation process as an empirical setting, we reveal the resource allocation choices that managers make between six distinctive operational capabilities (customer engagement, cross-functional coordination, creative solutions, operations improvement, IT infrastructure and professional delivery) and show the subtle ways in which these capabilities interact as the service context moves from one based on commoditization to one based on customization.

Breach of a psychological contract can negatively affect work behaviors and attitudinal perceptions, and may also elicit an emotional response (violation) which can help to explain these negative consequences. This research focuses on the role of psychological contracts in a supply chain setting. We explore when and how three conditions of psychological contract breach - attribute, severity, and timing - negatively impact outcomes, and assess the mediating role of psychological contract violation in this relationship. To evaluate our hypotheses, we employ a laboratory experiment in which participants assume the role of a purchasing manager. We impose various breach factors and observe their relative impact on the decision-making behavior and fairness perceptions of the participant. We show that while the breach factors significantly impact task behavior, these relationships are not explained by psychological contract violation. However, violation is useful in explaining, in part, the results pertaining to fairness perceptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper hopes to inspire more theorizing engagements through the formal process of metaphorical transfer. Metaphorical transfer transforms casually-invoked metaphors in everyday language into theory-constitutive metaphors. This transformation process first mandates theorizing to ensure equivalence between the domain of the metaphor and that of a target phenomenon or research problem of interest. Second, theorizing during metaphorical transfer occurs when abstracted insights intended to govern both the metaphor and target phenomenon materialize. Finally, metaphorical transfer supports borrowing of theories from outside of OM/SCM for testing within OM/SCM by safeguarding against common mistakes. This paper demonstrates metaphorical transfer via the example of divorce and strategic buyer-supplier relationship dissolution and concludes by highlighting other metaphors that may be invoked for a number of exemplary supply chain relationship phenomena.

Wing an operational-level panel data for nine product lines over 2.5 years, we empirically examine the learning curves in CPFR between Motorola, a mobile phone manufacturer, and one of its U.S.-based national retail partners. We found that the two key components of CPFR, collaborative forecasting (CF) and collaborative replenishment (CR), exhibit distinct learning curves. Forecast accuracy improves immediately following CPFR implementation but the rate of improvement slows over time, whereas inventory levels increase at first and begin decreasing after a period. Further, we found different learning effects in terms of inventory levels when products are later replaced with new form factors. Product replacements have lower inventory levels than their antecedents, at least for low-end products. We discuss important implications for theory and practice at the interface of information systems and operations management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As such, firms expend considerable effort in managing their inventories efficiently. Among other factors, information technology (IT) capability can play an important role in enabling inventory efficiency and financial performance. However, insight into the chain-of-effects linking IT capability, inventory efficiency, and stock market returns and risk remains limited. In this paper, we provide a conceptual model outlining the relationships between these constructs. Next, we evaluate the model using secondary information on firms from multiple industries across the 10-year time period of 2000-2009. Our analysis confirms that firms' IT capability plays a significant role in enhancing their inventory efficiency, which, in turn, is observed to increase stock market returns. Our results also reveal that firms' IT capability directly reduces their stock market risk and enhances their stock market returns. Taken together, these findings, along with the conceptual model that we advance, have important research and managerial implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to examine the extent to which value generated by information systems for collaborating versus transacting is contingent upon demand volatility. We analyze a unique dataset assembled from non-public U.S. Census Bureau data of manufacturing plants. Our findings suggest that when faced with volatile demand, plants employing information systems for collaborating with suppliers and customers experience positive and significant benefits to performance, in terms of both labor productivity and inventory turnover. In contrast, results suggest that plants employing information systems for transacting in volatile environments do not experience such benefits. Further exploratory analysis suggests that in the context of demand volatility, these two distinct dimensions of IT-based integration have differing performance implications at different stages of the production process in terms of raw-materials inventory and finished-goods inventory, but not in terms of work-in-process inventory. Taken together, our study contributes to theoretical and managerial understanding of the contingent value of information systems in volatile demand conditions in the supply chain context.

As a result, they have improved their ability to coordinate and synchronize shared business processes by using more complete, accurate, and timely information. These electronic linkages are based on open-standard interorganizational information systems (OSIOS), which are fundamentally different from traditional electronic data interchanges. OSIOS capture not only the technical specifications for data interchange but also the sequential steps for the execution of shared business processes. Because OSIOS are still at an early diffusion stage, it remains unclear why firms would assimilate such an innovation and whether assimilation provides firms any benefits. In this research, we develop a framework grounded on the economics of standards, institutional theory, and strategic interorganizational information systems literatures to investigate the drivers and outcomes of OSIOS assimilation in a focused context. In order to test our hypotheses based on this framework, we used data from a high-technology supply chain and employed econometrics techniques. We found that both competition asymmetry across supply chain echelons and OSIOS assimilation within supply chain echelons predict individual firms' OSIOS assimilation. The results also suggest that firms' supply chain dominance is both a driver and an outcome of OSIOS assimilation, highlighting a mutually reinforcing process. In addition, our study reveals boundary conditions of the hypothesized relationships. The use of multiple theoretical perspectives, a unique dataset, and innovative statistical techniques to investigate OSIOS assimilation in high-technology supply chains contributes to the body of knowledge in both the supply chain management and management of information systems disciplines.

With intense competition for market share and profits, information systems and technology (IST) sourcing decisions are becoming increasingly important to eRetail firms to support continued growth and market responsiveness. Drawing on the contingency theory, we examine organizational and environmental factors that influence an e-Retailer's IST sourcing strategy of make versus buy in enabling its value chain activities, and we also look at firm-level performance impacts of 1ST sourcing decisions that involve bundling across value chain activities. We test the proposed model and hypotheses using a panel data set of 307 firms over the period of 2006-2010. The results show that firms that make transformative IT investments tend to source a smaller portion of IST for their eRetail value chain activities than firms that pursue automate or informate as their strategic role for IT investment. Capabilities are positively associated with IST sourcing. Firms experienced in e-Retail are more likely to build rather than buy their 1ST. In addition, we find mimicking behavior for IST sourcing among firms in the same merchandizer category. We find that IT strategic role is strongly associated with growth metric, whereas sourcing decisions predominantly impact operational performance measures. There is partial evidence that alignment between IT strategic role and IST sourcing decisions results in better performance effects. Moreover, complementary IST sourcing of synergistic marketing and sales activities positively impacts Web sales and conversion rate, but the sourcing combination of logistics, operations, and sales activities is associated with lower Web sales and conversion rate. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Enterprise systems provide firms with platforms for electronically integrating their supplier and demand chain activities. Spill-over benefits refer to the impacts that occur when IT investments in one organizational domain benefit performance in a different value chain side of the firm. Supply-side electronic integration (SEI) refers to the use of electronic means to integrate the exchange of information and transactions with suppliers through enterprise systems. In our research, we examine whether SEI generates spill-over effects on customer service performance, over and beyond firms' direct investments in customer-side digitization. We also examine whether structural attributes of the firm (e.g., vertical integration, diversification, and centralization) moderate the effects of supply-side electronic integration on customer service performance. Our analysis of a secondary dataset of InformationWeek 500 firms shows that SEI helps firms realize cost-savings in their customer service performance, especially if they are less vertically integrated. In addition, SEI investments help diversified and centralized firms achieve cross-selling with their customers. We also find that SEI is more likely to help decentralized and diversified firms achieve customization in their customer service activities. These results suggest that SEI helps firms achieve twin goals in customer service: cost reduction and revenue expansion. Overall, our research reveals how supply-side electronic integration could generate benefits in customer service performance in firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These functional capabilities operate at different levels in an organization's procurement process. We draw upon resource-and knowledge-based views of the firm to theorize that in this hierarchy of information technology-enabled procurement capabilities, the higher-level capability procurement integration competence-enables firms to develop and deploy a lower-level capability-digital procurement competence. Further, we theorize that the lower-level capability impacts procurement process performance directly and completely mediates the relationship between higher-level capability and performance. Thus, although performance is impacted directly only by the lower-level capability, the higher-level capability facilitates the development and use of the lower-level capability. Our research model is tested using survey data from a large sample of 412 manufacturing firms. The results provide' strong support for the proposed research model. In particular, we find that as hypothesized, the impact of procurement integration competence on performance is completely mediated by digital procurement competence. Our results suggest that when examined at the procurement process level, the impact of higher-level capabilities may be manifested completely through the lower-level capabilities. Theoretical and practical implications of the research are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we propose a research model based on a relational view, delineating the factors that influence hospital supply chain performance: trust, knowledge exchange, IT integration between the hospital and its suppliers, and hospital-supplier integration. Testing results of the research model based on data from a sample of 117 supply chain executives from U.S. hospitals show positive direct effects: (1) from trust and from IT integration to knowledge exchange respectively; (2) from knowledge exchange and from IT integration to hospital-supplier integration respectively; and (3) from hospital-supplier integration to hospital supply chain performance. The results also show the following indirect effects: (1) the influences of knowledge exchange and IT integration on hospital supply chain performance are partially and fully mediated by hospital-supplier integration, respectively and (2) the influences of trust and IT integration on hospital-supplier integration are fully and partially mediated by knowledge exchange, respectively. In addition, the results show the following moderating effects: (1) hospital system membership moderates the relationships between IT integration and knowledge exchange and between trust and knowledge exchange; (2) hospital environmental uncertainty moderates the relationship between trust and knowledge exchange; and (3) trust moderates the relationship between knowledge exchange and hospital-supplier integration. Implications of the study findings and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Organizations invest large sums in various types of information technologies (ITs) to manage operational knowledge. Because of their superior storage, processing and communication capabilities, ITs offer technical platforms to build knowledge management (KM) capabilities. However, merely acquiring ITs are not sufficient, and organizations must structure information system (IS) designs to leverage ITs for building KM capabilities. We study how technical and strategic IS designs enhance operational absorptive capacity (OAC) - the KM capability of an operations management (OM) department. Specifically, we use a capabilities perspective of absorptive capacity to examine potential absorptive capacity (POAC) and realized absorptive capacity (ROAC) capabilities - the two OAC capabilities that create and utilize knowledge, respectively. Our theory proposes that integrated IS capability, - an aspect of technical IS design - is an antecedent of POAC and ROAC capabilities, and business-IT alignment - an aspect of strategic IS design - moderates the relationship between integrated IS capability and ROAC capability. Combining data gleaned from a multi-respondent survey with archival data from COMPUSTAT, we test our hypotheses using a dataset from 153 manufacturing organizations. By proposing that IS design enables an OM department's KM processes, i.e., the POAC and ROAC capabilities, our interdisciplinary theoretical framework opens the "black box" of OAC and contributes to improved understanding of IS and OM synergies. We offer a detailed discussion of our contributions to the literature at the IS-OM interface and implications for practitioners. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extending this perspective across different tiers in the healthcare supply chain, we investigate how organizations in different tiers in the supply chain (i.e. hospitals, distributors and manufacturers) respond to institutional pressures when implementing IOS. How institutional dynamics unfold across multiple tiers of a supply chain is an uncharted area of research, and we take the theory-building case study approach using data collected from ten organizations. Because organizations are embedded in their respective tiers, our within-tier analyses are equivalent to cross-organization analyses. In this regard, the cross-case analyses occur at two different levels: at each tier level (i.e. across multiple hospitals, multiple distributors and multiple manufacturers) and across the supply chain (i.e. across all three tiers). The study shows how different institutional pressures such as coercive, mimetic, and normative manifest across the tiers. It also demonstrates how a differential mix of endogenous and institutional pressures lead to mixed organizational responses across the tiers. The propositions developed from the study enrich institutional theory arguments within the information systems and supply chain management disciplines. They highlight how the IOS implementation dynamics within and across different tiers in a supply chain result in heterogeneous rather than isomorphic consequences, thereby exposing the "iron cage" of institutionalization.

There has been limited research that. focuses on micro-level outcomes related to employees who actually execute SCM processes in organizations. These employee-level outcomes are important because successful implementation of SCM systems and processes hinges on SCM employees' support and commitment. I develop and test a model positing that SCM employees' perceptions of changes in their work process characteristics, i.e., process complexity and process rigidity, following a new SCM system implementation will influence their job outcomes, i.e., job performance, job satisfaction, job anxiety, and job security, and their perceptions of process outcomes, i.e., process performance and relationship quality. The model incorporates a holistic appraisal of the extent of change change radicalness as a mechanism between work process characteristics and outcomes. The model is supported in three studies conducted in the context of three different SCM system implementations (N=278, 282, and 304, respectively). In particular, I found that individuals perceived a significant change in their work process characteristics following an SCM system implementation, and changes in work process characteristics had a significant impact on job and process outcomes. These findings contribute to the information systems and operations management literatures and their intersections by offering insights on challenges related to IT-enabled SCM innovation implementation in organizations.

We differentiate between SES use for supplier selection and supplier governance, identify sourcing professionals' work process interdependence as a moderator for the impacts of SES use on job satisfaction, and suggest job satisfaction mediates the impacts of SES use on job performance. We conducted a field study of sourcing professionals' SES use at one of the largest consumer product companies in the United States, which has implemented an SES to innovate its sourcing professionals' work processes. Based on our analysis of the survey and qualitative data we collected, we found the impacts of both types of SES use (1) to be negative on job satisfaction when work process interdependence was high, (2) to be positive on job satisfaction when work process interdependence was low, and (3) to be mediated by job satisfaction for job performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the literature at the intersection of information systems and operations management as well as for the information technology enabled innovation of sourcing processes and, more generally, complex business processes.

We introduce and demonstrate the application of acceptability to evaluate complex economic mechanisms. In particular, we apply our approach to the evaluation of continuous combinatorial auctions, which represent a complex, sophisticated market mechanism that has not been generally available in the online marketplace but has the potential to enhance the economic efficiency of trade for assets with interdependent values. Such auctions are being increasingly used in industry, e.g., to procure logistical services. Intuitively, acceptance and usage of a complex mechanism can be fostered by a design that provides information and tools that meet the users' task demands. Based on prior research and an analysis of the auction tasks, we discuss practical and innovative information feedback schemes for reducing the cognitive burden of formulating bids in combinatorial auctions. Then, we use constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM) - which have been consistently shown to be key determinants of technology acceptance in the extant literature - to compare the acceptability of the mechanism under three different information regimes. In addition, we borrow constructs from marketing theory to assess the potential growth in adoption of the mechanism. We compare user perceptions of the three alternative designs in a laboratory experiment with over 130 subjects. Our study constitutes a complementary and novel approach in evaluating the design of complex economic mechanisms. Results indicate a higher adoption and usage potential of the mechanism with advanced information feedback, supporting the potential of combinatorial auctions as a user-acceptable market mechanism with appropriate feedback.

We explore the role of various contextual factors at the firm-level (i.e., technology intensity, labor productivity, and labor intensity) and industry-level (i.e., industry efficiency level, industry competitiveness, industry sales growth, and industry ISO 9000 adoption level) that potentially impact the efficacy of ISO 9000 adoption. We carry out a hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis based on objective financial data from 438 U.S. manufacturing firms. The results show that firms with low technology intensity, low labor productivity and high labor intensity reap more benefit from ISO 9000 adoption. Firms in industries with low efficiency levels, high competition, high sales growth and low ISO 9000 adoption levels also obtain more benefit from the adoption, Our research provides supporting evidence for the context-dependent proposition of ISO 9000 adoption. Given the significant costs and resources involved, it is crucial for operations managers to assess to what extent ISO 9000 might benefit their performance before embarking on the implementation process.

However, the role of justice in improving performance in supply chain relationships is an under-investigated subject in the literature. In studying the joint impact of justice dimensions, the traditional assumption is that the three forms of justice interact with each other in a multiplicative manner. However, this assumption creates a managerial problem as discussed in this paper. We outline a different view of how the justice dimensions interact with one another utilizing the constraining factor model (CFM). We show that the CFM resolves some of the problems arising from the choice of multiplicative interaction of justice measures on performance. Specifically, we demonstrate that an increase in procedural, distributive or interactional justice results in a significant and positive improvement in performance only if the specific justice dimension is the constraining factor in the relationship. Overall, our analysis suggests that all three dimensions are important and a high level of one of the justice elements will not compensate for a low level of another, a view that is put forward by a number of past research studies injustice. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of our findings. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We propose two measures of inventory dynamics: one metric to assess the fluctuations of quarterly inventories within the year and a second metric to quantify relative year-over-year inventory growth. Our results indicate that within-year inventory volatility (IV) and abnormal year-over-year inventory growth (ABI) are associated with abnormal stock returns. Both metrics cannot be entirely explained by common risk factors. We find that firms with high IV and low ABI have the best long-term stock returns, and that stock performance decreases monotonically with higher ABI values. Our results are robust to various control variables including size, book-to-market value, industry and prior performance. We therefore conclude that changes in inventory levels provide valuable insights into the risks and opportunities faced by a company. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The paper defines deprivation cost as the economic valuation of the human suffering associated with a lack of access to a good or service. The use of deprivation costs is evaluated with a review of the philosophy and the economic literature to identify proper foundations for their estimation; a comparison of different proxy approaches to consider human suffering (e.g., minimization of penalties or weight factors, penalties for late deliveries, equity constraints, unmet demands) and their implications; and an analysis of the impacts of errors in estimation. In its final sections, the paper conducts numerical experiments to illustrate the comparative impacts of using the proxy approaches suggested in the literature, and concludes with a discussion of key findings.

Contrary to the economic benefits expected, recent findings pinpoint implementation hurdles that lead to a potential performance decline, the so-called 'servitization paradox'. In this paper, we analyze this paradox by disentangling the value creation and value appropriation processes of 44 national subsidiaries of a global manufacturing firm turned product-service provider, in the 2001-2007 period. Our findings show that the firm under study is able to successfully transcend the inherent substitution of products by services and to enact complementary sales dynamics between the two activities. Moreover, labor-intensive services such as maintenance, which imply higher levels of customer proximity, further enhance product sales. Empirical results also reveal a positive yet non-linear relationship between the scale of service activities and profitability: while initial levels of servicing result in a steep increase in profitability, a period of relative decline is observed before the positive relationship between the scale of services and profitability re-emerges. These findings suggest the presence of initial short-term gains but also indicate the existence of a 'profitability' hurdle; profitable growth seems feasible only to the extent that investments in service capability are translated into economies of scale. In helping to clarify the performance implications of service innovation, our findings suggest pathways to sustainable growth through servitization for manufacturing firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, scant research has been devoted to examining information technology (IT) investment among hospitals and how it influences patient care and financial performance. Using the lens of the Theory of Swift Even Flow (TSEF), we present an operations management-based perspective on the effect of IT in streamlining hospital operations. Specifically, we examined the role of IT on patient flow and its consequences for improved hospital efficiency and performance. Analysis of data from 567 U.S. hospitals shows that IT is associated with swift and even patient flow, which in turn is associated with improved revenues. Interestingly, we find that the improvement in financial performance is not at the expense of quality because we find similar effects of IT and patient flow in improvements in the quality of patient care. Further, we observed differential effects of swift flow and even flow on various measures of hospital performance. Although swift flow affects financial performance, even flow primarily affects quality performance. Taken together, they have a mutually reinforcing overall impact on hospital performance. The implications of these findings for hospital decision makers are that patient flow is an important mediating variable that is affected by IT and can significantly affect the quality of patient care and financial performance.

In addition, manufacturers operate in ever more complex and volatile environments. This research investigates the effects of environmental complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing practices. It empirically examines these relationships using archival and survey data from 126 manufacturers. The results show that environmental complexity positively moderates the effects of lean operations and lean purchasing on performance. However, environmental dynamism reduces the benefits of lean operations on performance, but enhances the benefits of lean purchasing on performance. Robustness tests further confirm the contingent effects of complexity and dynamism on lean operations and lean purchasing. This research offers a more nuanced understanding of the effect of external environmental context on lean practices, and suggests that practitioners should carefully consider the external environment when implementing different types of lean practices.

There is a lack of studies, however, of the performance implications of strategically spreading manufacturing operations across the globe. In fact, most research on international manufacturing to date has generalized from findings by researchers that examine international diversification at the level of the whole value chain, rather than specifically looking at the performance impact of dispersing production operations. Building on the concept of international manufacturing diversification, we show that its relationship with financial performance is inverted U-shaped, and that this relationship is positively moderated by product diversification and co-location of manufacturing and sales activities in the same geographic market. We place the development of international manufacturing diversification processes in the context of the resource based view and transaction costs economics. Hypotheses are tested using data on 38 firms with home base in 15 countries and car and light truck production activities in 45 countries from 2002 to 2008. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Further, prior research has found that outsourcing organizations struggle to estimate accurately the so called "hidden costs" associated with managing these inter-organizational relationships. This is especially true of complex, globally distributed outsourced services. In this study, we use dyadic data on 102 outsourcing relationships to investigate how dimensions of task- and location-specific complexity influence the degree of control and coordination costs incurred by the customer organization. Results from our hierarchical regression analysis demonstrate that the scale of the service and the geographic distance between the customer and provider locations are associated with higher levels of both control and coordination costs. Task breadth and geographic dispersion are significantly associated with increased control costs, but not coordination costs. Counter to our expectations, control costs decrease with the degree of service customization, whereas both control and coordination costs are negatively related to the average cultural distance between provider and customer organizations. These findings contribute unique empirical evidence to the outsourcing, offshoring, and international service operations literature. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The supplier, endowed with all bargaining power, can neither fully coordinate the channel nor extract all of the channel profit. We report on a sequence of laboratory experiments designed to separate possible causes of channel inefficiency. The three causes we consider are inequality aversion, bounded rationality, and incomplete information. It turns out that all three affect human behavior. Inequality aversion has by far the most explanatory power regarding retailers' behavior.

Specifically, past research from psychology, behavioral economics, and other related fields suggests that the sequence effect can significantly impact a customer's overall impression of a service interaction. In this article, we test the influence that the sequence of discrete events separated by several days or weeks plays on customers' assessment of service bundles. If the relative importance of the sequence effect for discrete bundles is known, then a service designer and event scheduler can optimize and develop a better sequence of interactions for the customers, leading to higher satisfaction, loyalty, and repurchase. Using an extensive multi-year ticket purchase database from a world-renowned performing arts venue, we develop and test econometric models to predict season ticket subscription repurchase. The estimated models show that sequence effects do indeed play a significant role in determining customer repurchase of subscriptions. These results have important implications for effective service design and capacity planning for a wide range of service industries. This article suggests both managerial implications and future research opportunities related to sequence effects in service operations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the empirical results as to the relationship between supplier integration and time-to-market are ambivalent. To understand this important relationship, we incorporate two major recent developments. First, the literature has started to redefine supplier integration into two dimensions, supplier product integration and supplier process integration. Second, recent research has begun to examine spillover effects that extend beyond the direct costs and benefits of the supplier contract. Using survey data of 116 firms in the industrials, health care, and information technology industries, the results confirm our hypotheses and show that supplier product integration decelerates time-to-market while supplier process integration accelerates time-to-market. The results also show a positive relationship between supplier integration and the adoption of external technologies, which either decelerates or accelerates time-to-market depending on the level of internal exploration activities. Our research, thus, helps to open the 'black-box' of the relationship between supplier integration and time-to-market, and provides a theoretically grounded explanation to the apparent contradictory results in prior research about the influence of supplier integration on time-to-market. In addition, we contribute to research on spillover effects by emphasizing that information technology adoption and assimilation is an important spillover effect of supplier integration.

An important aspect of these behavioral drivers is that they may operate (at least in part) through emotions. Emotions influence behavior in ways that are relevant to performance in processes; for example, anger prompts employees to refuse cooperation, fear inhibits workers' willingness to take initiatives (for example, in continuous improvement), and shame motivates them to change behavior. This study provides experimental evidence that the social preferences systematically trigger emotions. This happens not "linearly" (more achievement of a social preference might be expected to cause more positive emotions), but rather in more complex patterns that regulate social relationships. Arbitrary (but earned) status signals trigger pride, while status achievement from being lucky does not. An externally (not by an own fault) caused status loss triggers anger and disgust. Not receiving cooperation by another person triggers anger, but more so if the cooperation failure violates a reciprocity expectation; the happiness form receiving cooperation by another person is attenuated by guilt and sadness is the subject itself has previously refused cooperation to the other person. Events happening to salient in-group members trigger emotions as if they happened to subjects directly, including if the in-group member behaves in an embarrassing way. These results are relevant for front-line managers because they help predicting and interpreting emotional reactions of employees: awarding or withholding status, offering or demanding reciprocity, and the creation of in-groups have emotional effects that depend on the context in predictable ways. Our results also contribute to theory by connecting literatures on emotions, decision making, and behavioral operations. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our structural equation model with cross-country survey data from 461 respondents in the United States and China reveals that (i) organizational, situational, and personal antecedents significantly influence the use of procedural rationality, (ii) procedural rationality is effective in reducing uncertainty in supplier selection decisions, and (iii) the reduction in decision uncertainty improves supplier decision performance.

The paradox states that although professionals with more expertise tend to decide in different ways, they often do not make better assessments than those with less expertise. We first replicate that this paradox exists in a context of the assessment of operational supply risks, and then show how the paradox can be understood as the consequence of process characteristics mediating the relation between expertise and assessment performance. Using an experimental setup, we had 234 OSCM-professionals assess the operational risk in two series of different business cases, and measured several characteristics of their decision-making process. The strength of our approach lies in the fact that the business cases were real-life cases from our database of purchasing transactions in the area of IT-purchasing. This allows a comparison of the risk assessments of the professionals with the actual supply risk as was known from the survey database. Our findings show that, contrary to what is often assumed, the OSCM-professionals with more expertise do not use less information while assessing, nor are they faster. Instead, our results show that specialized expertise goes with increased certainty about the assessments, and general expertise goes with an increased use of intuitive judgment. However, the net effects of these expertise characteristics on assessment performance are zero. In the case of specialized expertise this is because specialized expertise is itself negatively related to performance. In the case of general expertise this is because the net effects of the use of intuition on performance are zero. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

If poorly managed, the resulting disruptions in customer service and environmental problems incur enormous recovery costs, prompt large legal liabilities, and damage customer goodwill and brand equity. Yet, despite conventional wisdom that firms should improve their own operations by observing problems that occur in others' processes, significant operational risks appear to be ignored and similar losses recur. Using a randomized vignette-based field experiment, we tested the influence of organization-level factors on knowledge acquisition. Two organization-level factors, namely perceived operational similarity, and to a lesser extent, market leadership, significantly influenced the risk manager's likelihood of acquiring knowledge about possible causes that triggered another firm's operational loss. These findings suggest that senior managers need to develop organizational systems and training to expand the screening by risk managers to enhance knowledge acquisition. Moreover, industry and trade organizations may have a role in fostering the transfer of knowledge and potential learning from operational losses of firms. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, use of the systems varies. The price points that these systems generate through the analysis of demand forecasts are, by their very nature, imperfect prescriptions. Given the risk of forecast error in certain reservation contexts, hotel agents are often given the latitude to accept rate bids below the pricing prescriptions of these systems. The frequency and extent of such deviation is dependent in large part on the judgment of reservation agents, who in turn are influenced by their perceptions of how their actions will be viewed by higher levels of management. In this study, we use a laboratory experiment to investigate how different forms of continuous performance feedback influence agent decisions. More specifically, we consider both a revenue-focused metric as well as a metric framed around pricing-curve adherence as the basis of two feedback mechanisms of interest. In an attempt to provide additional insight, we also monitored physiological markers of stress and arousal to determine the emotional state of subjects. The purpose is to use such observations in support of theory regarding the impact of performance measure orientation on decision making. The results suggest implications for the practical use of continuous feedback in these settings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates the relationship between cognitive reflection and newsvendor decision making, testing experienced supply chain professionals and subjects affiliated with a university business school in a newsvendor experiment. We find that in high and medium critical ratio environments, individuals with higher cognitive reflection exhibit a lower tendency to chase demand. We also find that cognitive reflection is related to task outcome measures including average expected profit, average order quantity and order quantity variance, and that cognitive reflection is a better predictor of performance than college major, years of experience, and managerial position. These results suggest that cognitive reflection contributes to an understanding of newsvendor decision-making behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In high margin settings, males tend to order more than females, and they also tend to achieve higher profits. There are no gender differences in low margin settings. We show that the observed gender differences are partially driven by (or mediated by) gender differences in risk appetite. Males tend to prefer taking greater risk than women, and this leads them to order more in the newsvendor problem (in high margin settings). We show that the risk-ordering relationship is related to financial risk attitudes but not to social risk attitudes, and also that the effect is not driven by gender differences in affect, a likely alternative explanation for the results.

We believe acquiring labor flexibility is not sufficient; its implementation is an important intervening step when companies have to tackle accompanying technical and behavioral side effects of labor flexibility. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model in which we introduce an intervening variable to capture the implementation of labor flexibility. In addition, evolving human resource management practices that promote acquisition of labor flexibility are also examined in our model. Case studies in ten printed circuit board plants validated our model. Subsequently, survey data collected from 74 PCB plants was analyzed using Partial Least Squares method. Supporting the proposed model, the results show that the impact of acquired labor flexibility on plant performance is not direct but experienced through the sophistication of labor flexibility implementation exercised by the plant. Our findings also suggested that plants that emphasized process-focused training, provided greater job-rotation training, and designed positive reward structures, acquired higher labor flexibility.

The implication is that any operational system that has minimized inefficiencies is also more environmentally sustainable. However, in this paper we argue that the underlying mechanism is one of extending the horizons of analysis and that this applies to both theory and practice of operations management. We illustrate this through two principal areas of lean operations, where we identify how successive extensions of the prevailing research horizon in each area have led to major advances in theory and practice. First, in quality management, the initial emphasis on statistical quality control of individual operations was extended through total quality management to include a broader process encompassing customer requirements and suppliers' operations. More recently, the environmental perspective extended the definition of customers to stakeholders and defects to any form of waste. Second, in supply chain management, the horizon first expanded from the initial focus on optimizing inventory control with a single planner to including multiple organizations with conflicting objectives and private information. The environmental perspective draws attention to aspects such as reverse flows and end-of-life product disposal, again potentially improving the performance of the overall supply chain. In both cases, these developments were initially driven by practice, where many of the benefits of adopting an environmental perspective were unexpected. Given that these unexpected side benefits seem to recur so frequently, we refer to this phenomenon as the "law of the expected unexpected side benefits."We conclude by extrapolating from the developmental paths of total quality management and supply chain management to speculate about the future of environmental research in operations management.

A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer's sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early We characterize the manufacturer's sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late. We show that the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may be hurt by the retailer's having higher-quality information.

Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently. Our results suggest that unless firms jointly manage these online channels, they may find that adding auctions actually reduces their revenues.

This problem is commonly known in the location literature as the facility location problem with immobile servers, stochastic demand, and congestion. It is often set up as a network of M/M/1 queues and modeled as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (MIP). Because of the complexity of the resulting model, the current literature focuses on approximate and/or heuristic solution methods. This paper proposes a linearization based on a simple transformation and piecewise linear approximations and an exact solution method based on cutting planes. This leads to the exact solution of models with up to 100 customers, 20 potential service facilities, and 3 capacity levels.

This is a good thing, mostly. But it will be harder than people suppose, and it may have some adverse consequences. There are numerous technical and policy problems, including privacy and security issues. All these likely will be resolved, but only with time, experience, and money. Thus, it is unclear just how RFID will be used, just when various applications will become feasible. Also, as transaction costs decline, providers will be inclined to charge for things that are now free, such as public parks and congested roads. We may wait less at each transaction point, but such points may proliferate. Rather than obsess about this one technology, we should aim to think creatively about transactions and ways to improve them. Transactions affect our lives in many ways. A transaction is a process, not just an event. When people are involved, the process becomes intertwined with other intricate processes-product choice, social interaction, and the expression of power relations. RFID certainly offers the potential for improvement, but there are some lower-tech methods worth considering. This is not a systematic survey, but rather an essay, a sketch in broad strokes of an immense and varied landscape. Many topics are touched on lightly. The goal is to stimulate thought and discussion. More questions are raised than answered. In places the tone is personal, some might say eccentric.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement "supply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000" into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country's management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000.

Using multivariate stochastic orders, we generalize this statement to arbitrary distributions.

For broad classes of distributions with arbitrary marginals, we confirm that centralization or pooling of inventories is more valuable when demands are less positively dependent.

The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial.

Our objective is to gain insights into the linkage between the stages to facilitate optimal system design and decentralized system control. To this end, we develop a closed-form approximation for the optimal base-stock levels. The development consists of two key steps: (1) convert the service-constrained model into a backorder cost model by imputing an appropriate backorder cost rate, and then adapt the single-stage approximation developed for the latter, and (2) use a logistic distribution to approximate the lead-time demand distribution in the single-stage approximation obtained in (1) to yield closed-form expressions. We then use the closed-form expressions to conduct sensitivity analyses and establish qualitative properties on system design issues, such as optimal total system stock, stock positioning, and internal fill rates. The closed-form approximation and most of the qualitative properties apply equally to the model with a backorder cost, although some differences do exist.

All other things being equal, is an airline's expected revenue larger in the market with larger demand? If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis? In this article, we provide answers to these questions by studying the relationship between the optimal expected revenue and the demand distributions when the latter are comparable according to various stochastic orders. For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to "sell ups," we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.) For a problem with an arbitrary number of fare classes and independent demands, we show that stochastically larger demand distributions should be preferred. Numerical examples demonstrating the effect of parameterized demand distributions (with appropriate stochastic ordering) and dependence structures are also presented.

The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience. Convenient closed-form expressions for the overall performance as a function of model elements are derived when either the agent-retention distribution or the performance function has exponential structure. Management actions may cause the agent-retention distribution to change. The model describes the consequences of such changes on the long-run average staff experience and the long-run average performance.

Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvenclor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers' inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management's ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.

First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system's competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm's head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified. Under the transfer payment contract, the system optimal policy is the unique Nash equilibrium in the decentralized supply chain. Discussion on the relationship between our coordination scheme and existing methods in the literature is also provided.

In many such systems, procurement lead times for service parts are lengthy and variable, repair capacity is limited, and operational requirements change frequently-resulting in demand processes that are highly uncertain and nonstationary. As a consequence, it is common to have many items in short supply while others are abundant. In such environments, integrated real-time decision-support tools can provide significant value by reducing the impact of inventory imbalances and responding appropriately to the volatile nature of the demand processes. By "integrated" and "real-time," we mean (respectively) tools that simultaneously consider key aspects of the current state of the operating environment in deciding what items to repair, where to ship available units, and by what mode to ship them. In this paper, we develop an integrated real-time model for making repair and inventory allocation decisions in a two-echelon reparable service parts system. We formulate the decision problem as a finite-horizon, periodic-review mathematical program, we show it can be formulated as a large-scale linear program, and we develop a practical heuristic method for solving the problem approximately. By simulating the operation of a service parts supply chain, we demonstrate the value of employing integrated decision models over using separate repair and inventory allocation rules for a range of environments where inventory imbalances exist. We also show that our heuristic approach is highly effective and that its inventory allocation subroutine, used as a stand-alone tool for making distribution decisions, outperforms a commonly used inventory allocation rule in most circumstances tested.

We examine the case where a firm introduces multiple generations of a durable product for which demand is characterized by a demand diffusion process. Under fixed introduction costs, we consider the case where available product technology improves stochastically. As such, delaying introduction to a later date may lead to the capture of further technology improvements, potentially at the cost of slowing sales for the existing product (and a decline in market potential for the product to be introduced, given our focus on durable products). We specify a state-based model of demand diffusion and construct a decision model to solve the firm's introduction timing problem. By incorporating technology improvement in our model, we prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy governing the firm's product-introduction decisions. Numerical analysis reveals the influence of key model parameters on the pace of product introduction. Our model helps to explain the product-introduction behavior of firms and provides an alternative to previous explanations of IBM's introduction timing decisions for successive generations of its mainframe computers.

The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study. In the context of the former, we show that "resolving" the fluid heuristic achieves asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling.

We assume that the available production capacity is limited and that unmet demand is lost. We incorporate discretionary sales, when inventory may be set aside to satisfy future demand even if some present demand is lost. We analyze and compare partial planning or delayed strategies. In delayed strategies, one decision may be planned in advance, whereas a second decision is delayed until the beginning of each time period, after observing the results of previous decisions. For example, in delayed production (delayed pricing), pricing (production) is determined at the beginning of the horizon, and the production (pricing) decision is made at the beginning of each period before new customer orders are received. A special case is where a single price is chosen over the horizon. We describe policies and heuristics for the strategies based on deterministic approximations and analyze their performances. Computational analysis yields additional insights about the strategies, such as that delayed production is usually better than delayed pricing except sometimes when capacity is tight. On average, the delayed production (pricing) heuristic achieved 99.3% (99.8%) of the corresponding optimal strategy.

We also present a near-exact matrix-geometric procedure for benchmarking our approximation relative to two other methods proposed in the literature. Through numerical tests, we demonstrate that our method is superior, both for performance estimation and for policy parameter optimization. Using this technique, we then perform experiments that address the following issues. What proportion of the optimal total inventory should managers allocate to upstream production stages to minimize the sum of inventory and backorder costs? If managerial action could lower holding cost rate or add capacity, which stages of the supply system should be targeted for maximum net benefit? Such concerns have been the subject of several recent studies relating to supply networks with constant and random independent lead times. We shine light on optimal actions for serial supply systems that experience congestion.

However, the implications of increased flexibility on overall system performance are widely unknown. We develop analytical models and an optimization-based simulation tool to study the impact of increasing flexibility on shortages, production variability, component inventories, and order variability induced at upstream suppliers in general multiplant multiproduct make-to-order manufacturing systems. Our results show that 1. Partial flexibility leads to a considerable increase in production variability, and consequently in higher component inventory levels and upstream order variability. Although a modest increase in flexibility yields most of the sales benefits, production variability is reduced as more flexibility is added to the system. Consequently, investments in additional flexibility may be justified when component inventories are expensive, or simply by the benefits associated with the smoother production. 2. The performance of flexible systems is highly dependent on the capacity allocation policies implemented. Policies that evenly distribute product demands to the available plants lead to consistently better performance because they avoid the misplacement of inventories by replicating the performance of a single-plant system. These insights and the simulation tool can be used by practitioners to guide the design of their flexible production systems, trading off the initial capital outlay versus the sales benefits and the expected operational costs.

Industry practice and research to date suggest that approaches based on component commonality can substantially lower the costs of proliferated product lines, but at the cost of reducing product differentiation and revenues. We analyze a stylized model of a manufacturer who designs a product line consisting of two products for sale to two market segments with different valuations of quality. The manufacturer determines the component quality levels, the amount of effort to reduce production costs, and whether to use common or different components for the two products. Explicitly considering potential interdependencies between cost-reduction effort and quality decisions, we characterize environments where the optimal product line involving component commonality features products of higher quality and yields higher revenues. Counter to earlier research we show that it can be preferable to make those components common that, relative to their production cost, are attributed a higher importance by customers. Disregarding the interactions between commonality, production cost, quality, and effort decisions can lead manufacturers to offer product lines with excessive differentiation and inefficiently low quality.

Introducing cross-sales to a service center, however, needs to be properly managed as it could degrade customer service quality. Real-time customer and system information can be used to set the appropriate control policy for cross-sales to enhance profitability without causing undesirable service degradation for calling customers. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the value of using real-time information in selecting optimal control policies for cross-sales in telephone service centers. Specifically, we develop an introductory mathematical model to incorporate the use of two types of information, system status (queuing congestion) and customer profile (likelihood of purchase) in determining the optimal control policy to maximize the expected operating profit of the system. We hope to stimulate further research in this area by providing a groundwork for further modeling. We show that using more information increases a call center's operating profit. Improvements were dramatic for environments with intermediate utilization and high customer heterogeneity.

By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, as is the case in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier's reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier's order depends on its reliability.

In some cases, they classify customers as high or low value, serving the former with their in-house operations and routing the latter to an outsourcer. Typically, they impose service-level constraints on the time each type of customer waits on hold. This paper considers four schemes for routing low-value calls between the client company and the outsourcer. These schemes vary in the complexity of their routing algorithms, as well as the sophistication of the telephone and information technology infrastructure they require of the two operations. For three of these schemes, this paper provides a direct characterization of system performance. For the fourth, most complex, scheme the paper provides performance bounds for the important special case in which the service requirements of high- and low-value callers are the same. These results allow the systematic comparison of the performance of the various routing schemes. The results suggest that, for clients with large outsourcing requirements, the simpler schemes that require little client-outsourcer coordination can perform very well.

When a workstation fails, it stops operating, and so do all the other workstations upstream of it. The quality of the material trapped in the stopped workstations deteriorates with time. If this material remains immobilized beyond a certain critical time, its quality becomes unacceptable and it must be scrapped. We develop analytical expressions for important system performance measures for two cases. In the first case, the in-process material has no memory of the quality deterioration that it experienced during previous stoppages, whereas in the second case it has. In both cases, we assume that the workstation uptimes and downtimes follow memoryless distributions. We use the analytical expressions to numerically study the effect of system parameters on system performance. To evaluate the memoryless assumption, we compare the performance of the original model to that of a modified model in which the workstation downtimes do not follow memoryless distributions. The performance of the modified model is obtained via simulation.

This problem was first studied by Hall and Porteus (2000) using a dynamic game model. We extend their work by incorporating a general demand model, which enables us to obtain properties that reveal the dynamics of the game and the behavior of the players. In particular, we provide conditions under which the market share of a firm has a positive value and give it an upper bound. We further extend the game competition model to an infinite-horizon setting. We prove that there exists a stationary equilibrium policy and that the dynamic equilibrium policy always converges to a stationary equilibrium policy. We demonstrate that demand patterns will dictate how firms compete rationally and show the likely outcomes of the competition.

Because the product is ill defined at this point in time, the buyer is unable to commit to the future terms of trade through a court-enforceable contract. Instead, to provide incentives for capacity investment, the buyer informally promises future terms of trade. The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-cluantity promises and compare their performance. If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.

These papers then analyze the resulting competition among suppliers and mathematically characterize the equilibrium actions. There remains a question, however, as to whether the original customer models on which the analyses are built are reasonable representations of actual consumer choice. In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems. We find that some of the most analytically tractable models perform best in tests of model fit. We also find that the expected number of consecutive trials of a given supplier is increasing in its expected quality level, with increasing differences, a result consistent with the models' predictions as well as with loyalty effects described in the popular management literature.

A cross-industry exploratory investigation	WOS:000250945300005	econometrics; panel data; regression analysis; inventory	SUPPLY CHAIN; PRODUCT VARIETY; COST; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT; DEMAND; LINE; US	4	Classical inventory models offer a variety of insights into the optimal way to manage inventories of individual products. However, top managers and industry analysts are often concerned with the aggregate macroscopic view of a firm's inventory rather than with the inventories of individual products. Given that classical inventory models often do not account for many practical considerations that a company's management faces (e.g., competition, industry dynamics, business cycles, the financial state of the company and of the economy, etc.) and that they are derived at the product level and not the firm level, can insights from these models be used to explain the inventory dynamics of entire companies? This exploratory study aims to address this issue using empirical data. We analyze absolute and relative inventories using a quarterly data panel that contains 722 public U.S. companies for the period 1992-2002. We have chosen companies that are not widely diversified and whose business in large part relies on inventory management to concentrate on empirically testing hypotheses derived from a variety of classical inventory models (economic order quantity (EOQ), [Q, r], newsvendor, periodic review, etc.). We find empirical evidence that firms operating with more uncertain demand, longer lead times, and higher gross margins have larger inventories. Furthermore, larger companies appear to benefit from economies of scale and therefore have relatively less inventory than smaller companies. We obtain mixed evidence on the relationship between inventory levels and inventory holding costs. We also analyze the breakdown of data into eight segments-oil and gas, electronics, wholesale, retail, machinery, hardware, food, and chemicals-and find that, with a few notable exceptions, our hypotheses are supported within the segments as well. Overall, our results demonstrate that many of the predictions from classical inventory models extend beyond individual products to the aggregate firm level; hence, these models can help with high-level strategic choices in addition to tactical decisions.

First, we document that inventory holdings have been reduced. The median of wholesale inventory holding periods was reduced from 73 days to 49 days. Retail inventory did not start to decline until about 1995. Second, we document that firms with abnormally high inventories have abnormally poor long-term stock returns. Third, we illustrate these effects for the cases of Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven (Japan), and some related firms.

The objective of this study is to document the strength of the bullwhip effect in industry-level U.S. data. In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry's "production") is greater than the variance of the industry's sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less seasonal an industry's demand, the more likely the industry amplifies volatility-highly seasonal industries tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify.

One method that can be applied in such cases uses dispersion among forecasting experts as a measure of demand uncertainty. This paper provides a test for this method and presents a heteroscedastic regression model for estimating the variance of demand using dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale. We test this methodology using three data sets: demand data at item level, sales data at firm level for retailers, and sales data at firm level for manufacturers. We show that the variance of a random variable (demand and sales for our data sets) is positively correlated with both dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale: The variance increases sublinearly with dispersion and more than linearly with scale. Further, we use longitudinal, data sets with sales forecasts made three to nine months before the earnings report date for retailers and manufacturers to show that the effects of dispersion and scale on variance of forecast error are consistent over time.

Drawing on the system improvement and team learning literatures, we develop a framework of frontline system improvement and test it using survey data from 37 workgroups. We find that psychological safety-the belief that one can talk about errors without risk of punishment- and problem-solving efficacy-the belief that the organization will support employees' system improvement efforts-were positively correlated with frontline system improvement (FLSI). Surprisingly, felt responsibility was negatively associated with FLSI. These findings suggest that rather than relying on hiring motivated individuals, managers need to support employees' efforts to improve their work systems by creating a work environment where it is safe to talk about operational failures and responding to employee communication about operational failures. Doing this may result in higher levels of FLSI efforts and ultimately improve work processes.

We use quarterly data on all major carriers, available since the introduction of required reporting of service indicators to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Our analysis demonstrates two main points. First, the relationship between operational performance and profitability is contingent on a company's operating model; "focused" airlines show a link between late arrivals and profitability while full-service airlines do not. Also, capacity utilization is a stronger driver of profitability for full-service airlines than for focused airlines. Second, focused airlines outperform the rest of the industry in terms of profitability.

Using empirical data from multiple stores of a consumer electronics retailer, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, we highlight the extent to which store manager incentive design impacts store manager behavior and, consequently, retail performance. More specifically, we describe the shift in store manager behavior resulting from a change in incentives, which, in part, altered the importance of sales relative to inventory shrinkage in the store manager compensation plan. Store managers, following this change, directed less attention to the prevention of inventory shrinkage and more toward sales-generating activities and made different process choices within the store. We observed increases in the level of inventory shrinkage and sales within these stores. Controlling for alternative drivers of sales and inventory shrinkage, we find this change in incentive design to be associated with a profit improvement of 4.2% of sales. This work indicates that altering how store managers are compensated impacts retail performance. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of balancing the rewards given for different types of activities in contexts where agents face multiple competing tasks.

Although it is clear that self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization.

Anecdotal evidence and a growing number of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level operating capabilities critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i.e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level operating capabilities such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U.S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on operating capabilities and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm.

Information technology (IT) has been an enabler of manufacturing productivity improvement, but its effect on improving the productivity of innovation-intensive operational activities has been mixed. In this paper, we explore the pathways through which IT impacts project-level performance measured in terms of speed, quality, and cost. Specifically, in this exploratory study we seek to present a theory of how the fit between enabling IT and the core characteristics of the project impacts project performance. We test our research hypotheses empirically, using a relatively large, cross-sectional sample of project data. The central contribution is the development and testing of a research model to improve our understanding of the relationship between enabling IT-project alignment, project competencies, and project performance. In doing so, our study clarifies the role of information technologies in project management, providing insights into how to integrate IT into innovation-intensive operational activities for improving project execution competence and productivity.

Investment into productive resources is made before demand realization, hence the supply chain faces the risk of under- or overinvestment. The CM and OEMs differ in their forecast accuracy and in their resource pooling capabilities, leading to a disparity in their ability to minimize costs due to demand uncertainty. We consider two scenarios in which this risk is borne by the OEM and CM, respectively. We determine which party should bear the risk so that maximum supply chain profits are achieved. We investigate the effectiveness of premium-based schemes in inducing the best party to bear the risk, and conclude that they function well despite information asymmetry when double marginalization is not very high.

We show what types of coordination mechanisms allow the decentralized supply chain to generate aggregate expected profits equal to the optimal profits in a centralized system, and how the parameters of these (perfect) coordination schemes can be determined. We assume that the retailers face stochastic demand functions that may depend on all of the firms' prices as well as a measure of their service levels, e.g., the steady-state availability of the products. We systematically compare the coordination mechanisms when retailers compete only in terms of their prices, and when they engage in simultaneous price and service competition.

There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one. We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity Our results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how the model's inputs should be estimated.

In this paper, we consider a supplier-retailer supply chain in which the supplier starts production well in advance of the selling season, and the retailer is offered two ordering opportunities at different points in time. An early order is allowed before the supplier's production decision, and a late order is allowed after the completion of production and after observing the demand. When the two wholesale prices change, we illustrate how the inventory decision rights and ownership are shifted and/or shared between the two firms, resulting in push, pull, or advance-purchase discount contracts. We then characterize the complete set of Pareto-dominant contracts for any given two-wholesale-price contract. We find that Pareto improvement can be achieved when inventory ownership is shifted from individual to shared and sometimes vice versa. In the latter case, push contracts not only are more likely to offer Pareto improvement, but also can achieve higher supply chain efficiency than pull contracts. We also identify conditions that enable Pareto improvement by introducing a new ordering opportunity to firms that had been bound by a single ordering opportunity without renegotiating the existing wholesale price, and we demonstrate through a numerical study that the adoption of the new ordering opportunity can significantly improve supply chain efficiency. We show that such Pareto improvement is more likely to happen when demand is more volatile.

Over the last several years, B2B exchanges have attempted to provide supply for storable industrial goods with some degree of design specification (as opposed to undifferentiated commodities). Through this research, we elucidate some aspects of how speculative online exchanges with a small number of participants might behave and the impact they will have on the use of long-term contracts for supply. By endogenizing the evolution of spot prices in response to buyers' and their supplier's actions, we produce price fluctuations that exhibit significant autocorrelation in such markets. We show that participating buyers accrue network benefits as the number of participating firms increases through the inventory-pooling effects, resulting in reduced costs for them. However, a supplier acting strategically win counteract such benefits by restricting availability of goods to the spot market, sacrificing short-term spot-market revenue for long-term contract volume.

We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with due date assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions of the amount of a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The due date assignment methods studied include the common due date, the slack due date, which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted due dates, when each job may be assigned a different due date. For each combination of due date assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, due date values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and due date assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs.

The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated. However, as the number of suppliers increases, our model predicts that the retailer may be able to take advantage of both competition and diversification.

These changes are expected to have a significant impact on operating policies at those depository institutions that handle large volumes of currency. We describe two business models that capture the flow of currency between a bank and the Fed; the first model captures the current operations of most banks, while the second is expected to be adapted by many banks in response to the new guidelines. Motivated by our work with Brink's, Inc., to assess the economic impact that banks will sustain from these guidelines, we present a detailed analysis that provides managers of banks with optimal strategies to manage the flow of currency to and from the Fed for a variety of cost structures and demand patterns. Given this insight into a bank's optimal behavior, the Fed can also use our analysis to fine tune its guidelines to achieve the desired goals.

In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy. Finally, by comparing the costs associated with these policies and several benchmark systems, we quantify the true value of accurate inventory information, which may be provided by radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems.

Without loss of generality, we consider that transportation is done by a third-party logistics company, such as FedEx or UPS, which provides multiple shipping modes such as overnight, one-day, two-day delivery, and more. When the transportation time has to be short, clearly, shipping cost is more expensive than it could have been. How should a company schedule production for accepted orders so that the company can leave enough transportation time for orders to take slow shipping modes to reduce the shipping cost? We study this problem of integrating the production and transportation functions for a manufacturing company producing a variety of customized products in a make-to-order environment with a commit-to-delivery mode of business. Various realistic scenarios are investigated in increasing order of complexity. When partial delivery is allowed by customers, we provide both a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and a minimum cost flow model. We show that nonpreemptive earliest due date (NEDD) production schedules are optimal when partial delivery is allowed and shipping cost is a decreasing convex function with transportation time. When partial delivery is not allowed, we develop an MIP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. An efficient heuristic algorithm with polynomial computation time is provided for the NP-hard problem. It gives near-optimal production schedules, as shown via thousands of numerical experiments. We also provide models and analysis for other scenarios where shipping cost accounts for customer locations and quantity discounts.

Using an analytical model that focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous results and produce new structural insights. A novel transformation technique first enables us to establish the unimodality of the profit functions for both channel partners, under relatively mild assumptions. Further analysis identifies the necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal contract for the manufacturer (wholesale and buyback prices) is distribution free, i.e., independent of the uncertainty in customer demand. A specific instance of the above condition is also necessary and sufficient for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective. We then prove that the optimal performance of the decentralized channel for distribution-free buyback contracts depends only on the curvature of the deterministic demand part. In addition, some of the optimal decisions and relevant profit ratios for buyback contracts in our setting are shown to be identical to those for their deterministic price-only counterparts.

For full-time employees, a solution is characterized by a bid job, which consists of a five-day-a-week schedule, a lunch break for all shifts, and a set of WSG task assignments for each of the half-hour periods in a shift. In contrast, each part-time employee may be given anywhere from one to six shifts during the week, and each shift may vary from four to eight hours in length. To facilitate supervision, all employees must be assigned to a home WSG, but when idle time exists in their schedules, they can be redeployed to other WSGs for a portion of the day. One of the complicating and unique factors addressed in this paper is the existence of nonsymmetric movement restrictions between WSGs. For example, an employee whose home base is A may be permitted to perform tasks at B, but not vice versa. Because the full problem could not be reduced to a single model, a multistage solution approach was developed. In the first stage, an extended shift-scheduling problem is solved to determine the optimal number of employees and their shifts. The results are postprocessed. in subsequent stages to obtain lunch breaks, days off, and task assignments under WSG movement restrictions. In the implementation of the multistage approach, two alternatives were explored. The first was based on the idea of partitioning the WSGs into manageable clusters and then solving them in series. The second involved the direct solution of an integer programming formulation of the task assignment problem with home-base restrictions and WSG movement restrictions, but for a fixed workforce. An iterative scheme was used to adjust the size of the workforce until all constraints were satisfied and overall optimality was achieved. Testing was done with data provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mail processing and distribution center (P&DC) in Dallas. The computations showed that the second alternative always yielded the smaller workforce and was always able to find good solutions within 30 minutes.

Demand from each source arrives dynamically according to an independent Poisson process. The cost of fulfilling each order depends on both the source of the order and its fulfillment location. Inventory at all locations is replenished from a shared production facility with a finite production capacity and stochastic production times. Consequently, supply lead times are load dependent and affected by congestion at the production facility. Our objective is to determine an optimal demand allocation and optimal inventory levels at each location so that the sum of transportation, inventory, and backorder costs is minimized. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy. We show that the optimal demand allocations are always discrete, with demand from each source always fulfilled entirely from a single inventory location. We use this discreteness property to reformulate the problems as a mixed-integer linear program and provide an exact solution procedure. We show that this discreteness property extends to systems with other forms of supply processes. However, we also show that supply systems exist for which the property does not hold. Using numerical results, we examine the impact of different parameters and provide some managerial insights.

Therefore, its effective management must include the control of the timing of the delivery of each of the service's elements and the enhancement of the customer's experience between and during the delivery of the various elements. This paper provides a conceptual framework that links the duration of a service encounter to behaviors that have been shown to affect profitability. Analysis of the framework reveals a wide gap between the behavioral assumptions typically made in operations research (OR) and operations management (OM) models and the state of the art in the marketing and psychology literature. The central motivations behind this paper are (1) to help the OR and OM community bridge this gap by bringing to its attention recent findings from the behavioral literature that have implications for the design of queueing systems for service firms and (2) to identify opportunities for further research.

The literature only considers the issue of revenue generation in a very limited way, by allowing a job to remain unprocessed and its revenue contribution to be lost. By contrast, we consider three diverse practical situations where efficient scheduling affects revenue in much more general and realistic ways. First, we study two make-to-order environments where efficient scheduling increases customer goodwill, thus stimulating demand in different ways. Second, we study two make-to-stock environments where efficient scheduling creates inventory, thus also stimulating demand in different ways. Third, we study new product markets where efficient scheduling leads to a company becoming the first mover, and thus acquiring a larger market share. In each case, we provide both a computationally efficient algorithm for scheduling and a proof that a much more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist. For both the make-to-stock and make-to-order problems, we also describe heuristic approaches that are easy to implement, and we study their average performance. The results show that substantial benefits arise from considering the implications of efficient scheduling for revenue and net profit. The practical impact of our work is to demonstrate the importance of efficient scheduling, not only in controlling cost, but also in increasing revenue and net profit.

However, the solution of such problems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information security concerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniques to attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-en-hancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set.

In the presence of limited supply, buyers who choose to purchase at a lower price may face a scarcity in supply. Our focus is on the structure of the optimal markdown mechanisms in the presence of rational or strategic buyers who demand multiple units. We first examine a complete information setting where the set of customer valuations is known but the seller does not know the valuation of each individual customer (i.e., cannot exercise perfect price discrimination). We then generalize our analysis to an incomplete valuation information setting where customer valuations are drawn from known distributions. For both settings, we compare the seller's profit resulting from the optimal markdown mechanism and the optimal single price. We provide a number of managerial insights into designing profitable markdown mechanisms.

Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular upgradability can reduce the need for slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular upgradability and consider the implications for profits. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of product architecture with pricing and timing decisions for managing the introduction of rapidly improving products.

New research in behavioral OM is emerging to bridge the gap between traditional models and these newer observational findings.

This special issue presents seven interesting papers that reflect the wide range of current research activity in behavioral OM. These papers provide insightful and thought-provoking introduction to this new direction in OM research.

In contrast, this paper takes a descriptive approach and considers bounded rationality, in the sense that decision makers are prone to errors and biases. Our decision model builds on the quantal choice model: While the best decision need not always be made, better decisions are made more often. We apply this framework to the classic newsvendor model and characterize the ordering decisions made by a boundedly rational decision maker. We identify systematic biases and offer insight into when overordering and underordering may occur. We also investigate the impact of these biases on several other inventory settings that have traditionally been studied using the newsvendor model as a building block, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling. We find that incorporating decision noise and optimization error yields results that are consistent with some anomalies highlighted by recent experimental findings.

However, laboratory experiments show a "pull-to-center" effect: average order quantities are too low when they should be high and vice versa. We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is more likely to have been greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency.

In this context, the SLA is a commitment by a supplier to achieve a minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of SLA is an important, but understudied coordination mechanism. We focus on the impact of two contract parameters: the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, whereas lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer review periods are generally more effective than shorter review periods in inducing higher stocking levels. As in several earlier laboratory studies, the explanation lies in the improved feedback reliability that longer review periods provide. The primary managerial implication of our findings is that, in practice, longer review periods may be more effective than shorter ones at inducing service improvements.

For a decision process to be seen as fair, the people affected must have the opportunity to give input and possibly to influence the decision, and the decision process and rationale must be transparent and clear. Existing research has shown empirically that fair process enhances both employee motivation and performance in execution. However, work to date has not addressed why fair process is so often violated in practice. This paper breaks new ground by analytically examining the subtle trade-offs involved. We develop a model of fair process in a principal-agent (i.e., manager-employee) context, rooted in psychological preferences for autonomy and fairness. We show that indeed fair process will not always be used, and why the hoped-for benefits may be insufficient to convince management to use fair process.

We incorporate a detailed consumer channel choice model in which the demand faced in each channel depends on the service levels of both channels as well as the consumers' valuation of the product and shopping experience. The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior. We determine that the model accurately predicts the direction of changes in the subjects' decisions, as well as their channel strategies in response to the changes in the channel environment. These observations suggest that the model can be used in designing channel strategies for an actual dual channel environment.(1).

Yet most formal analytical models of operations assume that the people who participate in operating systems are fully rational or at least can be induced to behave rationally. Many other disciplines, including economics, finance, and marketing, have successfully incorporated departures from this rationality assumption into their models and theories. In this paper, we argue that operations management scholars should do the same. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of incorporating behavioral and cognitive factors into models of operations management and suggest fruitful avenues for research in behavioral operations.

We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic ( myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price "betting" strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20%.

Most catalogers and online sellers, in addition to some traditional retailers, use upselling often to clear inventories of slow-moving items. We investigate the pricing and discounting questions for such an item, which we call the promotional product. In our model, an arriving customer may purchase this promotional product or one of the other products that the firm sells. If the customer purchases one of the other products, the promotional product is offered to the customer, possibly with a discount. While deciding whether to offer a discount and, if so, how big a discount to offer, the firm uses the information that the customer has just bought a certain product with a certain price. We investigate how discounting decisions depend on the inventory levels, time, type of pricing policy in use, and the relationship between the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product and the other products ( negatively or positively correlated). In particular, we find that if the firm sets prices and discounts dynamically and the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are negatively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then customers are always offered a discount regardless of the inventory levels and time. On the other hand, if the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are positively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then the customer may or may not be offered a discount, depending on the inventory levels and time. Our numerical study shows that the benefit to the firm from using customer purchase information is high when the firm uses a static price, but chooses discounts dynamically. We also find that although dynamic discounting decisions bring modest improvements, setting the price dynamically seems to have a more significant effect on the firm's profits.

The firms play a two-stage game. First, each firm chooses whether to invest in mass customization, which would enable it to offer customized products that increasingly match each customer's ideal product as the chosen customization level increases. A firm that chooses not to invest in mass customization serves a standard product. Second, the firms competitively price their product lines. We characterize each firm's investment in mass customization and study its dependence on competitive position, as determined by its cost efficiency and perceived quality vis-a-vis its competitor. We find that the value of mass customization critically depends on the firm's competitive position. It may not be desirable even at zero cost due to its negative effect on price competition. A firm with an overall cost and quality disadvantage never unilaterally adopts mass customization. We show that allowing firms to set different prices for each product configuration leads to a broader adoption of mass customization compared to when they are restricted to uniform prices. However, a firm's chosen customization level may be higher with uniform prices. Our analysis also helps a customizing firm determine whether to target its process improvement efforts for a lower cost or a higher customization level.

We develop methods for interday and dynamic intraday forecasting of incoming call volumes. Our approach is to treat the intraday call volume profiles as a high-dimensional vector time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by singular value decomposition of the matrix of historical intraday profiles and then to apply time series and regression techniques. Our approach takes into account both interday ( or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday ( or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets. Our methods are computationally fast; it is therefore feasible to use them for real-time dynamic forecasting.

Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more pro. table for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option.

Customers may therefore substitute if their preferred products are not offered. These individual customer choice decisions are modeled as a very general stochastic sequence of customers, each of whom has an ordered list of preferences. Minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. We assume that the firm controls the availability of products using a virtual nesting control strategy and would like to optimize the protection levels for its virtual classes accounting for the ( potentially quite complex) choice behavior of its customers. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity approximation for this problem, which allows for the partial acceptance of requests for products. The model admits an efficient calculation of the sample path gradient of the network revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show the algorithm converges in probability to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The algorithm is relatively efficient even on large network problems, and in our simulation experiments it produces significant revenue increases relative to traditional virtual nesting methods. On a large-scale, real-world airline example using choice behavior models fit to actual booking data, the method produced an estimated 10% improvement in revenue relative to the controls used by the airline. The examples also provide interesting insights into how protection levels should be adjusted to account for choice behavior. Overall, the results indicate that choice behavior has a significant impact on both capacity control decisions and revenue performance and that our method is a viable approach for addressing the problem.

An alternative solution, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to use a math program ( MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given set of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should an appropriate modi. cation of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventory- and revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive lead time.

Under rather general assumptions (spatially distributed continuous demand, general arrival and service processes, and nonlinear location and capacity costs) we show that the problem can be decomposed, and construct an efficient optimization algorithm. The analysis yields several insights, including the importance of equitable facility configurations (EFCs), the behavior of optimal and near-optimal capacities, and robust class of solutions that can be constructed for this problem.

The problem is motivated by production planning at a leading U.S. automotive pressure hose manufacturer. One method finds all Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize total production rate variation of models and work in process (WIP), and maximize system utilization and responsiveness. These Pareto-optimal solutions are found efficiently in polynomial time with respect to total demand by an algorithm proposed in the paper. The other method relies on Daniel Webster's method of apportionment for production smoothing, which produces periodic, uniform, and reflective production sequences that can improve operations management of the JIT systems. Finally, the paper presents the results of a computational experiment with the two methods.

An earlier study observed that decision makers tend to anchor their orders around average demand and fail to adjust sufficiently toward the expected profit-maximizing order. Principles of behavioral theory suggest some relatively simple interventions into the decision maker's experience and feedback that might improve performance, and these guide our investigation. The results imply that the institutional organization of experience and feedback may have a significant influence on whether inventory is stocked optimally.

The basic research questions are whether the Nash equilibrium exists in this game, whether it is unique, and how the resulting inventories and prices are affected by competition. Using a novel method, we show the quasiconcavity of the competitive newsvendor's problem and establish the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Through a contraction mapping approach, we develop sufficient conditions for the Nash equilibrium to be unique. We then analyze the properties of the equilibrium and compare it with the optimal solution for the (noncompeting) price-sensitive newsvendor. We prove that at a symmetric equilibrium, retail prices and safety stocks strictly increase with the proportion of a newsvendor's unsatisfied customers that switch to a competitor, but strictly decrease with the intensity of price competition. Total inventories, on the other hand, increase with the intensity of price competition. Furthermore, the competitive equilibrium never has lower safety stocks and higher retail prices ( a situation that definitely hurts the customers) than the solution for noncompetitive newsvendors.

The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved ( but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: ( 1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; ( 2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and ( 3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit.

Specifically, it was found that reduction in mean setup times without any change in variance can, paradoxically, increase waiting time and work in process (WIP) in a cyclic production system. Setup time variance was demonstrated to play a central role because of the paradoxes it produced with the resulting harm to effective capacity. Subsequently, explicit formulas were derived for determining whether adding fixed forced idle time (but holding variance constant) would reduce waiting time and, if so, the optimal amount of idle time to add. However, research to date has offered little guidance to reduce setup time variance to improve waiting time. We show that a greater reduction is achievable by adding a variable idle time that is a nonincreasing function of setup time and thereby reduce the combined setup time variance. We provide explicit procedures for finding the optimal variable idle time as a function of setup time when the latter follows any finite discrete distribution. We also show how to implement our policy and show that our approach can improve waiting time even when other currently known approaches cannot.

The POLCA system is particularly appropriate for environments that involve highly variable demand and large product variety, which force small batch (or even one-of-a-kind) production. We propose a load-based version of the POLCA control system (LB-POLCA), which determines the POLCA parameters (release authorizations, allowed workloads in the loops) according to an advanced resources planning (ARP) system that adequately captures the stochastic behavior of the production system and enables fine-tuning and high-level optimization of the manufacturing lot sizes. We also discuss the implementation of an electronic LB-POLCA system in a metal shop of Spicer Off-Highway Products Division, a subsidiary of the Dana Corporation.

The supplier's performance, in terms of optimal cost, optimal stocking level, and implied service level, is investigated under different retailer replenishment sequences. We show that under many realistic demand distributions, it is optimal to sequence retailers according to ascending variability. Furthermore, if the retailers vary in magnitudes of their orders, then the optimal sequence is usually the one with descending magnitudes.

The mass customizer (MC) has a perfectly flexible production technology and thus can offer any variety within a product space, represented by Hotelling's linear city. The mass producer (MP) has a more focused production technology and therefore offers a finite set of products in the same space. The MP can invest in more flexible technology, which reduces its cost of variety and hence allows it to offer a larger set of products; in the extreme, the MP can emulate the MC's technology and offer infinite variety. The firms simultaneously decide whether to enter the market, and the MP chooses its degree of product-mix flexibility on entry. Next, the MP designs its product line-i.e., the number and position of its products-the MC's perfectly flexible technology makes this unnecessary finally, both firms simultaneously set prices. We analyze the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in this three-stage game, allowing firm-specific fixed and variable costs that together characterize their production technology. We find that an MP facing competition from an MC offers lower product variety than an MP monopolist to reduce the intensity of price competition. We also find that the MP can survive this competition, even if it has higher fixed cost of production technology, higher marginal cost of production, or both.

Motivated by a building-products retailer's practice of stocking large quantities of products to stimulate demand, we study inventory management and pricing policies when demand is uncertain but increases with stocking quantity. We first characterize the profit-maximization policy for a stochastic inventory model with a general inventory-dependent demand distribution and given price, and show that demand stimulation (by inventories) has the effect of increasing the target service level beyond the classical newsvendor model's critical fractile ratio. To underscore the importance of considering both demand stochasticity and inventory influence, we consider two functionally oriented benchmark policies-a demand-driven policy and a critical fractile policy-that might, respectively, represent marketing and inventory managers' viewpoints. Our numerical analysis reveals that the optimal policy can generate considerably higher profits than the two complementary functional perspectives. Moreover, we prove that the optimal stocking quantity always exceeds the critical fractile solution and can even exceed the demand-driven stocking quantity. We also address the problem of jointly optimizing both stocking quantity and price for demand-stimulating products using a multiplicative model to represent the influence of price and stocking quantity on the demand distribution for this model, we show that the pricing and stocking decisions can be determined sequentially, with the optimal policy setting higher prices and stock levels than both the functional policies.

This result has been proven in other studies under the assumption that inventory is perishable, so the myopic inventory level is equal to the Bayesian optimal inventory level with observed lost sales. We break that equivalence by considering nonperishable inventory. We prove that with nonperishable inventory, the famous "stock more" result is often reversed to "stock less," in that the Bayesian optimal inventory level with unobserved lost sales is lower than the myopic inventory level. We also prove that making lost sales unobservable increases the Bayesian optimal inventory level; in this specific sense, the famous "stock more" result of other studies generalizes to the case of nonperishable inventory. When the product is out of stock, a customer may accept a substitute or choose not to purchase. We incorporate learning about the probability of substitution. This reduces the Bayesian optimal inventory level in the case that lost sales are observed. Reducing the inventory level has two beneficial effects: to observe and learn more about customer substitution behavior and (for a nonperishable product) to reduce the probability of overstocking in subsequent periods. Finally, for a capacitated production-inventory system under continuous review, we derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the demand rate and probability that customers will wait for the product. (Accepting a raincheck for delivery at some later time is a common type of substitution.) We investigate how the choice of base-stock level and production rate affect the convergence rate of these MLEs. The results reinforce those for the Bayesian, uncapacitated, periodic review system.

In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the physical inventory level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of "freezing," in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular "zero balance walk" audit policy.

For electronic products, life cycles are measured in units of months, with 6- to 12-month life cycles being common. Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed.

[Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing "flexible products"-a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e. g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e. g., an origin-destination connection)-their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of " efficiency" developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci. 50 15-33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying " good" offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.

The retailers are supplied with a single product via some warehouses. In these warehouses, the ordered amounts of goods of these retailers become available after some lead time. At the time that the goods arrive at the warehouses, demand realizations are known by the retailers. The retailers can increase their expected joint profits if they can coordinate their orders and make allocations after demand realization. For this setting, we consider an associated cooperative game between the retailers. We show that this associated cooperative game has a nonempty core. Finally, we introduce a noncooperative game, where the retailers decide on their order quantities individually, and show that the set of payoff vectors resulting from strong Nash equilibria corresponds to the core of the associated cooperative game.

In this short note, we tighten their upper bound and use it within a beta approximation of the shortfall distribution to derive a policy whose costs average only 0.05% above that of the optimal.

Common credit terms are tantamount to a schedule of declining discounts (escalating penalties) that depend on how long the retailer takes to pay off the supplier's loan. However, issues such as which stocking policies are optimal in the presence of supplier-provided credit have been investigated only when demand is assumed deterministic. Nearly all stochastic inventory models assume either time-invariant finance charges or charges that may vary with time but not with the age of the credit. In this article we present a discrete time model of the retailer's operations with random demand, which is used to prove that the structure of the optimal policy is not affected by credit terms, although the value of the optimal policy parameter is. This is followed by a continuous time model, which leads to an algorithm for finding the optimal stock level. We also model the supplier's problem and calculate the optimal credit parameters in numerical experiments.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.

Bidding behavior is specified and proven to induce a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and a closed-form expression for the expected revenue of each auctioneer is derived. For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling-i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%-65% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling. Pooling's impact on revenue decreases with the number of bidders, suggesting that popular auction sites need not be overly concerned with mitigating bidding across auctions.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U. S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we and that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.

A pointwise stationary fluid model (PSFM) is used to approximate system dynamics, which allows development of practical policies with a manageable computational burden. Earlier work in more restrictive settings suggests that our method is asymptotically optimal in a parameter regime of practical interest, but this paper contains no formal limit theory. Rather, it develops a PSFM calculus that is broadly accessible, with an emphasis on modeling and practical computation.

This paper studies a manufacturer's multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assemblies. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different economic and demand characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted, in which market should the facility be located? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region.

We model this phenomenon as a two-period contracting game with two identical suppliers, a single buyer, deterministic demand, and uncertain production costs. The suppliers are distressed at the start of the game and do not have access to external sources of capital; hence, revenues from the buyer are crucial in determining whether default occurs. The production cost of each supplier is the sum of two stochastic components: a common term that is identical for both suppliers (representing raw materials costs, design specifications, etc.) and an idiosyncratic term that is unique to a given supplier (representing inherent firm capability). The buyer chooses a supplier and then decides on a single-or two-period contract. Comparing models with and without the possibility of default, we find that, without the possibility of supplier failure, the buyer always prefers short-term contracts over long-term contracts, whereas this preference is typically reversed in the presence of failure. Neither of these contracts coordinates the supply chain. We also consider dynamic contracts, in which the contract price is partially tied to some index representing the common component of production costs (e. g., commodity prices of raw materials such as steel or oil), allowing the buyer to shoulder some of the risk from cost uncertainty. We find that dynamic long-term contracts allow the buyer to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of default risk. We also demonstrate that our results continue to hold under a variety of alternative assumptions, including stochastic demand, allowing the buyer the option of subsidizing a bankrupt supplier via a contingent transfer payment or loan and allowing the buyer to unilaterally renegotiate contracts. We conclude that the possibility of supplier default offers a new reason to prefer long-term contracts over short-term contracts.

The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information). From numerical results, we obtain several insights into the value of advance demand information for both supplier and customers.

In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels. For example, we find that tracking product-based (as opposed to component-based) return information appears to provide much less value than tracking product-based demand information, and we explore the impact of the number of products, component lead times, and different patterns of component returns (joint versus independent returns, returns of common versus dedicated components) on the value of component commonality.

For these institutions, these events are making more urgent the decision of how to staff a check-clearing house to trade off efficiency and the expected costs associated with the risks of delayed checks, which include fraud and. oat costs. In this paper, we discuss how a team of executives at a major commercial bank (CB) and Carnegie Mellon University students and faculty engaged in conducting a model-based study of the CB check-clearing operations. This project culminated in the development of a simulation optimization model to systematically analyze the nature of the highlighted risk efficiency trade-off at CB. The firm used the model recommendations to obtain operations downsizing guidelines for its senior managers during the implementation of a strategic workforce reduction program at their check-clearing house. The managerial insights from the team analysis, and the specific model-based recommendations, enabled CB executives to balance risk and efficiency while planning the reduction of their check-processing workforce.

In our framework, the first order is placed at the start of the preseason and delivered at the start of the selling season; the second order is placed at or after the start of the selling season for subsequent delivery. Under this framework, the decision maker must make three interrelated choices: the first order quantity, when to place the second order, and the second order quantity. Our focus is on elucidating the optimal policy structure for the three interrelated decisions. By casting our models as sequential decision-making problems, we are able to reduce the optimization problems into sequential and embedded searches for the concerned decision variables that allow us to identify the conditions on the economic parameters and demand distribution to effectively facilitate the search for the optimal solutions.

Customers often choose the busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not. In an environment with random arrival and service times, customer behavior is reflected in the lengths of the queues that form at the individual servers. Therefore, queue lengths could signal two factors-potentially higher arrivals to the server or potentially slower service at the server. In this paper, we focus on both factors when customers' waiting costs are negligible. This allows us to understand how information externalities due to congestion impact customers' service choice behavior. In our model, based on private information about both the service-quality and queue-length information, customers decide which queue to join. When the service rates are the same and known, we confirm that it may be rational to ignore private information and purchase from the service provider with the longer queue when only one additional customer is present in the longer queue. We find that, due to the information externalities contained in queue lengths, there exist cycles during which one service firm is thriving whereas the other is not. Which service provider is thriving depends on luck; i.e., it is determined by the private signal of the customer arriving when both service providers are idle. These phenomena continue to hold when each service facility has multiple servers, or when a facility may go out of business when it cannot attract customers for a certain amount of time. Finally, we find that when the service rates are unknown but are negatively correlated with service values, our results are strengthened; long queues are now doubly informative. The market share of the high-quality firm is higher when there is service rate uncertainty, and it increases as the service rate decreases. When the service rates are positively correlated with unknown service values, long queues become less informative and customers might even join shorter queues.

Economic theory predicts that an oligopolistic market with unregulated but costly entry will experience excess entry and oversupply, not the undersupply observed in the market for influenza vaccine in recent years. In this paper, we examine the interaction between yield uncertainty, a key characteristic of many production processes, including that for influenza vaccine, and firms' strategic behavior. We find that yield uncertainty can contribute to a high degree of concentration in an industry and a reduction in the industry output and the expected consumer surplus in equilibrium. We use parameter values loosely based on the U. S. influenza vaccine market to numerically illustrate the impact of yield uncertainty.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace.

In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their valuations only after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e.g., using 100% money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e.g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings.

We present structural results that characterize the interaction between the decision to hold a sale and the inventory-ordering decision. We show that the optimal inventory-ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy; however, the optimal pricing policy can be quite complicated due to both the value and the cost of holding inventory and delaying sales. In our computational analysis, we find that compared to a fixed-price policy, we see an average gain in profit of almost 5% from optimally varying promotion and inventory decisions accounting for intertemporal demand, and we find that this potential profit gain increases as demand variability decreases. We also develop a heuristic based on deterministic pricing and find that it performs well relative to the optimal policy.

This can be accomplished in several ways, including online tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pickups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and have the same drivers visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements, together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length, de. ne a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we call the consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal mixed-integer program solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. We provide a technique for generating ConVRP benchmark problems from vehicle routing problem instances given in the literature and provide our solutions to these instances. The solutions produced by our algorithm on all problems do a very good job of meeting customer service objectives with routes that have a low total travel time.

The best-known example is the FASTPASS (R) system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.

Under assumptions about the forecasts, the demand process, and the supply chain structure, we show that safety-stock placement for such systems is effectively equivalent to the corresponding well-studied problem for systems with stationary demand bounds and base-stock policies. Hence, we can use existing algorithms to find the optimal safety stocks. We use a case study with real data to demonstrate that there are significant benefits from the inclusion of the forecast process when determining the optimal safety stocks. We also conduct a computational experiment to explore how the placement and size of the safety stocks depend on the nature of the forecast evolution process.

However, it may not be an easy task to determine the importance level of customers, especially when decisions need to be made under limited information. A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions. We consider such a service system where customers are from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider; however, each customer provides a signal, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each customer's signal equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of "good" signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized c mu rule perform well.

We consider two commonly used types of vessels-"liners" (ships whose routes are fixed in advance) and "trampers" (ships for which future route components are selected based on available shipping jobs)-and formulate a vessel profit maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces to the problem of minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a characterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where prices are constant through time and do not differ across ports and prices are constant through time and differ across ports. The structure of the optimal policy in such special cases yields insights on the complexity of the problem and also guides the construction of heuristics for the general problem setting.

Each class of service request is subject to a class-dependent quality of service (QoS) guarantee on the expected delay bound, which may be imposed by business rules in an organization or other application-specific technical constraints. We develop an extension of a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for an M/M/1 system. In contrast to the system without the QoS guarantee, where a fixed priority scheduling policy-known as the c mu rule-is optimal, we show that the system may need to adopt a more general randomized priority scheduling policy to maximize the overall system profit. We also develop a transfer pricing scheme that is both optimal and incentive compatible, allowing users to act in their self-interests while collectively achieving the system optimum. We show that the pricing scheme with the QoS guarantee depends on the scheduling policy implemented and has different characteristics from that without the QoS guarantee.

The main estimators considered are: (i) the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES), (ii) the delay experienced so far by the customer at the head of the line (HOL), and (iii) the delay experienced by the customer to have arrived most recently among those who have already completed service (RCS). We compare these delay-history estimators to the standard estimator based on the queue length (QL), commonly used in practice, which requires knowledge of the mean interval between successive service completions in addition to the QL. We characterize performance by the mean squared error (MSE). We do an analysis and conduct simulations for the standard GI/M/s multiserver queueing model, emphasizing the case of large s. We obtain analytical results for the conditional distribution of the delay given the observed HOL delay. An approximation to its mean value serves as a refined estimator. For all three candidate delay estimators, the MSE relative to the square of the mean is asymptotically negligible in the many-server and classical heavy-traffic (HT) limiting regimes.

The first is the partitioning of server capacity among different customers based on their service time requirements. The second is rush hour demand where a large number of customers arrive over a short period of time followed by few or no arrivals for an extended period thereafter. We study a system with multiple parallel servers and multiple customer classes. The servers can be partitioned into server groups, each dedicated to a single customer class. The system operates under a rush hour regime with a large number of customers arriving at the beginning of the rush hour period. We show that this allows us to reduce the problem to one that is deterministic and for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We compare the performance of the system with and without server partitioning during rush hour and address three basic questions. (1) Is partitioning beneficial to the system? (2) Is it equally beneficial to all customer classes? (3) If it is implemented, what is an optimal partition? We evaluate the applicability of our results to systems where customers arrive over time using (1) deterministic fluid models and (2) simulation models for systems with stochastic interarrival times.

Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that whereas psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved. We further investigate direct and indirect antecedents of psychological safety. This research offers insights into actions that managers can take to enhance psychological safety and, consequently, motivate their employees to share knowledge.

In a sole- sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier ( the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier ( the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer to take advantage of alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer is referred to as the option value of second sourcing. On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future pro. tin second sourcing induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in second sourcing than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of second sourcing. The overall benefit of second sourcing relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of second sourcing is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus second sourcing is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high ( under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that second sourcing is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that second sourcing may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity.

In this study we employ three competing theoretical frameworks signaling, efficiency gains, and institutional theory-to analyze the motivations for a firm to acquire quality certification and the performance implications thereafter. We test these hypotheses in the context of CMM certification based on data from the Indian offshore IT services industry between 1997 and 2002. Our results indicate that more cost-effective firms and export-oriented firms are more likely to seek out and acquire certification. In addition, CMM-certified firms show significant improvements in exports, but not on the firm's cost structure. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CMM certification helps indicate firm capabilities to potential customers and thus appear to be most consistent with signaling explanations of certification rather than the efficiency gains or institutional theories.

Yet the theory on the value of component commonality is rather limited in the inventory literature. The existing results were built primarily on single-period models or periodic-review models with zero lead times. In this paper, we consider a continuous-review system with positive lead times. We find that although component commonality is in general beneficial, its value depends strongly on component costs, lead times, and dynamic allocation rules. Under certain conditions, several previous findings based on static models do not hold. In particular, component commonality does not always generate inventory benefits under certain commonly used allocation rules. We provide insight on when component commonality generates inventory benefits and when it may not. We further establish some asymptotic properties that connect component lead times and costs to the impact of component commonality. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate the value of commonality and its sensitivity to various system parameters in between the asymptotic limits. In addition, we show how to evaluate the system under a new allocation rule, a modified version of the standard first-in-first-out rule.

The results are based on a sample of 276 excess inventory announcements made during 1990-2002. Over a two-day period (the day of the announcement and the day before the announcement) the mean ( median) stock market reaction ranges from -6.79% to -6.93% (-4.51% to -4.79%), depending on the benchmark used to estimate the market reaction. The percent of sample firms that experience negative market reaction ranges from 73% to 74%. When excess inventory is at the announcing firm's customers, the market reaction is more negative than when the excess inventory is at the announcing firm. The stock market reaction is less negative for excess inventory announcements made by larger firms but is more negative for firms with higher growth prospects and with higher debt-equity ratios.

Division of labor is viewed as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of production processes through specialization. At the same time, division of labor also introduces coordination cost as handoffs and communication needs increase. We attempt to empirically assess the net effect in primary care physician offices. We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types. We find evidence supporting both hypotheses. We conclude that many physicians are gaining little financial benefit from delegating work to support staff. This suggests that small practices with few staff may be viable alternatives to traditional practice designs.

We analyze the optimal solution-structure of a two-period lifetime problem and from insights gained in numerical experiments, develop a base-stock/list-price heuristic policy for products with arbitrary fixed lifetimes. Experiments show this policy to be effective.

A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of "supply learning" (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model.

The objective is to obtain a cyclic schedule-a sequence of robot moves and an ordering of the parts-that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. We consider two different models that are currently used in practice. The first is a single-gripper cell with a unit-capacity output buffer at each machine. The second is a bufferless dual-gripper cell. We focus our analysis on a widely used class of cyclic solutions, referred to as CRM cycles. The main outcome of our analysis is the equivalence of the two models (i.e., the maximum throughput is the same for both models) under conditions that are common in practice. The equivalence is established in two steps: (i) identification of a subset of dominating cyclic solutions for each model, and (ii) provision of a one-to-one mapping between these dominating cycles such that corresponding cycles have the same throughput. We also analyze the computational complexity of the throughput maximization problem for the two models. The enhanced capabilities (i. e., output buffers and dual gripper) of both models were motivated by a need to improve the throughput. However, the costs of acquiring these capabilities differ significantly. Our discussions with operations managers at a Dallas-area robotic cell manufacturer revealed that the total cost of designing and programming the robot's control mechanism for a cell with output buffers is about 20% less than that for a dual-gripper cell. The equivalence of the two models is, therefore, somewhat surprising and has significant practical implications. For cells that operationalize CRM cycles, the use of output buffers instead of a dual gripper can result in considerable savings without compromising throughput.

Components can be ordered early at normal prices before the demand is revealed, or they can be replenished later at higher prices due to expediting. In addition, the customer pays a price for the final product that is nonincreasing in the delivery lead time to discourage late delivery. We propose a cost-minimization model and develop an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve the problem.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-c mu (Gc mu) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.

Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.

First, it identifies configurations of ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies. Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.

The importance of this setting is twofold: From a practical point of view, there are several examples, both in manufacturing (e. g., auctioning the capacity of a wafer fabrication facility) and service industries (e. g., auctioning the sponsorship of a website), where a supplier's capacity is sold as a single piece; from a theoretical side, it highlights the information asymmetry introduced on the downstream supply chain parties when the auction result is disclosed. We formulate the problem as a two-stage supply chain comprising a single supplier and two resellers. Each reseller receives a signal of the consumer demand and bids for the capacity of the supplier. The supplier announces the winner as well as the auction price. Both resellers can get additional units in a procurement market and then engage in Cournot competition in the consumer market. We analyze the impact of the information elicited by the supplier in the early stage of the game. We characterize sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium behavior, derive the equilibrium bidding functions under both first -and second-price auctions, and show that the bidding functions are lower than the corresponding ones for a single-shot auction without resale. Our computational experiments indicate that both the supplier and resellers are better off running a second-price auction and that consumers benefit if the resellers have very different signals on the total demand. Overall, our results suggest that traditional auctions may have a profound impact in the context of a supply chain because of the information disclosure in the upstream stages.

Within a multinomial logit model of consumer choice over substitutes, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming formulation and derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy. We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season. Based on the above insights, we propose a computationally efficient approach to the initial inventory decision, which delivers close-to-optimal inventory levels for all testing cases.

However, this assignment is necessarily myopic because it cannot account for any subsequent customer orders or future inventory replenishment. We examine the benefits of periodically reevaluating these real-time assignments. We construct near-optimal heuristics for the reassignment for a large set of customer orders to minimize the total number of shipments. Finally, we present evidence of significant saving opportunities by testing the heuristics on order data from a major online retailer.

Backlogging is allowed, unlike as in related previous work, and inventory cost is interpreted as backlogging cost when inventory is negative. We create finite horizon truncations of the infinite horizon problem and employ classic results on convex production planning to derive a closed-form formula for the minimum forecast horizon. We show that optimal production levels are monotonically increasing in the length of horizon, leading to solution convergence and a rolling horizon procedure for delivering an infinite horizon optimal production plan. The minimum forecast horizon formula is employed to illustrate how cost parameters affect how far one must look into the future to make an infinite horizon optimal decision today.

We use the capacity estimate to find a contact center's optimal daily staffing levels. The implementation results, from an actual contact center, demonstrate that the method provides accurate staffing recommendations. We also examine and test models in which agents exhibit speed-up behavior and in which capacity varies over time. Finally, we use the capacity estimates to examine the implications of solving the staffing problem with two different model formulations, the service-level constraint formulation used by the contact center and an alternate profit-maximization formulation.

The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort.

Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers' valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers' perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the seller's and the consumers' payoffs is possible. Finally, we find that the ability to credibly commit to a fixed price path is not very valuable when the seller can implement price matching.

Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.

Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem. Our main managerial insight is that there is a significant benefit even if pricing and scheduling are only heuristically or partially coordinated. Moreover, heuristic and partial coordination are simple to achieve.

In such a channel, several competitive forces interact with one another to affect the price and quantity decisions of the firms involved. These include: (1) the direct competition each supplier faces for producing the same component, (2) the indirect competition among the suppliers producing the set of complementary components needed for assembling the final product, and (3) the vertical interaction between the assembler and the component suppliers. This paper shows that the direct competition that one supplier faces helps improve the performance of the assembler and all the other suppliers in the channel; and surprisingly, it can help improve the performance of this particular supplier facing the competition as well. Second, the assembler benefits from a merger of suppliers producing different components in the complementary set. Furthermore, the assembler prefers a merger of suppliers with less direct competition over a merger of suppliers with more direct competition.

The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).

The costs of placing an order and using each freight mode consist of fixed components and hence exhibit economies of scale. We derive an optimal policy for using the two freight modes for shipping each order. This freight-mode decision is delayed until manufacturing is complete and the optimal policy uses information about the demand incurred in the meantime. Furthermore, given that the two freight modes are used optimally for shipping each order, we solve our model for reorder point and order quantity that minimizes cost. We analyze the cost savings achieved from postponing the freight-mode decision and provide analytical and numerical comparisons between the solutions to our two-freight model and single-freight models. Finally, we illustrate the properties of the solution to our model using an extensive set of numerical examples.

We develop conditions under which the leader (she) can take strategic advantage of her limited capacity by pricing relatively low, purposefully creating shortages and leaving some leftovers for the follower (him) to feast on, avoiding direct competition. The extent to which the leader benefits in this Leftovers Equilibrium depends on operational variables such as the capacity levels of the two firms and the sequence in which customers arrive at the market. We spell out the details for three different known arrival sequences within a specific subset of plausible fixed-capacity levels. The follower's strategic shadow price can be positive even when not all his capacity is used, and the leader's can be negative when all her capacity is used. We illustrate that Leftovers Equilibria can arise when some of our assumptions are relaxed.

Unlike statisticians, managers are typically more interested in the performance of a decision rather than the statistical validity of the underlying model. We propose a framework and a statistical test that incorporate decision performance into a measure of statistical validity. Under general conditions on the objective function, asymptotic behavior of our test admits a sharp and simple characterization. We develop our approach in a revenue management setting and apply the test to a data set used to optimize prices for consumer loans. We show that traditional model-based goodness-of-fit tests may consistently reject simple parametric models of consumer response (e. g., the ubiquitous logit model), while at the same time these models may "pass" the proposed performance-based test. Such situations arise when decisions derived from a postulated (and possibly incorrect) model generate results that cannot be distinguished statistically from the best achievable performance-i.e., when demand relationships are fully known.

Although suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory to meet total needs across all production sites, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit, and also transfer on-hand inventory in order to balance supply across sites. This paper describes the development, implementation, and impact of the process and optimization-based control system now used by Dell to address this supply-routing challenge for its U. S.-bound monitors. In a first phase, Dell created a new job definition focused solely on supply routing and implemented a supporting visualization tool. In a second phase, a decision support system relying on a mixed-integer programming formulation was implemented, overcoming two main challenges: (i) the estimation of shortages as a function of expected inventory, accounting for actual forecast quality; and (ii) the estimation of a meaningful shortage cost. This new methodology is estimated to have reduced Dell's inventory-repositioning costs for monitors by about 60%.

Less well understood is the tradeoff between the increased ability to precisely meet customer preferences and the increased leadtime from order placement to delivery often associated with customized products. In this paper, we use a locational customer choice model to formulate a firm's integrated product line design problem that involves variety, leadtime (or inventory), and pricing decisions. We propose a dynamic programming based solution procedure that amounts to solving a shortest path problem on an acyclic network, and derive some structural results on the optimal product line de sign. We find that unimodal preferences generally result in hybrid product lines, with standard products clustering around the mode and custom products covering the tails, in contrast with the all-custom or all-standard product lines that are optimal under uniform preferences. We also numerically examine how the firm should adjust its leadtime and variety in response to changes in parameters such as customer dispersion and operational scale. We find that the tradeoff between leadtime and variety is sometimes nonintuitive and complex.

Even large suppliers (e. g., Delphi) could file for bankruptcy, and manufacturers' actions, such as financial subsidies to suppliers, profoundly affect suppliers' financial health. Using a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model of the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidy decisions and a general firm-value model of the supplier's financial state, this paper addresses the following questions: What is the optimal joint capacity ordering and financial subsidy policy for the manufacturer? Must subsidy and capacity ordering decisions be made jointly? How good are the recommendations from the traditional procurement models, which ignore the benefits of controlling the supplier's financial state through subsidies? The paper presents general assumptions that allow the manufacturer to make ordering decisions independent of subsidy decisions and investigates interactions between ordering and subsidy decisions when these assumptions are violated. Conditions are presented for the optimal subsidy policy to have a "subsidize-up-to" structure and for the optimal ordering decisions to be newsvendor fractiles.

The buyer procures a product from a supplier and then sells to the marketplace. Market demand is stochastic and depends on the buyer's selling price. The supplier's production cost is private information, and the buyer only knows the distribution of the cost. Both the buyer and the supplier can hold inventories to improve service, and a periodic-review inventory system is considered. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement mechanism: quantity attribute (i.e., the total purchase quantity) and service-level attribute (i.e., the supplier's delivery performance). We first identify the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer, which consists of a nonlinear menu of contracts for each of the two attributes. It can be shown that the optimal mechanism induces both a lower market demand and a lower service level compared to the supply chain optimum. In view of the complexity of the optimal mechanism, we proceed to search for simpler mechanisms that perform well for the buyer. We find that the above two attributes have different implications for procurement mechanism design: The value of using complex contract terms is generally negligible for the service-level attribute, whereas it can be highly valuable for the quantity attribute. In particular, we demonstrate that a fixed service-level contract, which consists of a target service level and a price-quantity menu, yields nearly optimal profit for the buyer. Additionally, the price-quantity menu is essentially a quantity discount scheme widely observed in practice.

Order Release Policies for Warehouses with an Automated Sorter	WOS:000283055000006	inventory theory and control; production planning and scheduling; dynamic programming; queueing theory; simulation	PICKING; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	4	Batch (wave) release policies are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms depending on how batches released consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U. S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy with the goal of maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners.

Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we provide certain general conditions on the demand and cost processes under which a myopic policy is optimal. Under these conditions, the optimal policy is a myopic state-dependent base-stock policy, which can be expressed in closed form as a base-probability policy. Specifically, the order associated with a given customer should be placed if and only if its arrival probability within the leadtime is higher than a threshold. Our results generalize earlier conditions for the optimality of myopic policies. Namely, we show that myopic policies can be optimal even when the demand is correlated or stochastically decreasing.

WOS:000283055000008	newsvendor model; task context; heuristics; random choice	FEEDBACK; MODELS	4	Previous experimental work showed that newsvendors tend to order closer to mean demand than prescribed by the normative critical fractile solution. A recently proposed explanation for this mean ordering behavior assumes that the decision maker commits random choice errors, and predicts the mean ordering pattern because there is more room to err toward mean demand than away from it. Do newsvendors exhibit mean ordering simply because they make random errors? We subject this hypothesis to an empirical test that rests on the fact that the random error explanation is insensitive to context. Our results strongly support the existence of context-sensitive decision strategies that rely directly on (biased) order-to-demand mappings, such as mean demand anchoring, demand chasing, and inventory error minimization.

We first show that the problem is polynomially solvable and then develop several insights into the behavior of such systems and identify strategies for effectively managing them. A key driver for the extent of substitution is the ratio of changeover cost to the substitution cost associated with mean demand. The interaction between changeovers and substitution is most prominent when this ratio is neither too high nor too low. Furthermore, the value of this ratio also influences the length of an appropriate rolling horizon; an increase in the value of the ratio signals an increase in the length of a near-optimal rolling horizon. We identify a complementary relationship between substitution and changeover costs: When the changeover cost is large, it is better to invest in reducing the substitution cost and vice versa. As the holding cost of the substitutable product increases, substitution is (respectively, changeovers are) utilized more when the changeover (respectively, substitution) cost is large.

However, there are recent cases in which the manufacturer imposes "delayed payment" contracts under which each supplier is paid only when all suppliers have completed their tasks. By considering a model of one manufacturer and n >= 2 identical and independent suppliers with exponential completion times, we analyze the impact of both a delayed payment regime and a no-delayed-payment regime on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's net profit in equilibrium. When the suppliers' work rates are unadjustable, we conjecture that the manufacturer is actually worse off under the delayed payment regime. However, when the suppliers' work rates are adjustable, we obtain a different result: the delayed payment regime is more profitable for the manufacturer either when the project revenue is sufficiently small or when the number of suppliers is sufficiently large.

They are also good at modeling demand for unrestricted fare class structures, which are widespread throughout the industry. However, there is little empirical research on the practicality and effectiveness of choice-based RM models. Toward this end, we report the results of a study of choice-based RM conducted with a major U. S. airline. Our study had two main objectives: (1) to assess the extent to which choice models can be estimated well using readily available airline data, and (2) to gauge the potential impact that choice-based RM could have on a sample of test markets. We developed a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that uses a variation of the expectation-maximization method to account for unobservable data. The procedure was applied to data for a test market from New York City to a destination in Florida. The outputs are promising in terms of the quality of the computed estimates, although a large number of departure instances may be necessary to achieve highly accurate results. These choice model estimates were then used in a simulation study to assess the revenue performance of the EMSR-b (expected marginal seat revenue, version b) capacity control policies and the current controls used by the airline relative to controls optimized to account for choice behavior. Our simulation results show 1%-5% average revenue improvements using choice-based RM. Although such simulated results must be taken with caution, overall our study suggests that choice-based revenue management is both feasible to execute and economically significant in real-world airline environments.

The pricing of their capacity is an important problem in practice for pipeline companies and the users of this capacity, which include shippers such as natural gas merchants, producers, and local distribution companies. This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it. This analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the evolution of natural gas prices is an important driver of operational performance in the pricing of pipeline capacity. The results of this paper have potential relevance for the pricing of the capacity of other commodity conversion assets.

For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitor's inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics. We confirm that quick response is more beneficial when demand uncertainty is higher or exhibits a higher correlation over time. We also find that the competitive advantage from quick response is larger when facing a slow response competitor, and interestingly, asymmetric competition can be desirable to both competitors.

This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency.

In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the notion of epsilon-Nash equilibrium and apply it to the study of equilibria in a market with multiple large-scale service providers that compete on both prices and response times. In an analogy to fluid and diffusion approximations for queueing systems, we introduce the notions of fluid game and diffusion game. The proposed framework allows us to provide first-order and second-order characterization results for the equilibria in these markets. We use our results to provide insights into the price and service-level choices in the market and, in particular, into the impact of market scale on the interdependence between these two strategic decisions.

The following questions are addressed: How many customer-service representatives are required (staffing), and when should cross-selling opportunities be exercised (control) in a way that will maximize the expected profit of the center while maintaining a prespecified service level target? We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another. We show that our joint staffing and control scheme is nearly optimal for large systems. Furthermore, it performs extremely well, even for relatively small systems.

A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand.

We are interested in analyzing the scale economies inherent in such a system. In particular, we study how the firm's pricing and capacity decisions change as the scale, measured by the potential market for the service, increases. These decisions turn out to depend intricately on the form of the delay costs seen by the customers; we characterize these decisions up to the dominant order in the scale for both convex and concave delay costs. We show that when serving customers on a first-come, first-served basis, if the customers' delay costs are strictly convex, the firm can increase its utilization and extract profits beyond what it can do when customers' delay costs are linear. However, with concave delay costs, the firm is forced to decrease its utilization and makes less profit than in the linear case. While studying concave delay costs, we demonstrate that these decisions depend on the scheduling policy employed as well. We show that employing the last-come, first-served rule in the concave case results in utilization and profit similar to the linear case, regardless of the actual form of the delay costs.

This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers' incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price. We also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium, e. g., sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes, the cost effect due to alliance formation (either cost savings or additional costs), and a system without an assembler.

We develop stylized optimization models of airtime capacity planning and allocation across multiple clients under audience uncertainty. In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season. Our results suggest that broadcasting companies should prioritize upfront clients according to marginal revenue per audience unit. We find that accepted upfront market contracts can be aggregated across clients and served in proportion to the audience demanded. Closed-form solutions are obtained in a static setting. These results remain valid in a dynamic setting, when considering the opportunity to increase allocation by airing make-goods during the broadcasting season. Our structural results characterize the impact of contracting parameters, time, and audience uncertainty on profits and capacity decisions. The results hold under general audience and spot market profit models. Overall, we find that ignoring audience uncertainty can have a significant cost for media capacity planning and allocation.

Under the additive delay cost structure, service providers offer different prices and expected delays, but customers are indifferent between the providers. Under the generalized delay cost structure, when the providers have different capacity or operating costs, we obtain value-based market segmentation, whereby higher-value customers choose one provider and lower-value customers choose the other. We study how the delay cost parameters, the market size, and the service providers' costs affect the structure of the equilibrium.

Knowing these costs, manufacturers book available production days in a first-come-first-serve order to optimize their individual cost. The cost for each manufacturer consists of booking and work-in-progress costs, as expressed by the weighted flow time. When window booking is completed, the third party identifies a schedule that minimizes the total cost incurred by all manufacturers. This coordination reduces the total cost but may result in higher costs for a subset of manufacturers. For this reason, the third party devises a savings sharing scheme with which the monetary benefit for each manufacturer is greater. In this article we present algorithms for the problem considered, as well as savings-sharing schemes that make coordination a better alternative for all parties. The highlight of our experiments is that the costs of the production chain can be reduced by an average of 32% if one-third of the members let the third party cover their increased work-in-progress cost in exchange for 38%-53% of the total savings.

Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.

Although the firm has to invest in capital-intensive production facilities and produce outputs in the face of demand and exchange rate uncertainties, it can postpone the transshipment, localization, and distribution of the output until after uncertainties are resolved. The key network design decisions faced by the firm are in which of the two markets to locate the capital-intensive production facilities and what the corresponding output levels should be. We provide the complete characterization of the optimal global facility network configuration for two types of global firms: a newsvendor with exogenously given selling prices and a firm with the. exibility of pricing responsively after uncertainties are resolved. Our study's focus is on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty and responsive pricing on facility network decisions. Compared with a newsvendor facing demand uncertainty only, the introduction of exchange rate uncertainty or the use of responsive pricing can increase the attractiveness of centralized production. A responsive-pricing firm's optimal network design differs from that of a newsvendor firm as follows. (1) The firm's network preference is less susceptible to the increase of localization costs. (2) The firm is less likely to switch from a network of regional production to a network of centralized production in response to the increasing size of one market. (3) Demand and exchange rate uncertainties can have opposite effects on its optimal centralized output when the nature of the random shocks they introduce to the firm's demand function is different: under the linear demand function, the optimal centralized output increases in the demand volatility when demand shock is additive, but it may decrease in the exchange rate volatility because the corresponding price shock is multiplicative. Interestingly, common to both types of firms, their network preferences, although sensitive to costs and mean demand and exchange rate, are robust to the demand and exchange rate volatilities, suggesting that transshipment-enabled output substitutability between the two markets diminishes the impact of increasing market volatilities on the network design decision.

Before the demand is realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged at the end of the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit-transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs)-that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among "more asymmetric" retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are "more alike," but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e. g., high critical fractiles or lower demand variances).

For a good that has two periods of lifetime, we build a model that generalizes and/or subsumes many of the models in the literature and study the effectiveness of two intuitive heuristic (base-stock) replenishment policies combined with different substitution rules. For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the inventory of aged items, ordering a constant amount each period. Thus the benefit of pooling inventory for substitutable, perishable products depends critically on the replenishment policy used.

Under traditional scheduling, each of a specified number of patients per day is booked well in advance, but may not show up for his or her appointment. Under open-access scheduling, a random number of patients call in the morning to make an appointment for that same day. Thus the number of patient arrivals will be random, for different reasons, under both policies. We find that the open-access schedule will significantly outperform the traditional schedule-in terms of a weighted average of patients' waiting time, the doctor's idle time, and the doctor's overtime-except when patient waiting time is held in little regard or when the probability of no-shows is quite small.

In a simulation study that considers a model clinic, which is created using data obtained from an actual clinic, we find that the heuristics proposed outperform all the other benchmark policies, particularly when the patient load is high compared with the regular capacity. Supporting earlier findings in the literature, we find that the open access policy, a recently proposed popular scheduling paradigm that calls for "meeting today's demand today," can be a reasonable choice when the patient load is relatively low.

Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing remanufacturing disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant. When manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are different, we develop a heuristic method for computing the near-optimal control policy that performs quite well as demonstrated numerically.

We propose a simultaneous dynamic programming approach to solve the resulting problem, which is a nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. We show that our approximation leads to a tighter upper bound on optimal expected revenue than some known bounds in the literature. Our approach can be viewed as a variant of the classical dynamic programming decomposition widely used in the research and practice of network RM. The computational cost of this new decomposition approach is only slightly higher than the classical version. A numerical study shows that heuristic control policies from the decomposition consistently outperform policies from the classical decomposition.

An important factor in both is the inherent economies of scale. Therefore, we advance a unifying model covering both applications and study the associated contracting problem under information asymmetry. At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, "the originator," faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution. Hence, it is optimal among all possible contracts (in both settings) because of economies of scale and contractibility of realized demand.

At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed-one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable demand signal.

The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates the existence of a monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one.

The success of such programs depends on well-designed and executed trade-in policies as well as accurate prediction of return flow to support operational decisions. Motivated by a real problem facing a high-tech company, this paper develops methods to segment customers and forecast product returns based on return merchandise authorization information. Noisy, yet proven to be valuable, returned quantity signals are adjusted by taking product characteristics and customer heterogeneity into account, and the resulting forecast outperforms two benchmark strategies that represent the high-tech company's current practice and a widely adopted method in the literature, respectively. In addition, our methods can serve as tools for companies to uncover the root causes of return merchandise authorization discrepancy, monitor and analyze customer behavior, design segment-specific trade-in policies, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of trade-in programs on a continuous basis.

Over the past years, retailers have increasingly relied on their leading manufacturers for recommendations regarding the assortment to be offered to the consumers in a particular category, a practice often referred to as category captainship. Our research investigates the consequences of using category captains for assortment selection decisions. We develop a game-theoretic model where multiple manufacturers sell their products to consumers through a single retailer. We compare a model where the retailer selects the assortment in the category with a model where the retailer relies on a category captain for assortment decisions in return for a target category profit. We show that category captainship can, in some circumstances, benefit not only the retailer and the category captain, but also the noncaptain manufacturers. Our results have implications regarding the implementation of category captainship practices.

Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.

In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity-output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers.

Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems. These features make it an interesting candidate to be pursued for real-world applications.

For funders there is an increasing and pressing need to ensure that society reaps the most social benefit for their money while also developing the nonprofit sector as a whole. By routinely scrutinizing nonprofit reports in an effort to deduce whether a nonprofit organization is efficient, funders may believe that they are, in fact, giving responsibly. However, we find that these nonprofit reports are unreliable, supporting a myriad of empirical research and revealing that report-based funding methods do not facilitate efficient allocation of funds. In response, we develop audit contracts that put funders in a position to enact change. Auditing, perhaps obviously, supports funders; however, we find that it also benefits the population of nonprofits. Moreover, auditing results in improved efficiency for the nonprofit sector overall. Indeed, our conclusions indicate that nonprofits may want to work with funders to increase the use of auditing, consequently increasing efficiency for the sector overall and impacting society as a whole.

The objective of this paper is to conduct an empirical study of an important industry to measure to what extent waiting time performance impacts different firms' market shares and price decisions. We report on a large-scale empirical industrial organization study in which the demand equations for fast-food drive-thru restaurants in Cook County are estimated based on so-called structural estimation methods. Our results confirm the belief expressed by industry experts, that in the fast-food drive-thru industry customers trade off price and waiting time. More interestingly, our estimates indicate that consumers attribute a very high cost to the time they spend waiting.

These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of cross shipping, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to-and withdrawal of fit cash from-the Fed; and (ii) offering a custodial inventory program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models-designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI-that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed-based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider-helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the Value of Local Reuse for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.

A Bayesian scheme is employed to dynamically update the demand distribution for the problem with storable or perishable inventory and with exogenous or endogenous price. We show that the Weibull is the only newsvendor distribution for which the optimal solution can be expressed in scalable form. Moreover, for Weibull demand the cost function is not convex in general. Nevertheless, in all but the storable case, sufficient structure can be discerned so that the optimal solution can be easily computed. Specifically, for the perishable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found by solving simple recursions, whereas the perishable case with pricing requires solutions to more complex one-step look-ahead recursions. Interestingly, for the special case of exponential demand the cost function is convex, so that for the storable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found using simple one-step look-ahead recursions whereas for the perishable case the optimal policy can be expressed by exact closed-form formulas.

We study how informing customers about their anticipated delays affects performance. Customers react by balking upon hearing the delay announcement and may subsequently renege, particularly if the realized waiting time exceeds the delay that has originally been announced to them. The balking and reneging from such a system are a function of the delay announcement. Modeling the call center as an M/M/s+M queue with endogenized customer reactions to announcements, we analytically characterize performance measures for this model. The analysis allows us to explore the role announcing different percentiles of the waiting time distribution, i.e., announcement coverage, plays on subsequent performance in terms of balking and reneging. Through a numerical study, we explore when informing customers about delays is beneficial and what the optimal coverage should be in these announcements. We show how managers of a call center with delay announcements can control the trade-off between balking and reneging through their choice of announcements to be made.

We study the optimal decisions for both a price-taking and a price-setting newsvendor when the advertiser has private information about its willingness to pay for advertisements. We find that the newsvendor's optimal policy excludes advertisers with low willingness to pay and distorts the price and quantity from its system-efficient level to screen the advertiser. Our analysis reveals the different roles that pricing and production quantity play as screening instruments.

In this paper, we consider a repeated newsvendor setting where this is not the case and study the problem of setting inventory targets when there is a limited amount of historical demand data. Consequently, we achieve the following objectives: (1) to quantify the inaccuracy in the inventory-target estimation as a function of the length of the historical demand data, the critical fractile, and the shape parameters of the demand distribution; and (2) to determine the inventory target that minimizes the expected cost and accounts for the uncertainty around the demand parameters estimated from limited historical data. We achieve these objectives by using the concept of expected total operating cost and representing the demand distribution with the highly flexible Johnson translation system. Our procedures require no restrictive assumptions about the first four moments of the demand random variables, and they can be easily implemented in practical settings with reduced expected total operating costs.

We study the effects of diversity in experience on a team's ability to respond to task changes by separately examining interpersonal team diversity (i.e., differences in experience across the entire team) and intrapersonal team diversity (i.e., whether individuals on the team are more or less specialized). We also examine whether team familiarity-team members' prior experience working with one another-helps teams to better manage challenges created by task changes and greater interpersonal team diversity. Using detailed project-and individual-level data from an Indian software services firm, we find that the interaction of task change with intrapersonal diversity is related to improved project performance, whereas the interaction of task change with interpersonal diversity is related to diminished performance. Additionally, the interaction of team familiarity with interpersonal diversity is related to improved project performance in some cases. Our results highlight a need for more nuanced approaches to leveraging experience in team management.

Consumers observe an imperfect private signal indicating which service facility may provide better service value as well as the queue lengths at the service facilities before making their choice. If more consumers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at that facility and indicate higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time. We characterize the equilibrium queue-joining behavior of arriving consumers and the extent of their learning from the queue information in the presence of such positive and negative externalities. We find that when the arrival rates are low, utility-maximizing rational consumers herd and join the longer queue, ignoring any contrary private information. We show that even when consumers treat queues as independently evolving, herd behavior persists with consumers joining longer queues above a threshold queue difference. However, if the consumers seek to minimize ex post regret when making their decisions, herd behavior may be dampened.

S. health insurance firm to examine how product customization affects the firm's cost to serve customers through its call center. In our setting, the product is a complex health insurance plan. The firm incurs substantial costs in serving the customers through its call center and in adjudicating the claims using its information systems. The firm sells either standard plans or in some instances allows customer groups to customize their plans by adding and modifying certain aspects in active collaboration with the firm. Such a collaboration process is akin to the firm cocreating products with its customers. This cocreation process should increase customers' familiarity with their coverage and improve the fit with their medical needs. Better fit and familiarity in turn, reduces customers' incentives to contact the call center for clarifications regarding the firm's product coverage. In particular, we show that customers with a customized plan call 21% less frequently than customers with a standard plan. Our results account for possible self-selection of customers to customized plans. We also show no difference in the claims adjudication cost between a standard and a customized plan exists. Overall, our results suggest customized plans may be operationally cheaper to serve than standard plans. Thus, our paper provides a link between a growing business concern (customer support cost via call centers) and a prevalent business strategy (product customization via cocreation).

A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a "chain store") and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store.

For medical conditions requiring urgent attention, patients want quick access to a familiar physician. For such instances, it is important for clinics to have open slots that allow same-day (urgent) access. A major challenge when designing outpatient appointment systems is the difficulty of matching randomly arriving patients' booking requests with physicians' available slots in a manner that maximizes patients' satisfaction as well as clinics' revenues. What makes this problem difficult is that booking preferences are not tracked, may differ from one patient to another, and may change over time. This paper describes a framework for the design of the next generation of appointment systems that dynamically learn and update patients' preferences and use this information to improve booking decisions. Analytical results leading to a partial characterization of an optimal booking policy are presented. Examples show that heuristic decision rules, based on this characterization, perform well and reveal insights about trade-offs among a variety of performance metrics important to clinic managers.

Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation of the quality level. Customers make product choices to maximize a linear utility function of price, quality level, and waiting cost. Resulting product demands are met through capacity investments in production processes, which are modeled as queuing systems. We consider two different types of production processes: product-focused, dedicated to the production of a single-product variant; and product-flexible, processing all product variants in the product line. Capacity investment and variable production costs are functions of the processed product's quality. We develop an integrated marketing-operations model that provides insights on the factors determining the right level of product variety to offer, the relative quality positioning of the products in the line, the resulting market coverage and segmentation, and the effects on production costs and congestion levels of the processes. We show that the statistical economies of scale resulting from the congestion phenomena in the production system impose limits on the optimal product variety. For product-focused processes the market size promotes a higher optimal product variety, whereas the per-unit capacity investment and customer waiting costs act as deterrents for higher product variety. For product-flexible processes optimal product variety also depends on the specific type of flexibility and the ratio of capacity investment to variable production costs.

The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion.

Suppose each of several retailers observes local demand for a common item and places an order at the supplier, which is immediately filled if the supplier has the item in stock. The supplier can fill retailer orders either from their reserved inventories or from a shareable pool of inventory. Using terminology from cooperative game theory, we say that the supplier and the retailers whose orders are filled from the common pool have formed an inventory-pooling coalition and study the use of Shapley value to allocate the expected excess profit because of pooling. We find that under Shapley value allocations the retailers have incentive to join the inventory-pooling coalition, and the supplier carries the level of inventory that is optimal for the coalition. Shapley value allocations might not lie within the core of the game, but the grand coalition of all players is stable in the farsighted sense. And, although the supplier's share of the expected excess profit is largest when all the retailers participate in the inventory-pooling coalition, the allocations to the retailers may diminish as the coalition grows. Colluding against the supplier (by merging and forming larger retailers) may seem like an appealing strategy for the retailers to increase their share of the total supply chain profit, but we find that the total expected after-pooling profits of retailers may instead go down because of collusion.

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply chain structures that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i.e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may have a significant impact on the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply chain structures are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment.

We discover that the value of volume flexibility is a function of demand correlation between products, an outcome that cannot be explained by classical risk-pooling arguments. Furthermore, whereas the value of product flexibility always decreases in demand correlation, we show that the value of volume flexibility can increase or decrease in demand correlation depending on whether the products are strategic complements or substitutes. We further find that volume flexibility better combats aggregate demand uncertainty for the two products, whereas product flexibility is better at mitigating individual demand uncertainty for each product. Our results thus underscore the necessity of analyzing volume flexibility with more than one product and emphasize the contrast with product flexibility. Furthermore, we highlight the possible pitfalls of combining flexibilities: we show that although adding volume flexibility to product flexibility never hurts performance, adding product flexibility to volume flexibility is not always beneficial, even when such an addition is costless.

We derive optimal static overbooking levels and booking limits, in closed form, that minimize the maximum relative regret (i.e., maximize competitive ratio). We prove that the optimal booking limits are nested. Our work addresses a number of important issues. (i) We use partial information, which is critical because of the difficulty in forecasting fare-class demand. Demand and no-shows are characterized using interval uncertainty in our model. (ii) We make joint overbooking and fare-class allocation decisions. (iii) We obtain conservative but practical overbooking levels that improve the service quality without sacrificing profits. Using computational experiments, we benchmark our methods to existing ones and show that our model leads to effective, consistent, and robust decisions.

A unique characteristic of this problem is the return process of rented movies. We formulate this problem for new movies as a newsvendor-like problem with multiple rental opportunities for each copy. We provide demand and return forecasts at the store-day level based on comparable movies. We estimate the parameters of various demand and return models using an iterative maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Test results on data from a large movie rental firm reveal systematic underbuying of movies purchased through revenue-sharing contracts and overbuying of movies purchased through standard ( nonrevenue-sharing) ones. For the movies considered, our model estimates an increase in the average profit per title for new movies by 15.5% and 2.5% for revenue sharing and standard titles, respectively. We discuss the implications of revenue sharing on the profitability of the rental firm.

We consider a buyer facing multiple potential suppliers, each having an associated (exogenous) reliability that quantifies its risk of supply failure. We design optimal mechanisms that depend on the buyer's level of information regarding the suppliers' cost of production and reliability. When supplier reliability is known, we find that the optimal allocation resembles the allocation under full information, but with inflated production costs. When it is unknown, the same result is true when cost and reliability of a supplier are independent. Furthermore, the buyer does not have to pay any rent for information on suppliers' reliability. Moreover, we assess the benefits of the optimal mechanism compared to traditional auctions that ignore supply risk.

WOS:000290471900007	service operations; operations strategy; pricing and revenue management; game theory; queueing theory	CLUBS; QUEUE	2	Should a firm charge on a per-use basis or sell subscriptions when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion-raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e. g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e. g., some know they are "heavy" users and others know they are "light" users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service.

Products are assembled using a combination of common and dedicated components. We characterize the optimal assortment and derive the optimal inventory levels for the common and dedicated components under various bill-of-material configurations. We investigate the effect of commonality on product variety and compare its benefits under different demand characteristics. Commonality always leads to increased profits, but its effect on the level of product variety depends on the type of commonality. If all common components are used for the production of the entire set of products, then the optimal variety level increases relative to the system with no commonality. However, if the common components are used by a subset of the final products, then the optimal variety level may decrease with commonality. We find that the effects of commonality on profit and variety level are stronger under a demand model in which product demands are more variable and exhibit pairwise negative correlation relative to a model with independent demands.

The supply chain we study consists of a profit-maximizing manufacturer with a quantity-discount schedule that is nonincreasing in quantity and ensures nondecreasing revenue, a profit-maximizing GPO, a competitive source selling at a fixed unit price, and n providers (e.g., hospitals) with fixed demands for a single product. Each provider seeks to minimize its total purchasing cost (i.e., the cost of the goods plus the provider's own fixed transaction cost). Buying through the GPO offers providers possible cost reductions but may involve a membership fee. Selling through the GPO offers the manufacturer possibly higher volumes, but requires that the manufacturer pay the GPO a contract administration fee (CAF), i.e., a percentage of all revenue contracted through it. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine questions about this supply chain, including how the presence of a GPO affects the providers' total purchasing costs. We also address the controversy about whether Congress should amend the Social Security Act, which, under current law, permits CAFs. Among other things, we conclude that although CAFs affect the distribution of profits between manufacturers and GPOs, they do not affect the providers' total purchasing costs.

When orders from the retailers exceed the supplier's capacity, she must employ an allocation mechanism to balance supply and demand. In particular, we consider a commonly used allocation scheme in the automobile industry: turn-and-earn, which uses past sales to allocate capacity. In essence, retailers "earn" an allotment of a vehicle after they sell one. In contrast to turn-and-earn, fixed allocation ignores past sales and gives each retailer an equal share of the capacity. Earlier work has demonstrated that turn-and-earn induces more sales in a two-period setting compared to fixed allocation. The question remains unanswered whether turn-and-earn induces similar behaviors over a long horizon when retailers possess private demand information. We construct a dynamic stochastic game of order competition over an infinite horizon to track the order dynamics of the supply chain. We obtain a richer set of equilibrium behaviors than existing models predict. Instead of a symmetric allocation outcome, we observe that sales leadership may arise in equilibrium and that retailers with different past sales adopt distinct ordering strategies to respond to demand uncertainty. Transient sales dynamics suggest that sales leadership may not be persistent and can be eliminated by the occurrence of extremely low demand. This provides a theoretical explanation for several behavioral observations of some U.S. automobile dealers. In addition to the sales-inducing effect, interestingly, turn-and-earn also causes the retailers to absorb local demand variability.

First, we demonstrate that the previously established joint convexity of the long-run average cost is false. Hence, the optimization is not straightforward. We then point out that the joint convexity concept depends on whether S and T are continuous or discrete variables, and in some situations it may not even be well defined. Nonetheless, we are able to identify several useful properties of the cost function, such as submodularity and coordinatewise convexity. Based on these properties, we develop efficient algorithms to compute the optimal policy for continuous and discrete demands.

We find that the length of stay for patients admitted to the ICU is influenced by the occupancy level of the ICU. In particular, a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. Such "bounce-backs" have implications for the overall ICU effective capacity an early discharge immediately frees up capacity, but at the risk of a (potentially much higher) capacity requirement when the patient needs to be readmitted. We analyze these capacity implications, shedding light on the question of whether an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy or if it should follow the old quality slogan and "do it right the first time." By comparing the total capacity usage for patients who were discharged early versus those who were not, we show that an aggressive discharge policy applied to patients with lower clinical severity levels frees up capacity in the ICU. However, we find that an increased number of readmissions of patients with high clinical severity levels occur when the ICU is capacity constrained, thereby effectively reducing peak bed capacity.

We consider a two-stage supply chain with a single supplier selling its product to consumers through a single retailer. We assume that both the supplier and the retailer can improve the quality of their demand forecasts by making costly forecasting investments to gather and analyze information. First, we consider a noncollaborative model where the supplier and the retailer can invest in forecasting but do not share forecast information. Next, we examine a collaborative forecasting model where the supplier and the retailer combine their information to form a single shared demand forecast. We investigate the value of CF by comparing each party's profits in these scenarios under three contractual forms that are widely used in practice (two variations of the simple wholesale price contract as well as the buyback contract). We show that for a given set of parameters, CF may be Pareto improving for none to all three of the contractual structures, and that the Pareto regions under all three contractual structures can be expressed with a unifying expression that admits an intuitive interpretation. We observe that these regions are limited and explain how they are shaped by the contractual structure, power balance, and relative forecasting capability of the parties. To determine the specific value of collaborative forecasting as a function of different factors, we carry out a numerical analysis and observe the following. First, under noncoordinating contracts, improved information as a result of CF has the added benefit of countering the adverse effects of double marginalization in addition to reducing the cost of supply demand mismatch. Second, one may expect the value of CF to increase with bargaining power, however this does not hold in general: The value of CF for the newsvendor first increases and then decreases in his bargaining power. Finally, whereas one may expect CF to be more valuable under coordinating contracts, rather than a simple wholesale price contract that is prone to double marginalization, the magnitude of the gain from CF is in many cases higher in the absence of quantity coordination.

The workload is the number of operating room hours used by a medical specialty on a given day to perform surgical procedures. Variable costs consist of wages at a regular (scheduled) rate and at an overtime rate when the realized workload exceeds the scheduled time. Using a newsvendor framework, we consider the problem of determining optimal staffing levels with different information sets available at the time of decision: no information, information on number of cases, and information on number and types of cases. We develop empirical models for the daily workload distribution in which the mean and variance change with the information available. We use these models to derive optimal staffing rules based on historical data from a U.S. teaching hospital and prospectively test the performance of these rules. Our numerical results suggest that hospitals could potentially reduce their staffing costs by up to 39%-49% by deferring staffing decisions until procedure type information is available. The results demonstrate how data availability can affect a newsvendor's performance. The systematic approach of empirical modeling presented in the paper can be applied to other newsvendor problems with heterogeneous sources of demand.

We show that BPS creates an operational synergy between two products that are jointly produced. In essence, BPS is a process innovation that reduces the marginal cost of the original product and/or the by-product. The firm creates value through this process innovation and can capture this value by capturing newly created market opportunities, taking market share from competitors, or licensing the innovation to its competitors. We determine the optimal operating and licensing strategies for the firm and find market conditions under which the firm would benefit most from. implementing BPS. We show that the optimal operating and licensing strategies are driven by the size of the cost reduction enabled by the BPS process innovation. We also show that leveraging the synergies between the original product and by-product can lead to counterintuitive profit-maximizing operating strategies such as increasing the amount of waste generated, and strategically increasing the quantity of original product above the business as usual production volume. We present a framework for assessing the environmental impact of BPS that incorporates the impact of the optimal operating and licensing strategies.

We test these benchmarks in the laboratory by comparing the performance of auctions with rank-based feedback to auctions with full-price feedback as well as to auctions with no price feedback (sealed-bid auctions). When bidders are risk-neutral expected-profit maximizers, the buyer's expected costs should be the same under rank and full-price feedback; moreover, expected buyer costs should be the same as in a sealed-bid auction. However, when we test this theoretical equality in a controlled laboratory setting we find that, consistent with practitioners' beliefs but contrary to our model, rank feedback results in lower average prices than full-price feedback. We identify two behavioral reasons for the difference. The first explanation is based on the similarity of the bidders' problem in a sealed-bid first-price auction and an open-bid auction with rank feedback. The second explanation incorporates the use of jump bids motivated by bidder impatience.

In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth. Our study underscores the importance of in-store operations in driving the financial performance of retailers.

Healthcare costs have always been a driving force in policy and management, but quality has become equally important in driving decisions, particularly since emerging payment systems include metrics on clinical and operational performance. With the increasing use of information technology to capture financial, operational, and clinical data and to coordinate care across time and different venues, there is a growing demand for operations analysts to examine processes of care and provide much-needed insights on how to better utilize resources to improve outcomes while reducing costs. In this paper, I describe some of the essential features of the U.S. healthcare system and some critical issues that provide opportunities for operations researchers to make important contributions.

We find that the proportion of patients assigned a "high-severity" status for reimbursement purposes, which maps, on average, to a 47.8% higher payment for the hospital, is substantially reduced as the workload of the discharging physician increases. This effect persists after we control for a number of systematic differences in patient characteristics, condition, and time of discharge. Furthermore, we show that it is unlikely to be caused by selection bias or endogeneity in either discharge timing or allocation of discharges to physicians. We attribute this phenomenon to a workload-induced reduction in diligence of paperwork execution. We estimate the associated monetary loss to be approximately 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.4%-1.9%) of the department's annual revenue.

We report on a nonstationary partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) for prostate biopsy referral decisions. The core states are the patients' prostate cancer related health states, and PSA test results are the observations. Transition probabilities and rewards are inferred from the Mayo Clinic Radical Prostatectomy Registry and the medical literature. The objective of our model is to maximize expected quality-adjusted life years. We solve the POMDP model to obtain an age and belief (probability of having prostate cancer) dependent optimal biopsy referral policy. We also prove a number of structural properties including the existence of a control-limit type policy for the biopsy referral decision. Our empirical results demonstrate a nondecreasing belief threshold in age, and we provide sufficient conditions under which PSA screening should be discontinued for older patients. Finally, the benefits of screening under the optimal biopsy referral policy are estimated, and sensitivity analysis is used to prioritize the model parameters that would benefit from additional data collection.

Clinical quality measures hospitals' performance on patient safety, i.e., adherence to standards, whereas experiential quality relates to patient centeredness, i.e., responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the patient. Drawing from the organizational learning literature, we argue for a trade-off between clinical and experiential quality as hospitals emphasize process management. We also study how external and internal forces, i.e., state legislation and hospital leadership, influence this relationship. A combination of primary data and secondary data collected at various time intervals is employed to test our hypotheses. Four important implications emerge from this work. First, we find that hospitals' emphasis on process management is associated with an increase in clinical quality but a decrease in experiential quality. Second, we find that state legislation initially reinforces this trade-off but, overtime, facilitates a positive impact of process management on both quality outcomes. Third, a post hoc analysis suggests that a specific type of hospital leadership, namely, patient-centered leadership, helps mitigate the negative association between process management and experiential quality. Finally, our research provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between clinical quality and patient satisfaction contingent on experiential quality. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

The common solution to the first problem (in practice) is to grant exclusive "block time," in which a portion of the week in an operating room is designated to a particular surgeon, barring other surgeons from using this room/time. As a major improvement over this existing approach, we model the possibility of "shared" block time, which need only satisfy capacity constraints in expectation. We reduce the computational difficulty of the resulting NP-hard block-scheduling problem by implementing a column-generation approach and demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using simulation, calibrated to a real hospital's historical data and objectives. Our simulations illustrate substantial benefits to hospitals under a variety of circumstances and demonstrate the advantages of our new approach relative to a benchmark method taken from the recent literature.

We create an analytical model of a tandem queue with finite buffer space to analyze the impact of different work prioritization policies on the throughput and the flow time of patients in the facility-measures that influence both the facility's finances and patients' satisfaction. We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures.

We use clinical data to estimate the parameters of the MDP model and solve it as a mixed-integer program. By repeating optimization for a sequence of budget levels, we calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios attributable to consecutive levels of funding and compare actual clinical practice with optimal decisions. We prove that the optimal value function is concave in the allocated budget. Comparing to actual clinical practice, using optimal thresholds for decision making may result in approximately 22% cost savings without sacrificing QALYs. Our analysis indicates short-term follow-ups are the immediate target for elimination when budget becomes a concern. Policy change is more drastic in the older age group with the increasing budget, yet the gains in total expected QALYs related to larger budgets are predominantly seen in younger women along with modest gains for older women.

However, research notes that not all experience provides equal value for performance. How, then, should surgeons accumulate experience to improve quality outcomes? In this paper, we investigate the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience. We open up the black box of the volume-outcome relationship by going beyond just dividing experience into focal and related categories, but also considering how subtasks and context (i.e., the organization in which the work takes place) affect performance. To understand these issues, we assemble a novel data set on 71 cardiothoracic surgeons who performed more than 6,500 procedures during a period of 10 years after the introduction of a breakthrough surgical procedure. We find that, as compared to related experience, surgeon focal experience has a greater effect on surgeon performance. We also demonstrate that subtask experience has different, nonlinear performance relationships for focal and related experience. Finally, we find that focal experience is more firm specific than related experience and that nonfirm experience reduces the learning rate for both focal and related experience. We discuss implications of our findings for healthcare delivery and operations management.

Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types.

The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an M/D/1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To over-come these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.

Patients with scheduled appointments may or may not show up for their appointments. The service of scheduled patients can be interrupted by emergency requests that have a higher priority. We develop a framework that can be utilized in determining the optimal appointment policies under different assumptions regarding rewards, costs, and decision variables. We propose two methods to evaluate the objective function for a given appointment schedule. We specifically consider two different formulations, both of which aim to balance the trade-off between the patient waiting times and server utilization and carry out a numerical study to provide insights into optimal policies. We find that policies that ignore interruptions perform quite badly, especially when the number of appointments to be scheduled is also a decision variable. We also find that policies that require equally spaced appointments perform reasonably well when the interruption rate is constant. However, their performance worsens significantly when the interruption rate is time dependent.

Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit-the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 1.7% on average, and as much as 5.5%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply-demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3.63% on average and as much as 13.01%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy.

Recognizing that such behavior may not be directly observable by a seller, we examine the implications of seller uncertainty over strategic customer behavior in a markdown pricing setting. We assume that some proportion of customers purchase impulsively in the first period if the price is below their willingness to pay, while other customers strategically wait for lower prices in the second period. We consider a two-period selling season in which the seller knows the aggregate demand curve but not the proportion of customers behaving strategically. We show that a robust pricing policy that requires no knowledge of the extent of strategic behavior performs remarkably well. We extend our model to a setting with stochastic demand, and show that the robust pricing policy continues to perform well, particularly as capacity is loosened or the problem is scaled up. Our results underscore the need to recognize strategic behavior, but also suggest that in many cases effective performance is possible without precise knowledge of strategic behavior.

The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of quality, and strategic in that they decide not only whether and which product variant to buy, but also when to buy, choosing the option that maximizes their utility. We derive the equilibrium of the pricing-purchasing game between the firm and the consumers. We find that the loss due to strategic customer behavior can be less with two product variants compared to the single-product benchmark, which indicates that product variety can serve as a lever when dealing with strategic customers. This benefit exists when the additional product has an inferior cost-to-quality ratio. Because of this benefit, a firm may find it attractive to sell a product variant that would be unprofitable otherwise. However, product variety can also hurt profitability due to strategic customer behavior: A product variant that would be profitable absent strategic customers can in fact be unprofitable. This can happen when customer impatience and firm costs are moderate.

In a typical call center equipped with an IVR system, customers are handled first by the IVR system, which is a computerized system that often enables customers to self-serve. Those customers whose service cannot be handled by the IVR system are sent to the second stage to be served by agents. To address the design of a call center with a flexible IVR system, we consider a call center whose IVR system can operate in two different service delivery modes that have statistically different outcomes. We formulate a stochastic program to determine the number of agents needed in the second stage as well as the proportion of customers that should be selected for each IVR service mode under different demand levels with the objective of minimizing the total staffing and abandonment costs. We also propose dynamic control policies to achieve the optimal proportions without the knowledge of the exact arrival rate. We show that the staffing levels found by the stochastic program combined with the proposed routing policies are asymptotically optimal in large systems. We present extensive numerical and simulation results to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

This paper proposes a simple heuristic for determining stocking levels in a serial inventory system. Unlike the exact optimization algorithm, the heuristic generates a near-optimal solution by solving a series of independent single-stage systems. The heuristic is constructed based on three results we derive. First, we provide a new cost decomposition scheme based on echelon systems. Next, we show that the optimal base-stock level for each echelon system is bounded by those of two revised echelon systems. Last, we prove that the revised echelon systems are essentially equivalent to single-stage systems. We examine the myopic solution for these single-stage systems. In a numerical study, we find that the change of direction of the myopic solution is consistent with that of the optimal solution when system parameters vary. We then derive an analytical expression for the myopic solution and use it to gain insights into how to manage inventory. The analytical expression shows how future demand affects the current optimal local base-stock level; it also explains an observation that the safety stock at an upstream stage is often stable and may not increase when the demand variability increases over time. Finally, we discuss how the heuristic leads to a time-consistent coordination scheme that enables a decentralized supply chain to achieve the heuristic solution.

Flight delays have been attributed to several causes such as weather conditions, airport congestion, airspace congestion, use of smaller aircraft by airlines, etc. In this paper, we examine the impact of the scheduled block time allocated for a flight, a factor controlled by airlines, on on-time arrival performance. We analyze empirical flight data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to estimate the scheduled on-time arrival probability of each commercial domestic flight flown in the United States in 2007 by a major carrier. The structural estimation approach from econometrics is then used to impute the overage to underage cost ratio of the newsvendor model for each flight. Our results show that airlines systematically "underemphasize" flight delays, i.e., the flight delay costs implied by the newsvendor model are less than the implied costs of early arrivals for a large fraction of flights. Our results indicate that revenue drivers (e.g., average fare) and competitive measures (e.g., market share) have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. We also show that the scheduled on-time arrival probability is not positively affected by the total number of passengers on the aircraft rotation who could be affected by a flight delay, or the number of incoming and outgoing connecting passengers on a flight. Operational characteristics such as the hub and spoke network structure also have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. Finally, full-service airlines put a higher weight on the cost of late arrivals than do low-cost carriers, and flying on the lowest fare flight on a route results in a drop in the scheduled on-time arrival probability.

A central element of such a model is its underlying operating policy. We focus on network contracts for the transport capacity of natural gas pipelines, specific energy conversion assets. Practitioners commonly manage these contracts as portfolios of spread options. Although computationally fast, we show that this approach in general is heuristic because of the suboptimality of its operating policy. We propose a different computationally efficient real option approach based on an optimal operating policy, integrating linear optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. We use our approach to benchmark the spread option approach in a numerical study based on market data and realistic instances. We find that our approach can substantially improve on the contract valuations computed by the spread option approach, especially for contracts with flexibility in their allowed capacity usage. We also show that the optimal operating policy of contracts with this flexibility is of the greedy type, whereas the one of contracts without it in general is not. However, we observe that greedy optimization yields a near-optimal operating policy for the latter type of contracts with a substantially reduced computational effort. A version of our model was recently implemented by a major international energy trading company. Our model can also be employed to efficiently estimate the contract value sensitivities (the "Greeks"), which merchants use for financial hedging purposes. Potentially, our work has wider significance for the merchant management of other commodity conversion assets with payoffs determined by solving capacity constrained optimization models.

Energy storage operations typically face limited operational flexibility characterized by the speed of storing and releasing energy, which makes the optimal policy, in general, difficult to compute. A widely used practice-based heuristic, the rolling intrinsic (RI) policy, generally performs well compared with an optimal policy but can significantly underperform in some cases. In this paper, we aim to understand the gap between the RI policy and the optimal policy and leverage the resulting insights to improve the RI policy. A new heuristic policy, the price-adjusted rolling intrinsic (PARI) policy, is developed based on theoretical analysis of storage options. This heuristic adjusts certain prices before applying the RI policy to provide the RI policy with estimates of the values of various storage options. We evaluate the performance of the RI and PARI polices using actual data from the natural gas industry. Our results show that, on average, the PARI policy recovers about 67% of the value loss of the RI policy. Furthermore, when the value loss of the RI policy is larger, the PARI policy tends to recover a higher fraction of that value loss.

The forecast evolves according to the martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE). The newsvendor can place multiple orders with increasing ordering cost over time to satisfy demand that realizes at the end of the planning horizon. In this context, we explore the trade-off between improving demand forecast and increasing ordering cost. We show that the optimal ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy and analytically characterize that the base-stock level depends on the information state in a linear (log-linear) fashion for additive (multiplicative) MMFE. We also study a benchmark model where the newsvendor is restricted to order only once. By comparing the multiordering and single-ordering models, we quantify the impact of the multiordering strategy on the newsvendor's expected profit and risk exposure.

DMEP combines dual-source (i.e., a less-expensive-but-slower base mode and a faster-but-more-expensive flexible mode) procurement with option contracts in three layers: a contract negotiation layer, where the firm chooses the best combination of lead time and price for each mode from the supply contract menu; a capacity reservation layer, where the firm reserves total equipment procurement quantities from the two supply modes before the planning horizon starts; and an execution layer, where the firm orders equipment from the two supply modes based on the updated demand information. We first investigate the execution layer as a dynamic dual-source capacity expansion problem with demand backlogging and demonstrate that the optimal policy lacks structure even under the simplest setting. Thus, we propose a heuristic solution for the execution-layer problem, which also serves as a building block for the other two layers. Through numerical analysis, we quantify the value of the added flexibility of DMEP for the firm. The DMEP framework has been implemented at Intel Corporation and has resulted in savings of tens of millions of dollars for one process technology.

In this paper, we examine the relationships among (1) levers for compliance (at-source pollution prevention, end-of-pipe pollution control, and the use of allowances); (2) environmental performance; and (3) firm market performance for the context of stringent cap and trade regulation with allowance grandfathering (i.e., the allocation of allowances for free). To investigate these relationships, we use data on publicly traded utility firms operating coal-fired generating units regulated by the U. S. Acid Rain Program from three principal sources: the U. S. Energy Information Administration, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Compustat database. Our results indicate a significant relationship between better environmental performance and lower firm market performance over at least a three-year period. From a regulatory perspective, our results show a negative association between allowance grandfathering and firm environmental performance. Overall, by explicitly considering the context of stringent regulation, we find a counter-example to the view that better environmental performance generally associates with better economic performance.

We solve for the buyer's optimal procurement contract. We show that the optimal contract can be interpreted as the buyer choosing between diversification and competition benefits. Better information increases diversification benefits and decreases competition benefits. Therefore, with better information the buyer is more inclined to diversify. Moreover, better information may increase or decrease the value of the dual-sourcing option, depending on the buyer's unit revenue: for large revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for diversification, the benefits of which increase with information; for small revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for competition, the benefits of which decrease with information. Surprisingly, as the reliability of the entire supply base decreases, the buyer may stop diversifying under asymmetric information (to leverage competition), whereas it would never do so under symmetric information. Finally, we analyze the effect of codependence between supply disruptions. We find that lower codependence leads the buyer to rely less on competition. Because competition keeps the information costs in check, a reduction in supplier codependence increases the buyer's value of information. Therefore, strategic actions to reduce codependence between supplier disruptions should not be seen as a substitute for learning about suppliers' reliabilities.

WOS:000304042700005	service management; reservations; restaurants; capacity management	RESTAURANT REVENUE MANAGEMENT; DEMAND; PRICE; MODEL	2	We examine the role of reservations in capacity-constrained services with a focus on restaurants. Although customers value reservations, restaurants typically neither charge for them nor impose penalties for failing to keep them. However, reservations impose costs on firms offering them. We offer a novel motivation for offering reservations that emphasizes the way in which reservations can alter customer behavior. We focus on a market in which demand is uncertain and the firm has limited capacity. There is a positive chance that the firm will not have enough capacity to serve all potential customers. Customers are unable to observe how many potential diners are in the market before incurring a cost to request service. Hence, if reservations are not offered, some may choose to stay home rather than risk being denied service. This lowers the firm's sales when realized demand is low. Reservations increase sales on a slow night by guaranteeing reservations holders service. However, some reservation holders may choose not to use their reservations resulting in no-shows. The firm must then trade off higher sales in a soft market with sales lost to no-shows on busy nights. We consequently evaluate various no-show mitigation strategies, all of which serve to make reservations more likely in equilibrium. Competition also makes reservations more attractive; when there are many small firms in the market, reservations are always offered.

At the same time, the waste-to-energy firm serves and collects revenue from two types of customers: waste generators who pay for waste disposal service and electricity consumers who buy energy. Given the process characteristics of the waste-to-energy operation, the market characteristics for waste disposal and energy, and the mechanisms regulators use to encourage production of renewable energy, we determine the profit-maximizing operating strategy of the firm. We also show how regulatory mechanisms affect the operating decisions of the waste-to-energy firm. Our analyses suggest that if the social planner's objective is to maximize landfill diversion, offering a subsidy as a per kilowatt-hour for electricity is more cost effective, whereas if the objective is to maximize renewable energy generation, giving a subsidy as a lump sum to offset capital costs is more effective. This has different regulatory implications for urban and rural settings where the environmental objectives may differ.

Under such a contract the distributor pays the plant a fixed price if the plant is operational and nothing if plant outage occurs. Pricing a unit-contingent contract is complicated by the fact that the plant's true status is its private information. The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributor's expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered. We find that some type of misreporting under certain circumstances can benefit both the plant and the distributor, because it serves as a risk-allocation mechanism between the two parties. We show that such a risk-allocation mechanism is equivalent to using state-contingent options and prohibiting misreporting.

This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model). Comparisons with simulations confirm that the approximations can be useful to assess the impact of the dependence.

We use a ranking-based consumer choice model to represent consumer preferences: every customer has a ranking of the potential products in the category and purchases his highest ranked product (if any) offered in the assortment. We consider four practically motivated special cases of this model, namely, the one-way substitution, the locational choice, the outtree, and the intree preference models, and we study the retailer's product selection problem when products have different price and cost parameters. We assume that the retailer incurs a fixed carrying cost per product offered, a goodwill penalty for each customer who does not purchase his first choice and a lost sale penalty for each customer who does not find an acceptable product to buy. For the first three models, we obtain efficient solution methods that simplify to either a shortest path method or a dynamic program. For the fourth model, we construct an effective algorithm and show numerically that, in practice, it is much faster than enumeration. We also obtain valuable insights on the structure of the optimal assortment.

When a customer demand occurs at a stocked-out retailer, that retailer requests a unit to be transshipped from another retailer who charges a transshipment price. If this request is rejected, the unsatisfied customer may go to another retailer with a customer overflow probability. Each retailer decides on the initial order quantity from a manufacturer and on the acceptance/rejection of each transshipment request. For two retailers, we show that retailers' optimal transshipment policies are dynamic and characterized by chronologically nonincreasing inventory holdback levels. We analytically study the sensitivity of holdback levels to explain interesting findings, such as smaller retailers and geographically distant retailers benefit more from transshipments. Numerical experiments show that retailers substantially benefit from using optimal transshipment policies compared to no sharing. The expected sales increase in all but a handful of over 3,000 problem instances. Building on the two-retailer optimal policies, we suggest an effective heuristic transshipment policy for a multiretailer system.

In this paper, we study three mechanisms for dealing with product adulteration problems: (a) the deferred payment mechanism-the buyer pays the supplier after the deferred payment period only if no adulteration has been discovered by the customers; (b) the inspection mechanism-the buyer pays the supplier immediately, contingent on product passing the inspection; and (c) the combined mechanism-a combination of the deferred payment and inspection mechanisms. We show that the inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, whereas the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, we identify four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyer's liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product. We find that the deferred payment mechanism is preferable to inspection if the threats of adulteration (either incentive to adulterate or the consequences) are low.

In this paper, we examine drivers of price differentials between new and remanufactured products using data on purchases made on eBay. Our analysis shows that seller reputation significantly explains the price differentials between new and remanufactured products. We also find that products remanufactured by original equipment manufacturers or their authorized factories are purchased at relatively higher prices than products remanufactured by third parties. However, in the presence of these reputation signals (seller reputation and remanufacturer identity), we find that stronger warranties are not significantly associated with higher prices paid for remanufactured products. Our work contributes to the closed-loop supply chain research stream in operations management by empirically examining market factors that have not been studied before.

A manufacturer distributes a durable product through an exclusive retailer to an exhaustible population of consumers with heterogeneous reservation prices. In each period, the manufacturer and retailer in turn set wholesale and retail prices, respectively, and customers with valuation above the retail price adopt the product at a constant (hazard) rate. We derive the open-loop, feedback, and myopic equilibria for this dynamic pricing game and compare it to the centralized solution. Although in an integrated supply chain a forward-looking dynamic pricing strategy is always desirable, we show that this is not the case in a decentralized setting, because of vertical competition. Our main result is that both supply chain entities are better off in the long run when they ignore the impact of current prices on future demand and focus on immediate-term profits. A numerical study confirms that this insight is robust under various supply-and demand-side effects. We use the channel efficiency corresponding to various pricing rules to further derive insights into decisions on decentralization and disintermediation.

We also briefly discuss cases where (1) each product is built at three plants and (2) some products are built at only one plant. An extensive computational study suggests that our refinements work very well for finding flexible configurations with minimum shortfall in unbalanced networks.

Postponement, component commonality, and resource flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our central research question is the following: What are the minimum inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always strictly positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers with perfectly positively correlated demands.

Because of information asymmetry about suppliers' production costs and the use of simple quantity discount or price-only contracts, either delegation or control can yield substantially higher expected profit for the manufacturer. Delegation tends to outperform control when (1) the manufacturer is uncertain about the tier 1 supplier's cost and believes that it is likely to be high; (2) the manufacturer and the tier 1 supplier know the tier 2 supplier's cost or at least that it will be high; (3) the manufacturer has an alternative to engaging the tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers, such as in-house production; and (4) the firms use price-only contracts as opposed to quantity discount contracts. These results shed light on practices observed in the electronics industry.

By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer Once guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the seller's profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season. We also investigate the seller's strategy choice in such a setting (i.e., whether the preorder option should be offered and whether it should be coupled with price guarantees) and find that the answer depends on the relative sizes of the heterogeneous consumer segments.

In this paper, we study a joint implementation of price- and capacity-based substitution mechanisms to alleviate the level of such inventory disparities. We consider a firm producing substitutable products via a capacity portfolio consisting of both product-dedicated and flexible resources and characterize the structure of the optimal production and pricing decisions. We then explore how changes in various problem parameters affect the optimal policy structure. We show that the availability of a flexible resource helps maintain stable price differences across products over time even though the price of each product may fluctuate over time. This result has favorable ramifications from a marketing standpoint because it suggests that even when a firm applies a dynamic pricing strategy, it may still establish consistent price positioning among multiple products if it can employ a flexible replenishment resource. We provide numerical examples for the price stabilization effect and discuss extensions of our results to a more general multiple product setting.

We focus on the role that private information about demand has on firms' ability to align their capacity decisions. When forecasts are private information, there are at most two equilibria: a complete coordination failure or a monotone equilibrium. The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally. Contrary to our theoretical predictions, we show that private demand forecasts do not have a consistently negative effect on firm profits, though capacities are more misaligned. We show that preplay communication may be more effective at increasing profits than truthful information

With the CBS policy, the number of working servers is dynamically adjusted according to the queue length. Besides lining up for free service, customers have the option of paying a fee and getting faster service. Customers' equilibrium behavior is studied under two information scenarios: In the no information scenario, customers only know the long-term statistics, such as the expected waiting time; in the partial information scenario, customers observe the number of working servers and understand the staffing policy upon their arrival. Unlike a queueing system with a constant staffing level, a positive externality is associated with customers' joining the CBS system. Both avoid-the-crowd and follow-the-crowd customer behaviors are possible, and multiple equilibria could exist. We develop the stationary performance measures of the system by considering the customers' strategic behavior. Numerical analysis shows that information can either hurt or improve the performance of the system, depending on the staffing and pricing policy. Another important conclusion is that the system performance is more robust to setting a relatively high than a relatively low price.

The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights.

For simplicity, we assume that every manufacturer as well as the third party each possess a single production facility. Each manufacturer has to decide the amount of workload to be subcontracted so as to minimize the completion time of his in-house and subcontracted workloads. In an effort to provide good service to all, the third party gives priority to manufacturers whose subcontracted workload is small. This incentive scheme forces manufacturers to compete for position in the third-party processing sequence. We develop. pure Nash equilibria schedules under three distinct protocols for production.

To sustain natural ecosystems and human populations with a high standard of living, humanity must now reinvent our systems for the production and delivery of goods and services to dramatically reduce the environmental impacts associated with consumption. The operations management community can contribute critical know-how to do so, as demonstrated by the papers in this special issue.

This paper provides a brief summary of a conceptual framework that we have developed to systematize the study and identification of new business models. Our approach advocates that the key to identifying new business models is understanding the context of decision making in existing models and the associated inefficiencies. We propose a three-step approach: First, existing business models must be audited for identifying information and incentive misalignment inefficiencies that destroy value. Next, new business models can be identified by changing the context of the decision associated with the most consequential of these inefficiencies. We conjecture that four elements of the decision context are most significant: WHAT decisions are made, WHEN they are made, WHO makes them, and WHY they are made. We provide a set of idea triggers to stimulate brainstorming of new business models by changing one of these four Ws. Finally, we advise that generated business models should be analyzed and experimented with to identify the most promising ones. We close the paper by describing the design of a pedagogical program based on this framework.

Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics-and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.

Their responses vary widely. We theorize and empirically identify several factors associated with suppliers being especially willing to share this information with buyers, focusing on attributes of the buyers seeking this information and of the suppliers being asked to provide it. We test our hypotheses using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Program, a collaboration of multinational corporations requesting such information from thousands of suppliers in 49 countries. We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations. We find evidence that these factors also influence the comprehensiveness of the information suppliers share and their willingness to share the information publicly.

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy. We also find that curtailing intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions.

Although previous studies have tried to explain the underinvestment, we focus on how the way in which a portfolio of opportunities is presented in a list affects adoption decisions. We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17% from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms. We also observe a choice overload effect at the portfolio level, but the magnitude of this effect is small.

These more sustainable technologies typically require a higher up-front investment but have lower operating (fuel or energy) costs. What complicates this decision is the fact that the projected dollar savings from the more sustainable technologies fluctuate considerably due to uncertainty in fuel prices, and the total capacity may not be utilized at 100% because of fluctuations in the demand for the product. We consider the firm's capacity adjustments over time given a portfolio of technology options when the demand and the fuel costs are stochastic and possibly dependent. Our model also allows for usage-based capacity deterioration. We provide the analytical structure of the optimal policy, which assigns different control limits for investing, staying put, and disinvesting in the capacities of the competing technology choices for each realization of demand and fuel costs at each period. We also present an application of our model to the problem of designing a delivery truck fleet for a beverage distributor.

Variability in those prices has implications for how much a manufacturer should invest in three fundamental types of process improvement. Input price variability reduces the value of improving input efficiency (output produced per unit input) but increases that of capacity efficiency (the rate at which a production facility can convert input into output). Output price variability increases the value of capacity efficiency, but it increases the value of input efficiency if and only if the expected margin is small. Moreover, as the expected input cost rises, the value of input efficiency decreases. A third type of process improvement is to develop flexibility in input efficiency versus capacity efficiency (the ability to respond to a rise in input cost or fall in output price by increasing input efficiency at the expense of capacity efficiency). The value of this flexibility decreases with variability in input and output prices if and only if the expected margin is thin. Together, these results suggest that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system may reduce investment by basic material manufacturers in improving energy efficiency.

This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firm's development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and considering the product's environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement. However, we also find that accelerated obsolescence, under some conditions, can actually make modular upgradability greener.

Specifically, we determine under what market and regulatory conditions an NGO should target the industry versus the regulatory body to influence firms to replace the substance. We examine how the NGO's strategy changes as the NGO's pragmatism (i.e., the extent to which the NGO incorporates firms' profits into its decision making) increases. Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry and the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGO's activism. We show that the potential for a firm to lobby can benefit consumers by motivating the NGO to exert more effort and increase the market sensitivity to a substance, thereby forcing the firm to replace.

We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling-and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy.

We propose an iterative-descent method for obtaining the parameter estimates and the covariance matrix, and we show that the method is theoretically sound and overcomes the difficulty that the units-in-use population of each product is not observable. We test the model on both simulated sales data and Inters high-end desktop processor sales data. We use two alternative specifications for product strength in this market: performance and performance/price ratio. The former demonstrates better fit and forecast accuracy, likely due to the low price sensitivity of this high-end market. In addition, the parameter estimate suggests that, for the innovators in the diffusion of product adoption, brand switchings are more strongly influenced by product strength than within-brand product upgrades in this market. Our results indicate that compared with the Bass model, Norton-Bass model, and Jun-Park choice-based diffusion model, our approach is a better fit for strategic forecasting that occurs many months or years before the actual product launch.

We construct a fluid model of patient triage in a mass-casualty incident that incorporates these factors and characterize its optimal policy. We use this characterization to obtain useful insights about the type of simple policies that have a good chance to perform well in practice, and we demonstrate how one could develop such a policy. Using a realistic simulation model and data from emergency medicine literature, we show that the policy we developed based on our fluid formulation outperforms START in all scenarios considered, sometimes substantially.

We assume consumer-driven, dynamic, stockout-based substitution and random proportions of each type. No efficient method to obtain the optimal solution for this problem is known to our knowledge. However, if the number of customers of each type is a fixed proportion of demand, there exists an efficient algorithm for solving for the optimal assortment. We show that the fixed proportions model gives an upper bound to the optimal expected profit for the random proportions model. This bound allows us to obtain a measure of the absolute performance of heuristic solutions. We also provide a bound for the component-wise absolute difference in expected sales between the two models, which is asymptotically tight as the inventory vector is made large, while keeping the number of products fixed. This result provides us with a lower bound to the optimal expected profit and a performance guarantee for the fixed proportions solution in the random proportions model.

Given limited display capacity and no a priori information on consumers' utility, the retailer must select which subset of products to offer. By offering different assortments and observing the resulting purchase behavior, the retailer learns about consumer preferences, but this experimentation should be balanced with the goal of maximizing revenues. We develop a family of dynamic policies that judiciously balance the aforementioned trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and prove that their performance cannot be improved upon in a precise mathematical sense. One salient feature of these policies is that they "quickly" recognize, and hence limit experimentation on, strictly suboptimal products.

We examine how unexpected performance along several dimensions of service quality-on-time performance, long delays and cancellations, lost bags, and denied boardings-impacts contemporaneous stock returns. Prior research suggests that airlines buffer their flight schedules and engage in expensive employee incentive programs to increase the likelihood of on-time arrival. We find that only long delays are penalized by the market, and we identify a number of carrier-specific factors that alter the financial impact of long delays. We find that the penalty a carrier faces for long delays is significantly higher if it operates a high percentage of short-haul or connecting flights, or if its competitors incur fewer long delays in the same time period. Our findings suggest that developing ways to curtail long delays is a useful future research area.

We consider this question for a queueing system with two customer types and provide the following results. First, we develop a novel problem formulation and solution method that combines the achievable region approach with mechanism design. This approach extends to menu design problems for other systems. Second, the work conserving c mu priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A strategic delay policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies. Third, we identify general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal strategic delay: a price, a lead-time, and a segment-size condition. We translate these into demand and capacity parameter conditions for cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous valuations for each type. In some cases strategic delay is optimal if capacity is relatively abundant, in others if it is relatively scarce.

It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context.

WOS:000321085500008	capacity planning and investment; incentives and contracting; risk management; supply chain management	RESERVATION CONTRACTS; INVESTMENT; INFORMATION	3	Motivated by the dual-sourcing and contracting practices in the semiconductor industry, we study two prevailing types of contracts that deal with horizontal-capacity-coordination issues between two possible sources: an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and a foundry IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under a-contracts, a fixed fraction a of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDM's expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection. Our analysis offers supporting rationale for the coexistence of a-contracts and reservation contracts in practice and provides insights on horizontal capacity coordination beyond the semiconductor industry

We view products as collections of components linked together to work as an integrated whole. Previous work has established modularity (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and cyclicality (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components). We find cyclicality to be a determinant of quality that is distinct from, and no less important than, modularity. Extending this main result, we show how the cyclicality quality relationship is affected by the centrality of a component in a cycle and the distribution of a cycle across product modules. These findings, which are based on an analysis of open source software development projects, have implications for the study and design of complex systems.

However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing.

The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firm's cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal. Moreover, we find that hedging may lead to inventory reduction in multiperiod problems. Thus the insights from the single-period studies in the literature hedging leads to inventory increase do not apply. Finally, insights are offered on the role and impact of inventory and financial hedge on profitability, variance control, and service level, using both analytical and numerical results.

The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered load analysis looks at the amount of capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems. Given the distribution of the stochastic offered load, we often can set staffing levels to stabilize performance at target levels, even in face of a strongly time-varying arrival rate, long service times, and network structure.

S. government has mandated that, in a catastrophic event, metropolitan areas need to be capable of caring for 50 burn-injured patients per million population. In New York City, this corresponds to 400 patients. There are currently 140 burn beds in the region, which can be surged up to 210. To care for additional patients, hospitals without burn centers will be used to stabilize patients until burn beds become available. In this work, we develop a new system for prioritizing patients for transfer to burn beds as they become available and demonstrate its superiority over several other triage methods. Based on data from previous burn catastrophes, we study the feasibility of being able to admit 400 patients to burn beds within the critical three- to five-day time frame. We find that this is unlikely and that the ability to do so is highly dependent on the type of event and the demographics of the patient population. This work has implications for how disaster plans in other metropolitan areas should be developed.

These models predict that inventories carried by a retailer should be a function of the product variety carried by the retailer, distribution system characteristics, economies of scale, etc. A few recent empirical studies have explored the impact of some of these factors on aggregate inventories at U. S. retailers. Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U. S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels. Increased demand fluctuations are also associated with higher inventories, although the effects are less robust. The significant variables together with retailer segment identifiers explain a substantial fraction of the variance in inventory levels and can be potentially useful to managers in benchmarking their inventory levels.

This decision is complicated when servers must be equitably-as well as efficiently-dispatched to customers. In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival. Four types of equity constraints are considered-two of which reflect customer equity and two of which reflect server equity-all of which draw upon the decision analytic and social science literature to compare the effects of different notions of equity on the resulting dispatching policies. The Markov decision processes are formulated as equity-constrained linear programming models. A computational example is applied to an EMS system to compare the different equity models.

The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers. We show that the mechanisms can be efficiently computed and highlight the impact of the improved sharing of surface water. We also study the movement of the price of water with its scarcity. Ideas that can help administer the mechanisms in practice are briefly discussed.

In this paper, we consider a facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments. Whereas most existing models in the literature implicitly assume that the disruption probability estimate is perfectly accurate, we investigate the impact of misestimating the disruption probability. Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability. Thus, managers should focus more on accurately estimating the disruption probability than the correlation.

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.

In contrast, in this paper we study canonical service models with boundedly rational customers. We capture bounded rationality using a model in which customers are incapable of accurately estimating their expected waiting time. We investigate the impact of bounded rationality from both a profit-maximizing firm's perspective and a social planner's perspective. For visible queues with the optimal price, bounded rationality results in revenue and welfare loss; with a fixed price, bounded rationality can lead to strict social welfare improvement. For invisible queues, bounded rationality benefits the firm when its level is sufficiently high. Ignoring bounded rationality, when present yet small, can result in significant revenue and welfare loss.

Emergency jobs need to be served immediately, whereas elective jobs can wait. Distributional information about demand and resource availability is continually updated, and we allow jobs to renege. We prove that our formulation is convex, and the optimal amount of capacity reserved for emergency jobs in each period decreases with the number of elective jobs waiting for service. However, the optimal policy is difficult to compute exactly. We develop the idea of a limit policy starting at a particular time, and use this policy to obtain upper and lower bounds on the decisions of an optimal policy in each period, and also to develop several computationally efficient policies. We show in computational experiments that our best policy performs within 1.8% of an optimal policy on average.

We study an observable M/M/1 queue that serves an unknown proportion of patient and impatient customers. The provider has a Bernoulli prior on this proportion, corresponding to an optimistic or pessimistic scenario. For every queue length, she chooses a low or a high price, or turns customers away. Only the high price is informative. The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure. The optimal Bayesian pricing policy as a function of queue length has a zone (or, nested-threshold) structure. Moreover, the price convergence under the optimal Bayesian policy is sensitive to the system size, i.e., the maximum queue length. We identify two cases: prices converge (1) almost surely to the optimal prices in either scenario or (2) with positive probability to suboptimal prices. Only Case 2 is consistent with the typical incomplete learning outcome observed in the literature.

We model the first two strategies as single-period Stackelberg games, and we model the last strategy as a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental-the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental-the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer.

In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level. The agent earns zero rent in the additive effort case but may earn a positive rent in the multiplicative effort case. Finally, our numerical analysis shows that demand censorship can have a significant negative impact on the value of contracting with the sales agent, especially when the sales margin is low and the market uncertainty is high.

For example. better performing process-focused plants not only achieve higher machine flexibility levels and lower overhead costs as expected, but also have more intensive preventive maintenance programs. Similarly, product-focused plants that achieve certain hallmarks of process-focused plants also enjoy superior performance.

The objective of this study was to determine optimal (s, S) policies for a large number of products and locations. To this end, we evaluate the long run average cost and service level for a fixed (s, S) policy and then used a search procedure to locate an optimal policy. The search procedure: is based on an efficient updating scheme for the transition probability matrix of the underlying Markov chain, bounds on S and monotonicity assumptions on the cost and service level functions. A distinguishing feature of this model is that lead times are shorter than review periods so that the stationary analysis underlying computation of costs and sen ice levels requires subtle analyses. We compared the computed policies to those currently in use on a test bed of 420 products and found that stores currently hold inventories that are 40% to 50% higher than those recommended by our model and estimate that implementing the proposed policies for the entire system would result in significant cost savings.

Optimal allocation guidelines are provided, and the interplay of three factors on the resulting allocation scheme is captured. These factors are the current level of customers' perceptions of service quality at each stage, the cost of implementing a service quality improvement at each stage, and the importance placed by customers at each stage. Sensitivity analysis to provide additional managerial insights is also performed. We demonstrate the applicability of the modeling framework, using data from a real life health care environment.

Customers have a maximum and the firm has a minimum net price to due date trade off curve for each job. The demand management function bargains with the customer over price and promised due date. Bargaining finishes either with an agreed price and delivery date or with the customer refusing the firm's bid and placing the order elsewhere. The firm's objective is to maximize its long-term net revenue. The firm's demand management negotiation strategy guides this bidding process. The research demonstrates the use of simulation to test different demand management bidding and negotiation strategies for different market and firm scenarios. The demonstration uses 16 scenarios to test the different demand management negotiation strategies with a model of a classical job shop in a classical market. The investigation examines finite scheduling-based due date estimation methods, as well as the more traditional parameter-based methods. This demonstration shows that it is possible to test different bidding policies, using a simulation model of a firm and its customers, and to obtain usable results.

By leveraging the commonalities among products in a family, the decision support methodology presented in the paper helps choose components and suppliers that minimize the sum of design, procurement, and usage costs. The problem of integrated component and supplier selection is conceptualized and formulated as an integer-programming model. Analysis of the model yields two properties, complete and continuous replacement, which form the basis of a heuristic procedure. Computational tests show that the heuristic provides results close to the optimal solution and can be used for selecting components and suppliers. Application of the model to an industrial problem is discussed.

The analyses of these models have been carried out in the literature only under the assumption that unsatisfied demand is fully backlogged. The lost sales situation occurs in many retail establishments such as department stores and supermarkets. We use the analysis of the Markovian demand model with backlogging to analyze the lost sales case; in particular, we establish the optimality of an (s, S)-type policy under fairly general conditions.

The model takes into consideration return paths, Erlang distributed service times, and pull-type dispatching rule, assuming finite buffer capacities. Since it has no product-form solution and natural decomposability due to complex nontree fork-cum-join architecture and dynamic dispatching rules, we propose a machine-based decomposition algorithm for the performance evaluation of the model. Each decomposed module consists of the processing machine and its dispatching station. Three how probabilities, derived from flow conservation analysis, relate the modules, which are updated iteratively until the parameters converge. The numerical results from a real-life AGV system application show that the algorithm is reasonably accurate.

This study begins to fill that void using a large, random sample of manufacturing sires. The results show that quality practices can be categorized into nine dimensions. However, not all of them contribute to superior quality outcomes. "Employee commitment," "shared vision," and "customer focus" combine to yield a positive correlation with quality outcomes. Conversely, other ''hard'' quality practices, such as "benchmarking," "cellular work teams," "advanced manufacturing technologies," and "close supplier relations" do not contribute to superior quality outcomes.

We assess the magnitude of raw materials? work-in-process, and finished goods inventories held at automotive supply plants. Inventories are shown to be jointly determined by technological and managerial factors in a manner roughly; consistent with classical inventory theory. Several categories of managerial practices are found to be important Low inventories are linked to employee problem solving and frequent communication with customers; More unexpectedly, we find the absence of inventory differences between U.S.-owned and Japanese-owned plants in North America. This contrasts with substantial differences in inventory holding between US plants and those in Japan.

We focus particularly on the tradeoff between expected work-in-process (or product leadtime) and capacity investment in job shops. We review the algorithms in the literature to derive tradeoff curves and illustrate their application in evaluating the efficiency of the system, in deciding how much capacity to have, how to allocate resources between the reduction of uncertainty and the introduction of new technologies,and how to assess the impact of changes in products throughput and product mix. The methodology is illustrated with an example derived from an actual application in the semiconductor industry.

The subject of this research is the MPS control system: the method used in determining the amount of stock planned for production in each time period. Typically, MPS control systems utilize a single buffer stock. Here, two MPS dual-buffer stock systems are developed and tested by simulation. We extend the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology to aid in the evaluation of the simulation results, where DEA serves to increase the scope of the experimental design. Results indicate that the dual-buffer control systems outperform existing policies.

Order picking is the retrieval of items from their warehouse storage locations to satisfy customer orders. Five order picking policies, strict order, batch, sequential zone, batch zone, and wave, are evaluated using labor requirements, processing time, and customer service as performance measures. A simulation model was developed to investigate these picking policies in a mail order environment. Prior research has focused on the study of individual picking policies. This study extends the prior research by evaluating multiple picking policies under varying operating conditions. The results of the study seem to indicate that (1) wave picking and batch picking perform well across the range of operating conditions considered in this study, and (2) sequential zone and batch zone picking do not perform well, especially as the order volume increases. However, the benefits and drawbacks to each picking policy must be taken into account. The key to effective implementation of an order picking system is to match the firm's business strategy, capabilities, technology, and space requirements with an order picking policy that maximizes the benefits of order picking to the firm and its customers.

A simulation model of a job shop was used to test the modified SPT rule. The performance measures evaluated were mean flow time, flow time variance, and mean lateness. Conditions under which the spr modification improved results were as follows: Large number of transfer batches, small setup time to process time ratio, and large variation in process times from station to station. The results suggest that shop lending is not a significant factor affecting performance of the modified SPT rule.

This paper therefore compares the three different systems. The results show that Conwip consistently produces the shortest mean customer wait time and lowest total work-in-process. Our results also contradict the finding of a previous study, which showed that Dual-kanban performed better than Single-kanban. The different findings can, however, be attributed to the use of a material transfer policy, which favors the Dual-kanban modeled in the previous study. Our study shows that transferring replenished containers immediately to downstream stations, increasing the number of cards, and reducing the withdrawal cycle reduce the mean customer wait time significantly.

In this paper, we develop a Markov decision process model that simultaneously determines maintenance and production schedules for a multiple-product, single-machine production system, accounting for the fact that equipment condition can affect the yield of different product types differently. The problem was motivated by an application in semiconductor manufacturing. After examining structural properties of the optimal policy, we compare the combined method to an approach often used in practice. In the nearly 6,000 test problems studied, the reward from the combined method was an average of more than 25 percent greater than the reward from the traditional method.

Less well known or understood, however, is the phenomenon of amplification as one looks "upstream" in the industrial supply chain. We examine the amplification phenomenon and its implications through the lens of one upstream industry that is notorious for the intensity of the business cycles it faces: the machine tool industry. Amplification of demand volatility in capital equipment supply chains, e.g., machine tools, is particularly large relative to that seen in distribution and component parts supply chains. We present a system dynamics simulation model to capture demand volatility amplification in capital supply chains. We explore the lead-time, inventory, production, productivity, and staffing implications of these dynamic forces. Several results stand out. First, volatility hurts productivity and lowers average worker experience. Second, even though machine tool builders can do little to reduce the volatility in their order streams through choice of forecast rule, a smoother forecasting policy will lead companies to retain more of their skilled work force. This retention of skilled employees is often cited as one of the advantages that European and Japanese companies have had relative to their U.S. competitors. Our results suggest some insights for supply chain design and management: downstream customers can do a great deal to reduce the volatility for upstream suppliers through their choice of order forecast rule. In particular, companies that use smoother forecasting policies tend to impose less of their own volatility upon their supply base and may consequently enjoy system-wide cost reduction.

This paper provides a review of static and deterministic flowshop scheduling research involving machine setup times. The literature is classified into four broad categories, namely sequence independent job setup times, sequence dependent job setup rimes, sequence independent family setup times, and sequence dependent family setup times. Using the suggested classification scheme, this paper organizes the flowshop scheduling literature involving setup and/or removal times and summarizes the existing research for different flowshop problem types. This review reveals that, while a considerable body of literature on this subject has been created, there still exist several potential areas worthy of further research.

While this problem has been addressed in the literature, the focus here is on developing simple, closed-form expressions for the order quantities. The benefit of such an approach is that the solutions are straightforward to calculate and have managerial appeal. Additionally, we show these expressions to be optimal under a variety of conditions. For more general cases when these optimality conditions do not hold, we use these expressions as heuristic solutions. Via computational studies, we demonstrate that these heuristics are extremely effective when the optimality conditions are not satisfied.

This allows us to pursue interesting new fields of inquiry and makes us ever more relevant to the needs of practitioners. But it also increases the risk that over time our efforts will become fragmented and unfocused, causing us to slowly lose our sense of community and break up into separate camps.

I describe the experience of one academic organization that faced a similar problem several years ago and how the situation was resolved.

When the findings of one study are also obtained in other studies, using entirely different databases, we become more confident in the results. Replication alleviates concerns about spurious results and is one motivation for this study. We examine aspects of the tradeoffs concept, production competence paradigm, and a manufacturing strategy taxonomy framework. In regard to the tradeoffs concept, we found evidence of tradeoffs between some, but certainly not all, manufacturing capabilities of quality, cost, delivery, and customization. The relationships get sharper when controlling for process choice. For example, the tradeoff between cost and customization is particularly strong between plants that have different process choices. We find that such tradeoffs can changer or even disappear, however, once the process choice is in place. With respect to the production competence paradigm, our analysis shows a statistically significant correlation between production competence and operations performance in batch shops, but not in plants with other process choices, Finally, using variables similar to those of Miller and Roth, our data produced three similar clusters even though their unit of analysis was much more macro than ours. Controlling for process choice is consistent with the current manufacturing strategy literature that emphasizes dynamic development of capabilities within the context of path dependencies. A major argument of this strand of research is that operations decisions not only affect current capabilities, but also set the framework for development of capabilities in the future. That being the case, controlling for process choice (or other factors such as industry or markets) should contribute to the understanding of capability-development paths adopted by different manufacturing plants. In short, we found at least partial support for each of the theories examined here, even though the theories seem on the surface to be contradictory and mutually exclusive. Controlling for process choice or other measures of dependency goes a long way in uncovering consistency across different theories and empirical studies in operations management.

When using optimal lot sizes in both the automated and labor environments. cost savings from flexible automation may be smaller than expected or may occur in different ways than anticipated.

In quality management, the degree of customer satisfaction for a given product may be measured in the form of the loss to society. This loss is formulated as a function of the deviation from the target for each of the product's quality characteristics. The greater the variability of uncontrolled factors during manufacturing or production the larger will be that loss. In this paper, we develop a form of the loss function that takes into account the variability of a production process, the decision loss, and the costs of sampling and inspection. Specifically, we consider monitoring a production process, which may undergo continuous mean shift and variance deterioration during a production run. We then examine decision rules for continuing production or stopping and adjusting the production process.

We propose a simulation game designed to teach service-oriented supply chain management principles and to test whether managers use them effectively. For example, using a sample of typical student results, we determine that student managers can effectively use end-user demand information to reduce backlog and capacity adjustment costs. The game can also demonstrate the impact of demand variability and reduced capacity adjustment time and lead times.

The game, drawing upon an actual situation, models the jobs of nine supply chain activities required to transform an order placed by the customer into a delivered product. Using the detail and complexity of the game, instructors can develop learning exercises that focus on a wide range of supply chain management issues. This paper describes two learning exercises with different objectives and for different audiences that we successfully delivered using the Brief Case Game. One exercise provides a concrete example of typical activities in a supply chain and their interactions. The other exercise leads students to discover what creates a need for coordination, what activities in a supply chain require coordination, and what methods work well. These exercises are suited for small upper level undergraduate and graduate courses in logistics and supply chain management. While significant resources were used to develop exercises and deliver the game, students were enthusiastic about the approach and demonstrated that they learned about the complexity inherent in managing supply chains.

The right practices can take companies to great heights; lack of attention can draw companies close to peril. In teaching supply chain management to business executives, there are four major issues that need to be highlighted: flawless execution of operations, the change from supply to demand focus, outsourcing and supply base development, and partnership implementation. This article explains these four issues, and the material that is developed at IMD to teach each of them.

One approach to evaluating the intellectual health of a discipline is an examination of doctoral dissertation research. This work both complements and extends other published reviews of the quality management discipline by analyzing doctoral dissertation research since 1981, categorizing this research, examining shifts in major research themes, evaluating data collection and analysis methodologies, and discussing general trends in this research area. Our findings suggest that the challenges in Qm have become more interdisciplinary and integrated, and reveal an encouraging trend toward more rigorous research methodologies and the increased use of theories from other disciplines, leading to a more mature body of research in this field.

This is in contrast with the manufacturing strategy contingency approach of Operations Management that advocates internal and external consistency between manufacturing strategy choices. This article empirically investigates whether quality management practices are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy context, by examining the use of process quality management practices-a critical and distinctive subset of the whole set of quality management practices-across plants representative of different manufacturing strategy contexts. The study strongly suggests that process quality management practices are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy, and identifies mechanisms by which this takes place.

The framework hypothesizes that a service guarantee can positively affect service quality through its positive effect on both learning through service failure and employee motivation and vision. A longitudinal, empirical study was conducted to test these hypotheses. Surprisingly, the service guarantee was not found to have a direct effect on learning through service failure. However, the service guarantee clearly had a positive effect on service quality primarily through its positive effect on employee motivation and vision. The research strongly supports using a service guarantee to improve service quality.

Using data from multiple levels of employees in manufacturing units in various industries, we tested hypotheses regarding the managerial performance impact of the synergy in work force management practices and the quality emphasis. The results indicate that the effectiveness of work force management practices in enhancing managerial performance varies with the emphasis on quality that is manifested by meeting and exceeding customer needs and preferences through accurate, consistent, reliable, and durable products, and by making design changes in the products as desired by the customer.

As such, theory construction and rigorous empirical testing is a relatively recent development with the emphasis very much on quality practices. However, the various dimensions of quality performance and the relationship between them have received less attention from the research community. More specifically, the role of design quality has not been fully addressed in empirical studies. To address this gap we developed a path model incorporating quality practices, design quality, conformance quality, external quality-in-use, product cost, time-to-market, customer satisfaction and business performance. The model was tested with data collected from 200 suppliers in the electronics sector in the Republic of Ireland. Data analysis of the data indicated considerable support for the conceptual model.

We draw on two unique surveys of 31 automobile assembly plants in North America and Japan, which contain information on manufacturing practice and environmental performance, as well as in-depth interviews with 156 plant level employees at 17 assembly plants. Our survey results and interviews suggest that lean management and reduction of air emissions of volatile organic compounds (vocs) are associated negatively. Lean manufacturing practices contribute to more efficient use of paints and cleaning solvents, but these in-process changes are not sufficient to meet the most stringent air regulations. We found some evidence to support the link between lean practices and resource efficiency. While our survey results were in hypothesized direction, they were not statistically significant. In-depth semi-structured interviews, however, suggest a more robust relationship, and we use them to describe some mechanisms by which all three aspects of lean management (buffer minimization, work systems, and human resource management) may be related to environmental management practices and performance.

We find that those establishments that adopt the quality management standard ISO 9000 are more likely to adopt the environmental management standard ISO 14000. We also find strong evidence that lean production, as measured by ISO 9000 adoption and low chemical inventories, is complementary to waste reduction and pollution reduction.

Synthesizing earlier,research, environmental management orientation is defined here to include system analysis and planning, organizational responsibility, and management controls. The relationship between a proactive orientation and two sets of internal factors, specifically the personal views of plant managers and plant-specific characteristics, was tested using survey data from the furniture industry. The production outlook for the plant was critical, with a favorable outlook fostering a more proactive environmental management, orientation. After controlling for plant-specific factors, personal views also were influential; an increasing emphasis on short-term economic value was related to a more reactive plant-level orientation. Thus senior corporate management can foster strong plant-level environmental management through a more balanced emphasis on economic and ethical values and continued investment in a plant's long-term viability.

This paper shows that the perceived competitiveness impact of the standard depends mostly on the involvement of firms' external stakeholders (distributors, customers, community members, and regulatory agencies) in its design. ISO 14001 is a process standard, and it is difficult for stakeholders to get credible information on the effectiveness of the standard if they are not involved in its design. Stakeholders' involvement in a firm's ISO 14001 standard becomes a valuable organizational capability, which is difficult to imitate by competitors. The analysis is supported by primary data collected from a questionnaire mailed to 152 firms, resulting in 55 observations representing 30% of the total number of firms certified in the U.S. in August 1998.

We develop a framework for analyzing the profitability of reuse activities and show how the management of product returns influences operational requirements. We show that the acquisition of used products may be used as the control lever for the management and profitability of reuse activities. These activities, termed product acquisition management, affect several important business decisions. First, if a firm is to pursue reuse activities. these reuse activities must be value-creating. Second, if a firm is to compete by offering remanufactured products, then we show how product returns management influences the overall profitability of such activities via a trial and error EVA(R) approach. Third, we show how operational issues are strongly affected by the approach used to manage product returns. There is a need for future research specifying the mathematical relationship between acquisition price and the nominal quality of the returned product.

However, they have little guidance on how these capabilities can be developed. This paper provides an initial analysis of the role of supply management capabilities in green supply. We argue that the implementation of green supply is better explained by focusing on the development and deployment of an organization's specialized internal resources, rather than by the more usual focus on external environmental pressures on a firm. Further. we argue that capabilities appropriate for green supply are developed by a proactive corporate environmental stance and by a more strategic purchasing and supply management approach. We test our model using data from a two-phase survey of 70 operating units within UK public limited companies. Our results indicate support for our conjecture that supply management capabilities are jointly developed by a proactive corporate environmental approach and a strategic purchasing and supply process. Our study results should be useful to business strategists, regulators, and researchers interested in the predictors of corporate green behavior. They should also assist future researchers in many branches of environmental management who are seeking to explore the role of the internal capabilities of firms in supporting environmental management.

Companies that outsource production may face residual liability for damages from use of their products, when liabilities are large enough to exceed supply chain partners' assets. The resulting potential liabilities can be mitigated through product stewardship.

Transportation is frequently a major component of this life-cycle impact. Hence, to reduce total environmental impact, logistics managers will have to become more sophisticated in their understanding of how they can reduce the environmental impact of their transportation operations, without negatively affecting the cost or effectiveness of these operations. In line with this mandate, we quantify the dynamic impact of road vehicles on the environment. In most emission models, a constant speed is used depending only on the specific road type. Using such a model will lead to an underestimation of the effective emissions. It turns out that the differences with a more realistic dynamic assessment model are significant. The analysis here suggests that the policy consequences of these differences for both public sector managers and private companies are potentially quite important.

With the objective to reduce cost, these retailers are directing suppliers to take full responsibility for managing stocks and deliveries. Suppliers' performance is measured according to how often inventory is shipped to the retailer, and how often customers are unable to purchase the product because it is out of stock. This emerging trend also implies that suppliers are absorbing a large part of the inventory and delivery costs and, therefore, must plan delivery programs including delivery frequency to ensure that the inherent costs are minimized. With the idea to incorporate this shift in focus, this paper looks at the problem facing the supplier who wants quicker replenishment at lower cost. In particular, we present a model that seeks the best trade-off among inventory investment, delivery rates, and permitting shortages to occur, given some random demand pattern for the product. The process generating demand consists of two components: one is deterministic and the other is random. The random part is assumed to follow a compound Poisson process. Furthermore, we assume that the supplier may fail to meet uniform shipping schedules, and, therefore, uncertainty is present in delivery times. The solution to this transportation-inventory problem requires determining jointly delivery rates and stock levels that will minimize transportation, inventory, and shortage costs. Several numerical results are presented to give a feel of the optimal policy's general behavior.

The mathematical model that describes the problem uses the concept of echelon stock and includes lead times. Setup times are taken into account, which implies that the problem of finding a feasible solution is NP-Complete. This paper proposes a heuristic method that provides a production plan in order to minimize inventory, production, and Setup costs. The heuristic starts from a solution for the uncapacitated problem, which is given by the sequential application of the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. Feasibility is then attempted by shifting production amounts between periods. Computational tests conducted in 1,800 instances with LIP to 40 components and 18 periods have shown that feasible solutions were obtained in 83.7% of the instances. For the infeasible instances. on average, the heuristic is able to find solutions with very low capacity excess. The solutions' quality is evaluated through a lower bound provided by Lagrangean relaxation and on average the gap is less than 10%.

Its usefulness for testing theory is under-appreciated. This paper uses critical aspects of the history of manufacturing to provide support for the Theory of Swift, Even Flow as an explanation of productivity gain. The rise of Britain in the Industrial Revolution and the rapid overtaking of Britain by the United States and Germany are argued to be thoroughly consistent with Swift, Ever Flow, thereby vindicating both theory and the usefulness of history.

In this paper, a mixed integer programming (MIP) ATP model is presented. This model can provide an order-promising and -fulfillment solution for a batch of orders that arrive within a predefined batching interval. A variety of constraints, such as raw material availability, production capacity, material compatibility, and customer preferences, are considered. Simulation experiments using the model investigate the sensitivity of supply chain performance to changes in certain parameters, such as batching interval size and customer order flexibility.

We model a single product with two demand classes, where one class requests a lower order fulfillment lead time but pays a higher price. Demand for each class follows a Poisson process. Inventory is fed by a production system with exponentially distributed build times. We study rationing policies in which the firm either blocks or backlogs orders for the lower priority customers when inventory drops below a certain level. We compare the performance of these rationing policies with a pure first-come, first-serve policy under various scenarios for customer response to delay: lost sales, backlog, and a combination of lost sales and backlog.

E-commerce has been hyped as a catalyst for vast streamlining of the supply chain. Yet, in a time of such phenomenal change, the focus tends to be on the large picture. Many details of how a new technology should be or is employed tend to be unknown or ignored. However, as the technology matures and stabilizes, one of the primary factors that separate winners from losers is the way in which the technology is implemented and operated on a daily basis. This study examines the ways in which companies utilize the Internet to streamline their purchasing process. A survey of 416 customers of a major Internet retailer of commodity office supplies reveals important relationships between web site design, employee work environments, Internet strategy, and purchasing performance. Our sample of companies consists of firms that have ordered office supplies at least once using the Internet. Our data indicate that companies do realize performance benefits from utilizing the Internet as a purchasing tool. Furthermore, the data suggest factors that facilitate purchasing process improvements. These factors can be utilized by both buying and selling companies to improve their proprietary processes to maximize the benefits of e-commerce as a purchasing tool.

Suppliers offer all-units and/or incremental quantity discounts, which may vary over time. Although the problem refers to a typical planning task of a purchasing agent, which is often solved without algorithmic assistance, in an eBusiness (B2B) environment, the need for the integration of an automatic performance of this planning task into a web-based procurement process becomes evident. A new model formulation for this problem is developed, and a simple but easily extendible heuristic procedure is presented and tested. The heuristic is implemented as part of the Advanced Planner and Optimizer (APO) software of SAP AG, Walldorf, Germany.

These broader product lines may help to increase market share and may allow higher prices to be charged, but they also cause challenges associated with diseconomies of scope. To investigate this tradeoff, we considered a monopolist who faces demand curves, which for each of its potential products, decline with both price and response time (time to deliver the product). The firm must decide which products to offer, how to price them, whether each should be make-to-stock (NITS) or make-to-order (MTO), and how often to produce them. The offered products share a single manufacturing facility. Setup times introduce disceonomies of scope and Setup costs introduce economies of scale. We provide motivating problem scenarios, model the monopolist's problem as a non-linear, integer programming problem, characterize of the optimal policy, develop near-optimal procedures, and discuss managerial insights.

This model provides an alternative explanation for much of what other outsourcing theories predict, as well as making several new predictions. In particular, we show that outsourcing decisions can create a path-dependent outsourcing trap in which a firm experiences higher long-run costs after an immediate cost benefit. We also describe conditions under which outsourcing a small fraction of component production may dominate either complete insourcing or complete outsourcing. Finally, we show that, with discounting, there is a convex, curvilinear relationship between the optimal outsourcing fraction and the rate of technological change.

High levels of product variety require correspondingly high levels of inventory of each item to quickly respond to customer demand. Delayed product differentiation has been identified as a strategy to reduce final product inventories while providing the required customer service levels. However, it is done so at the cost of devoting large production capacities to the differentiation stage. We study the impact of this postponement capacity on the ability to achieve the benefits of delayed product differentiation. We examine a single-period capacitated inventory model and consider a manufacturing system that produces a single item that is finished into multiple products. After assembly, some amount of the common generic item is completed as non-postponed products. whereas some of the common item is kept as in-process inventory, thereby postponing the commitment to a specific product. The non-postponed finished-goods inventory is used first to meet demand. Demand in excess of this inventory is met, if possible, through the completion of the common items. Our results indicate that a relatively small amount of postponement capacity is needed to achieve all of the benefits of completely delaying product differentiation for all customer demand. This important result will permit many firms to adopt this delaying strategy who previously thought it to be either technologically impossible or prohibitively expensive to do so.

Northco was facing high working capital costs while also incurring high stockout and markdown costs. This paper models the impact of inventory holding cost and reactive capacity on Northco's targeted understocking and overstocking cost and offers a solution methodology for such problems. We quantify the impact of varying inventory carrying costs (and hence, high working capital costs) on stockout costs and the value of additional capacity. Our results illustrate that apparel manufacturers with high working capital costs, and hence high inventory carrying costs, should target higher stockout costs and achieve lower capacity utilization. The results presented have application beyond Northco because high working capital cost is endemic to many supply chains.

It is assumed that the utility of the product varies among potential customers and decreases over time, and that a potential customer will place an order if his or her utility is higher than the manufacturer's posted price. Once an order is placed, it will be delivered to the customer after a length of time called "leadtime." Because of the decrease in a customer's utility during leadtime, a customer will cancel the order if the utility falls below the ordering price before the order is received. The manufacturer may choose to offer discounted prices to customers who would otherwise cancel their orders. We discuss two price policies: common discounted price and customized discounted price. In the common discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers a single lower price to the customers; in the customized discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers the customers separately for individual new prices. Our analytical and numerical studies show that the discounted price policies results in higher revenue and that the customized discounted price policy significantly outperforms the common discounted price policy when product utility decreases rapidly. We also study two leadtime policies when production cost decreases over time. The first uses a fixed leadtime. and the second allows the leadtime to vary dynamically over time. We find that the dynamic leadtime policy significantly outperforms the fixed leadtime policy when the product cost decreases rapidly.

If obtained, orders are processed in a make-to-order facility, after which revenue is received, minus tardiness penalty if the delivery was later than quoted.

The offer is accepted when the inventory position is lower than a threshold level. We compare three different pricing policies in which demand is induced by the reseller's price variation. Policy I is the EOQ policy without discount offers. Policy 2 is a uniform price, stock-independent policy. Policy 3 is a stock level-dependent, discriminated price policy. Assuming constant demand rates, expressions are obtained for the optimal order quantities, prices, and profits. The numerical experiments show that if it is better to accept a supplier's discount, then it benefits the reseller to transfer the discount to downstream customers.

The research demonstrates that 100% utilization of the primary constraint is not optimal. It also shows that DBR responds well to relatively low levels of increased capacity at the operation's second most heavily utilized resource. This research also highlights several other issues related to capacity utilization that need further investigation.

When a cyclic schedule is employed, the throughput is determined by a cyclic sequence of operations known as the cyclic critical path. These operations are not, in general, all performed on a single bottleneck machine. We present an algorithm for releasing jobs that treats this cyclic critical path as the bottleneck. Although this algorithm has the somewhat complex task of not delaying any of these operations on the cyclic critical path, it is greatly simplified by being able to take advantage of the fixed sequence of the cyclic schedule. The result is that the algorithm is relatively simple to implement. Although it uses a simulation-based analysis, this analysis can all be done and the necessary results stored in advance of its use. We test the algorithm in a job shop environment with stochastic operation times. This algorithm is shown to be effective at reducing inventory while avoiding decreases in throughput.

Some researchers call for plants to focus on a single manufacturing capability and devote their limited resources accordingly, while others claim that advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) enables concurrent improvements in quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery. Yet there is little empirical evidence for or. against the trade-off model. In response, this study addresses the question: "To what extent do manufacturing plants view competitive priorities as trade-offs?" We employ survey data collected from managers and operators in 110 plants that have recently implemented AMT. Our findings suggest that trade-offs remain. However, perceived differences in competitive priorities are subtle and may vary across levels of the plant hierarchy.

Moreover, the combination of fast growth and the excitement associated with leading edge technologies has made New Economy companies magnets for management talent-and particularly for the ambitious young people who attend our management programs. Are we providing these potential managers with a good foundation for managing operations in such companies? Are the principles that we traditionally have taught in operations management (oM) courses sufficiently robust that they can still be applied to New Economy operations? In this paper we argue that, although some of our familiar concepts and techniques continue to be applicable to information-intensive operations, many are not. We sketch out a way to think conceptually about the important differences between the Old and the New Economies, and their implications for operations management teaching and research.

The experiment had as its treatment the adoption, at a single point in time, of a comprehensive enterprise information system throughout the functional groups charged with customer order fulfillment. This information technology (IT) adoption was not accompanied by substantial contemporaneous business process changes. Immediately after adoption, lead time and on-time delivery performance suffered, causing a "performance dip" similar to those observed after the introduction of capital equipment onto shop floors. Lead times and on-time delivery percentages then improved along a learning curve. After several months, performance in these areas improved significantly relative to preadoption levels. These observed performance patterns could not be well explained by rival causal factors such as order, production, and inventory volumes; head count; and new product introductions. Thus, this longitudinal research presents initial evidence of a causal link between IT adoption and subsequent improvement in operational performance measures, as well as evidence of the timescale over which these benefits appear.

To cope with this new structure, the firm created highly skilled generalists, "supply-chain integrators," who coordinate product development, marketing, production, and logistics from product concept to delivery across firm boundaries. We particularly focus on the skill-set that characterizes these integrators. Finally, we use the case evidence, combined with previous theory, to suggest a specific program of research into coordinating product development across disaggregated supply chains.

When the projects' delay costs differ, the problem (a "restless bandit") has not been solved in general. We consider the policy of working on the project with the highest expected delay loss as if the other project was completely finished first (although recourse is allowed). This policy is optimal if: (1) the delay cost increases with the delay regardless of the performance state, (2) costs are not discounted (or, discounting is dominated by delay costs), (3) projects are not abandoned based on their performance state during processing at the scarce resource, and (4) there are no stochastic delays. These assumptions are often fulfilled for processing at specialized resources, such as tests or one-off analyses.

Scheduling such a machine is interesting when the changeover times from one product to another are non-trivial-which is generally the case. This problem has a substantial literature, but the common practices of "lot-splitting" and "maximization of utilization" suggest that many practitioners still do not fully understand the principles of cyclic inventory. This paper is a tutorial that demonstrates those principles. We show that cyclic inventory is directly proportional to cycle length, which in turn is directly proportional to total changeover time, and inversely proportional to machine utilization. We demonstrate the virtue of "maximum changeover policies" in minimizing cyclic inventory-and the difficulty in making the transition to an increased level of demand. In so doing, we explicate the different roles of cyclic inventory, transitional inventory, and safety stock. We demonstrate the interdependence of the products in the cycle-the lot-size for one product cannot be set independently of the remaining products. We also give necessary conditions for consideration of improper schedules (i.e., where a product can appear more than once in the cycle), and demonstrate that both lot-splitting and maximization of utilization are devastatingly counter-productive when changeover time is non-trivial.

We develop four metrics using the principle that a volume flexible firm can handle similar levels of uncertainty (as measured by sales variability) with smaller fluctuations in inputs (as measured by variability in cost of goods sold and variability in inventory levels). Then, using 20 years of Compustat data on 550 firms in the capital goods industry, we find that on three of four process-based measures, small firms are more volume flexible. However, when we incorporate financial performance into our fourth metric, we find that large firms are more volume flexible. We conclude that, to be volume flexible is one thing, but to benefit from this flexibility, firms need to focus on the cost of being flexible.

Typical measures, already in place in more developed countries, include imposing riparian strips and protecting fragile soils from the use of heavy machinery. While environmental protection measures have been considered vital for decades, so far there has been almost no attempt to quantify both the benefits and costs of these measures. This paper attempts to measure the costs associated with the main measures which can help both the forestry firms and the government evaluate the cost impact of the new environmental protection regulations being studied. The analysis for different environmental scenarios is carried out by modifying a mixed integer LP, currently used for tactical planning by one forestry firm.

One productive use of hazardous wastes is to blend them into fuel, which mitigates damage to the environment by recycling waste into fuel and reducing fossil-fuel consumption. Operations personnel face a daunting task of efficiently blending hazardous waste into fuel, while simultaneously maintaining environmental regulatory requirements. This research develops a goal-programming approach to the waste-fuel-blending process that considers the diverse objectives of fuel managers. A real-world case study at a cement kiln illustrates the effectiveness of this approach, where the implementation followed principles of learn building and quality management.

That is, parts from the disassembly and repair of used products can be used to build "new" products. This is a problem common to many OEM remanufacturers, such as Xerox or Kodak. We study two main configurations, under the assumption that the disassembly sequence is exactly the reverse of the assembly sequence. Under a parallel configuration, there exist two separate dedicated lines, one for assembly and one for disassembly, which are decoupled by buffers-from both disassembly operations, which have preference, as well as parts from an outside, perfectly reliable supplier. Under a mixed configuration, the same station is used for both disassembly and assembly of a specific part. The problem is studied using G1/G/c networks, as well as simulation. Due to a loss of pooling, we conclude that the parallel configuration outperforms the mixed line only when the variability of both arrivals and processing time are significantly higher for disassembly and remanufacturing than for assembly. Via a simulation, we explore the impact of having advanced yield information for the remanufacturing parts. We find that advanced yield information generally improves flow times; however, there are some instances where it lengthens flow times.

However, managers must not only consider their own manufacturing operations in isolation, but also those of others along the supply chain. This paper explores two dimensions of supply chain activities-collaboration and evaluation-that might be leveraged by plant managers to improve environmental management in their own plant. The linkages with suppliers and customers were assessed. Both customer- and plant-initiated collaboration were found to have a significant effect on the level and form of investment in environmental technologies for a sample of Canadian plants. Of greatest importance, as customer-initiated collaborative activities increased, plant-level investment in environmental management was increasingly allocated toward pollution prevention. In contrast, only very limited evidence was found that evaluative activities influenced environmental investment.

For the latter, the decision is economically based; for the former, it is driven by other, more qualitative considerations.

In this article, we present one such formulation that is a market utility-based model for planning and scheduling in mass services (MUMS). MUMS is a holistic approach to market-based service capacity scheduling. The MUMS framework provides the structure for modeling the consequences of aligning competitive priorities and service attributes with an element of the firm's service infrastructure. We developed a new linear programming formulation for the shift-scheduling problem that uses market share information generated by customer preferences for service attributes. The shift-scheduling formulation within the framework of MUMS provides a business-level model that predicts the economic impact of the employee schedule. We illustrated the shift-scheduling model with empirical data, and then compared its results with models using service standard and productivity standard approaches. The result of the empirical analysis provides further justification for the development of the market-based approach. Last, we discuss implications of this methodology for future research.

In this article we reported on a case study from the telecommunication industry and aimed to analyze relevant root causes and associated countermeasures of the amplification phenomenon in service supply chains. Our case findings confirm the occurrence of upstream amplification of workload in the service supply chain, workload being a more appropriate measure for amplification effects in service supply chains than inventory levels. Not all of the root causes for amplification effects known from research in manufacturing environments were found to apply in this particular service context, especially those related to the use of inventory. In addition, our telecom case study highlighted a new root cause for amplification: interactions of high workloads and reduced process quality that start reinforcing each other once workloads pass a certain threshold. In this particular case, many of the known countermeasures to eliminate amplification did not apply, because of the specific characteristics of the service process, or yielded only limited results. A potentially very powerful countermeasure identified was to implement quality improvements throughout the service chain. This quality dimension links our research to the literature on service management in general, where service quality is on top of the research agenda.

First, we provide an economic framework to analyze the problem. Based on this framework we make a critical analysis of the objective functions used in the literature. We also question the validity of the assumption made throughout the literature that demand is exogenous and independent of customers' waiting times. We conclude that the objective functions used in the literature are appropriate only in the case of a central planner facing a demand that is unresponsive to waiting time. For other scenarios, such as a private server facing a demand that does react to waiting time, these objective functions are only shortcuts for the real objective functions that must be used. A more general model is then proposed that fits these scenarios well. Finally, we determine the impact of using the literature's objective functions on optimal appointment policies.

In particular, we focus on how exposure to Pos data may help reduce the "bullwhip effect," the tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a supply chain. Theoretical studies have shown that exposure to Pos data can lead to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers have no prior knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing Pos data in stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We find, using a controlled simulation experiment, that sharing Pos information does help reduce some components of the bullwhip effect in a stable demand setting, namely the order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one possible explanation for this improvement by examining the relationship between order decisions and demand line information.

Pooling can be accomplished through the reduction of the number of products or stock-keeping units (SKUs), through postponement of differentiation, or in other ways. These approaches are well known and becoming widely applied in practice. However, theoretical analyses of the pooling effect assume an optimal inventory policy before pooling and after pooling, and, in most cases, that demand is normally distributed. In this article, we address the effect of nonoptimal inventory policies and the effect of nonnormally distributed demand on the value of pooling. First, we show that there is always a range of current inventory levels within which pooling is better and beyond which optimizing inventory policy is better. We also find that the value of pooling may be negative when the inventory policy in use is suboptimal. Second, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulation to examine the value of pooling for nonnormal demand distributions. We find that the value of pooling varies relatively little across the distributions we used, but that it varies considerably with the concentration of uncertainty. We also find that the ranges within which pooling is preferred over optimizing inventory policy generally are quite wide but vary considerably across distributions. Together, this indicates that the value of pooling under an optimal inventory policy is robust across distributions, but that its sensitivity to suboptimal policies is not. Third, we use a set of real (and highly erratic) demand data to analyze the benefits of pooling under optimal and suboptimal policies and nonnormal demand with a high number of SKUs. With our specific but highly nonnormal demand data, we find that pooling is beneficial and robust to suboptimal policies. Altogether, this study provides deeper theoretical, numerical, and empirical understanding of the value of pooling.

With demand forecast updates, we develop a model where raw materials are ordered from two suppliers-one fast but expensive and the other cheap but slow-and further provide an explicit solution to the resulting dynamic optimization problem. Under some mild conditions, we demonstrate that the cost function is convex and twice-differentiable with respect to order quantity. With this model, we are able to evaluate the benefit of demand information updating which leads to the identification of directions for further improvement. We further demonstrate that the model applies to multiple-period problems provided that some demand regularity conditions are satisfied. Data collected from a manufacturer support the structure and conclusion of the model. Although the model is described in the context of in-bound logistics, it can be applied to production and out-bound logistics decisions as well.

The standard and widely used staffing method, which we call the stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach, divides the workday into planning periods and uses a series of stationary independent Erlang-c queuing models-one for each planning period-to estimate minimum staffing needs. Our research evaluates and improves upon this commonly used heuristic for those telephone call centers with limited hours of operation during the workday. We show that the SIPP approach often suggests staffing that is substantially too low to achieve the targeted customer service levels (probability of customer delay) during critical periods. The major reasons for SIPP's shortfall are as follows: (1) SIPP's failure to account for the time tag between the peak in customer demand and when system congestion actually peaks; and (2) SIPP's use of the planning period average arrival rate, thereby assuming that the arrival rate is constant during the period. We identify specific domains for which SIPP tends to suggest inadequate staffing. Based on an analysis of the factors that influence the magnitude of the lag in infinite server systems that start empty and idle, we propose and test two simple "lagged" sipp modifications that, in most situations, consistently achieve the service target with only modest increases in staffing.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the proposed framework is presented along with empirical data to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. The paper concludes with an agenda for further research.

In this paper, I first provide a framework for managerial decisions about variety. Variety-creation decisions determine the amount, type, and timing of end-product variety, while variety-implementation decisions focus on the design and operation of internal processes and a supply chain to support a firm's variety-creation strategy. I organize variety-related decisions into four key decision themes in variety creation: 1) dimensions of variety, 2) product architecture, 3) degree of customization, and 4) timing; and three key decision themes in variety implementation: 1) process capabilities, 2) points of variegation, and 3) day-to-day decisions. I describe each theme and review the relevant literature on each theme, with a focus on research that provides insight to problems faced in practice. Finally, I identify untapped avenues for future research that would be of value to the practicing manager, paying special attention to interdependencies among decision themes.

The proposed model maximizes the firm's expected profit under the condition of the uncertainty in technological progress and development. To solve this large-scale problem, we decompose future uncertainties through scenarios and then develop an algorithm to solve the resulting non-linear subproblems efficiently. Finally, we develop a heuristic to eliminate the infeasibility in the master problem and obtain best solutions. Numerical results show that our heuristic solutions are very close to the optimal solutions and meaningful insights are derived.

In this context, the existing literature on capacity expansion is limited because it does not consider the lead time required to construct and operationalize new capacity.

Analytic and numerical results show that the optimal solution can be significantly affected by the explicit treatment of the lead time and learning.

The proposed process model is comprised of a set of entities representing the e-service system, a network defining the linking between all pairs of entities via transactions and product flows, and a set of outcomes of the processes in terms of quality dimensions. The process model is developed using Unified Modeling Language (UML), a pictorial language for specifying service designs that has achieved widespread acceptance among e-service designers. Examples of applications of the process model are presented to illustrate how the model can be use to identify operational levers for managing and improving e-service quality.

Unfortunately, existing research has been limited in providing information to support prescriptive approaches for applying specific service recovery techniques. By using data from a large sample (n = 861) of service failure incidents and employing the use of hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis, this exploratory study creates and analyzes empirical types of service failures. The derived failure types, or common situations faced by service providers, focus on customer loyalty and the severity of the failure, and may be visualized in a two-by-two matrix. Regression analysis is then used to demonstrate how effective recovery strategies and supporting activities should vary, based on the location of the failure within the matrix. The approach and results offer important implications for strategy and service support activities as well as a foundation for systematizing service recovery efforts.

They then must attempt to modify the planned work schedule to improve service and increase profitability. This study, which defines such a setting as the real-time work schedule adjustment decision, proposes mathematical formulations of the real-time adjustment and develops efficient heuristic approaches for this decision. The study evaluates the relative effectiveness of these heuristics versus experienced service managers, investigates the effect of the degree of schedule adjustment on profitability, and assesses the effect of demand forecast update errors on the performance of the schedule adjustment efforts. First, the results indicate that the computer based heuristics achieve higher profit improvement than experienced managers. Second, there is a trade-off between schedule stability and profitability so that more extensive schedule revisions (efficiency first heuristics) generally result in higher profitability. However, the incremental return on schedule changes is diminishing. Third, we find that active adjustments of work schedules are beneficial as long as the direction of demand change is accurately identified.

We test the accuracy of the simulation by verifying the results in Chen et al. (2000a) and Dejonckheere et al. (2004). We find that lead-time variability exacerbates variance amplification in a supply chain, and that information sharing and information quality are highly significant. For example, using the assumptions in Chen et al. (2000a) and Dejonckheere et al. (2004), we find in a numerical experiment of a customer-retailer-wholesaler-distributor-factory supply chain that variance amplification is attenuated by nearly 50 percent at the factory due to information sharing. Other assumptions we make are based on interviews or conversations with managers at large supply chains.

Using path analysis, we model and test the relationships among the generic competitive capability constructs of conformance quality, delivery reliability, volume flexibility, and low cost as predicted by CPT. Our results, drawn from a sample of high-tech manufacturers, provide further evidence that on average, these four capabilities are acquired both cumulatively and in that sequence. We also find that each generic capability increases operational know-how and reduces non-value-added directly and/or indirectly through the enhancement of successive capabilities in the progression, which in turn improves profitability. The paper contributes a theoretical rationale for the observed sand cone effect, describes how the competitive progression acts to influence accelerated organizational learning over an innovation cycle, and offers evidence that combinative capabilities have strategic value for high-tech manufacturers.

Two dimensions of environmental dynamism are identified and the fit between them and different approaches to flexibility are assessed. Hierarchical regressions provide evidence that flexibility is a stronger predictor of performance in more dynamic environments. Specifically, presence of the unpredictability or the volatility aspects of environmental dynamism each warrant the use of different types of manufacturing flexibility strategies. Statistical results are interpreted with the caveat that while implemented capability must be used to study performance effects, this study uses perceived importance scales for flexibility.

The issue of cost containment in system maintenance is a critical factor for continued operation. Satellite finite life-times follow a stochastic process, and since satellite replenishment cost is the most significant on-going cost of operation, finding optimal launch policies is of paramount importance. This paper formulates the satellite launch problem as a Markovian decision model that can be solved using dynamic programming. The policy space of the system is enormous and traditional action space dominance rules do not apply. In order to solve the dynamic program for realistic problem sizes, a novel procedure for limiting the state space considered in the dynamic program is developed. The viability of the proposed solution procedure is demonstrated in example problems using realistic system data. The policies derived by the proposed solution procedure are superior to those currently considered by LEO system operators, and result in substantial annual cost savings.

In addition, real-world strategic planning issues of flexibility and preference detail are explored.

We examine whether rational efficiency (expressed by expected performance benefits and access to new markets), the bandwagon effect (expressed by external pressure), and barriers (both internal and customer related) influence Internet use for transactions (e-transactions) and/or to extend the relationships between service providers and their customers (e-CRM). The findings, based on a sample of 338 service firms, show that rational efficiency and the bandwagon effect drive both types of e-processes. Conversely, only internal barriers have a negative impact on adoption of e-processes, while barriers related to customers do not have a significant impact. These findings have important academic and managerial implications, given the limited evidence regarding the implementation of e-processes in services.

The first factor, considering the common elements of the two standards, points to conditions of infrastructural convenience, while the second highlights the importance of political-economic considerations.

The intent of this study was to identify factors that had arrested continued implementation of cells at surveyed manufacturing plants. We found no dominant factor that had prevented the firms from continued cellularization. However, by sub-dividing the plants into those with low and high degrees of direct labor hours spent in cells, short and long experience with cells, and those with and without plans for further cells, a clearer pattern emerged. The inability to find families with high and stable demand, lack of time to implement more cells, the existence of service processes, and the difficulty of cost justifying new cells were the most important factors, although their relative importance varied. The findings support the notion that cellular manufacturing has broad applicability as a form of work organization and that cell users pursue further implementations until no more viable cells with sufficient utilization, demand stability, or economic value can be found.

The 10 major airlines are separated into 2 groups for analysis: geographic specialists and geographic generalists. Our analysis shows that better Performing airlines (in terms of cost-quality position) in both groups confirm the predictions of the sand cone model when operating further away from their asset frontiers, although trade-offs do occur when operating close to asset frontiers.

We take up this issue and begin with defining a coordinating contract as one that results in a Pareto-optimal solution acceptable to each agent. Our definition generalizes the standard one in the risk-neutral case. We then develop coordinating contracts in three specific cases: (i) the supplier is risk neutral and the retailer maximizes his expected profit subject to a downside risk constraint; (ii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own mean-variance trade-off; and (iii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own expected utility. Moreover, in case (iii), we show that our contract yields the Nash Bargaining solution. In each case, we show how we can find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions, and then design a contract to achieve the solutions. We also exhibit a case in which we obtain Pareto-optimal sharing rules explicitly, and outline a procedure to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions.

The fundamental differential delay equations for a retailer's inventory reacting to a surge in demand are solved exactly. Much of the rich and complex inventory behavior is determined by the replenishment delay. The analytical solutions agree with numerical integrations and previous control theory results. Managerially useful ordering strategies are proposed. Exact expressions are derived for the retailer's orders to the manufacturer, and the Bullwhip Effect arises naturally. The approach is quite general and applicable to a wide variety of supply chain problems.

However, suppliers face different sets of costs and risks in open market and in electronic market. Consequently, suppliers participating in an electronic market are likely to offer their capacity at a different price compared with traditional open market. We analyze this problem and derive the price-capacity function for the supplier. We also derive a basis for allocating buyer's requirements among multiple suppliers so as to minimize his cost. Our model shows that suppliers with large capacities would quote a lower price in the electronic market. It also predicts that the unit bid price increases with bid quantity in the electronic market. Based on the price-capacity curve, we model a scenario where the buyer announces, a priori, the number of suppliers to be selected for award of a contract that will minimize its costs.

This, however, would mean continual variations in production quantities, and component orders from suppliers. A flexible manufacturing system can help alleviate costs related to modification of production quantities. The capacity of such a system, however, has to be limited because of high investment cost. Further, unless there is a long-term relationship, suppliers may levy a high surcharge for last minute changes in order size. We model a hybrid control policy comprising an advance (pre-production) order size agreed upon with suppliers, and a provision for real-time order revision at a given rate of surcharge. We show that a rank-order of products can be used for real-time revisions, and that a strong buyer-supplier relationship that keeps these surcharges low can actually help increase profits for both parties. We study issues such as compatibility between JIT and flexibility, and the impact of market conditions on overall profitability.

Product plant networks offer the benefits of consolidated production and reduced transshipment costs; on the other hand, process plant networks allow intensive dedication to process expertise and economics of scale. In this paper, we show that, aside from these benefits, process plant networks offer significant risk pooling advantages under a wide range of conditions. We analytically demonstrate that, even without accounting for economics of scale advantages, firms may prefer the process plant network configuration due to the risk pooling benefits offered.

In the uncoordinated scenario, individual members of both supply chains maximize their own profits by individually selecting their service and inventory policies. In the coordinated scenario, wholesalers and retailers of each supply chain coordinate their service and inventory policy decisions to maximize supply chain profits. In the hybrid scenario, competition is between one coordinated and one uncoordinated supply chain. We discuss the derivation of the equilibrium service strategies, resulting inventory policies, and profits for each scenario, and compare the equilibria in a numerical study. We find that coordination is a dominant strategy for both supply chains, but as in the prisoner's dilemma, both supply chains are often worse off under the coordinated scenario relative to the uncoordinated scenario. The consumers are the only guaranteed beneficiaries of coordination.

We investigate two very distinct types of arrangements between an assembler/retailer and its suppliers. One scheme is a vendor-managed inventory with revenue sharing, and the other a wholesale-price driven contract. In the VMI case, each supplier faces strategic uncertainty as to the amounts of components, which need to be mated with its own, that other suppliers will deliver. We explore the resulting components' delivery quantities equilibrium in this decentralized supply chain and its implications for participants' and system's expected profits. We derive the revenue shares the assembler should select in order to maximize its own profits. We then explore a revenue-plus-surplus-subsidy incentive scheme, where, in addition to a share of revenue, the assembler also provides a subsidy to component suppliers for their unsold components. We show that, by using this two-parameter contract, the assembler can achieve channel coordination and increase the profits of all parties involved. We then explore a wholesale-price-driven scheme, both as a single lever and in combination with buybacks. The channel performance of a wholesale-price-only scheme is shown to degrade with the number of suppliers, which is not the case with a revenue-share-only contract.

In the first strategy, the firm does not pass along the discount to its customers (sales subsidiaries); the firm simply coordinates purchasing and production among the different factories to take advantage of this one-time price discount. In the second strategy, the firm offers price discounts for its most profitable products in different sales subsidiaries to increase their demand. We carried out experiments for the two strategies based on a mathematical programming model, built around Toshiba's global notebook supply chain. Model constraints include, among others, material constraints, bill-of-materials, capacity and transportation constraints, minimum lot size constraints, and a constraint on minimum fill rate (service level constraint). Unlike most models of this type in the literature, which define variables in terms of single arc flows, we employ path variables, which allow for direct identification and manipulation of profitable and non-profitable products.

When the retailer stocks out of a particular item, customers who prefer the item are likely, with some probability, to switch to a substitute product from another manufacturer at the same store. In such an event, a "lost sale" for the manufacturer is not a "lost sale" for the retailer. This exacerbates differences in manufacturer's and retailer's stockout costs for the item. Such differences in stockout cost influence the optimal contract between the manufacturer and the retailer and also impose agency costs on the channel. Such contracts, in turn, determine equilibrium inventory levels and fill rates. We study these issues in a single-period supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, under three different scenarios (when the two firms are integrated into a single entity, when the retailer makes stocking decisions, and when the manufacturer makes stocking decisions). We compare, and present a methodology for comparing, stocking quantities, manufacturer efforts, and supply chain profits across different scenarios. We find that VMI performs better when manufacturer effort is a substantial driver of consumer demand and when consumers are unlikely to substitute to another brand in case of a stockout. On the other hand, if non-contractible manufacturer effort is unimportant, or when substitution is significant, VMI can exacerbate, rather than mitigate, channel inefficiencies, and can perform worse than traditional Retailer Managed Inventory.

The primary objective of this research is to test, under a variety of environmental conditions, the effectiveness of quantity discounts as an inventory coordination mechanism between a buyer and a supplier. A comprehensive simulation experiment with ANOVA has been designed to investigate the impacts of (1) choice of quantity discount-based inventory coordination policies, (2) magnitude of demand variation, (3) buyer's and supplier's relative inventory cost structure, and (4) buyer's economic time-between-orders on the effectiveness of supply chain inventory coordination. The analytical results confirm that the quantity discount policies have managerial properties as a mediator for inventory coordination. The results also show that the performance of quantity discount-based inventory coordination policies is influenced significantly by environmental factors, such as the magnitude of demand variation, the buyer's and the supplier's inventory cost structure, and the buyer's economic time-between-orders.

Such a company may at once be both a supplier to and a direct competitor of any existing reseller partners (e.g., land-based retailers), which can result in "channel conflict." This can have momentous implications for distribution strategy. To generate managerial insights into this important issue, we develop a model that captures key attributes of such a setting, including various sources of inefficiency. We examine these in detail and identify a number of counterintuitive structural properties. For instance, the addition of a direct channel alongside a reseller channel is not necessarily detrimental to the reseller, given the associated adjustment in the manufacturer's pricing. In fact, both parties can benefit. Finally, we examine ways to adjust the manufacturer-reseller relationship that have been observed in industry. These include changes in wholesale pricing, paying the reseller a commission for diverting customers toward the direct channel, or conceding the demand fulfillment function entirely to the reseller. The latter two schemes could be mutually beneficial in that they achieve a division of labor according to each channel's competitive advantage.

In this model, no player has complete knowledge about all the costs and constraints of the other players. The decision-making framework employs an iterative procedure, based on the Integer L-shaped method, in which a master problem is solved to propose global solutions, and each player uses his local problems to construct feasibility and optimality cuts on the master problem. The master problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, and the players' local problems are formulated as linear programs. Collaborative planning scenarios in private e-marketplaces and in supply chains were formulated and solved for test data. The results show that this distributed model is able to achieve near-optimal solutions considerably faster than the traditional centralized approach.

The same product is assigned different price-points in different store panels and the resulting sales are used to estimate a demand curve. We use a variant of the k-median problem to form store panels that control for differences between stores and produce results that are representative of the entire chain. We use the estimated demand curve to find a price that maximizes profit. Our experiment yielded the unexpected result that demand increases with price in some cases. We present likely reasons for this finding from our discussions with retail managers. Our methodology can be used to analyze the effect of several marketing and promotional levers employed in a retail store besides pricing.

Companies follow various strategies ranging from equipment selection to order process management to cope with the challenges of increased customization. We examined how the customization process affects product performance and conformance in the context of a design-to-order (DTO) manufacturer of industrial components. Our competing risk hazard function model incorporates two thresholds, which we define as mismatch and manufacturing thresholds. Product performance was adversely affected when the degree of customization exceeded the mismatch threshold. Likewise, product conformance eroded when the degree of customization exceeded the manufacturing threshold. Relative sizes of the two thresholds have management implications for the subsequent investments to improve customization capabilities. Our research developed a rigorous framework to address two key questions relevant to the implementation of product customization: (1) what degrees of customization to offer, and (2) how to customize the product design process.

Increasingly, customers are favoring lead time guarantees as a means to hedge supply chain risks. For a make-to-order environment, we explicitly model the impact of a lead time guarantee on customer demands and production planning. We study how a firm can integrate demand and production decisions to optimize expected profits by quoting a uniform guaranteed maximum lead time to all customers. Our analysis highlights the increasing importance of lead time for customers, as well as the tradeoffs in achieving a proper balance between revenue and cost drivers associated with lead-time guarantees. We show that the optimal lead time has a closed-form solution with a newsvendor-like structure. We prove comparative statics results for the change in optimal lead time with changes in capacity and cost parameters and illustrate the insights using numerical experimentation.

We develop a diffusion and substitution model based on a somewhat different perspective. In some cases, progressive improvements in product attributes and/or continual cost reduction seem to be a key driver of the diffusion process. For example, after introduction of the 5.25-inch disk drive, its capacity continually increased, and accordingly, so did customer willingness-to-pay. Our model is based on a linear reservation price framework, in which a product is described by its depth (defined as the difference between a product's maximum reservation price and its production cost), and its breadth (related to the slope of its reservation price curve), indicating how broadly it appeals across various customer segments. Because of changes in product depths and breadths over time, customers who previously preferred the old product may later prefer the new product, thus creating the diffusion process. While the Bass model describes diffusion as a function of the coefficients of innovation and imitation, in our model, it is described by the coefficients of depth and breadth (the rates of change in relative depth and breadth), along with an S-coefficient that we associate with the technology S-curve. We fit our model to data from the disk-drive and the microprocessor industries.

The axiomatic decomposition for conceptual design method combines Alexander's network partitioning formulation of the design problem with Suh's Independence Axiom. The axiomatic decomposition method uses a cross-domain approach in a House of Quality context to estimate the interactions among the functional requirements that are derived from a qualitative assessment of customer requirements. These interactions are used in several objective functions that serve as criteria for decomposing the design network. A new network partitioning algorithm is effective in creating partitions that maximize the within-partition interactions and minimize the between-partition interactions with appropriate weightings. The viability, usability, and value of the axiomatic decomposition method were examined through analytic comparisons and qualitative assessments of its application. The new method was examined using students in engineering design capstone courses and it was found to be useable and did produce better product designs that met the customer requirements. The student-based assessment revealed that the process would be more effective with individuals having design experience, In a subsequent assessment with practicing industrial designers, it was found that the new method did facilitate the development of better designs. An important observation was the need for limits on partition size (maximum of four functional requirements.) Another issue identified for future research was the need for a means to identify the appropriate starting partition for initiating the design.

Before manufacturing can begin, either these Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), or a Contract Manufacturer (CM) needs to adopt the process technology, i.e., make a capacity investment in it. Due to market uncertainty, the timing of capacity investment is crucial. In such a setting, we investigate how the timing of process adoption, an important determinant of time-to-market, is impacted by the make/buy decision. We first characterize the optimal time for process adoption and show that this delay depends on competitive intensity, cost structure and the rate of forecast improvement. Due to differing cost structures, incentives and risks, an OEM and a CM may invest in a new process technology at different times. We show that while there are conditions where outsourced manufacturing can be advantageous for the OEM from a time-to-market perspective, there are also cases where the OEM would be disadvantaged. In these cases, the OEM can accelerate process adoption by risk sharing through joint investment. Finally, the right choice of CM is extremely important for an OEM that faces a short time window for product introduction: An efficient CM not only provides low costs but also rapid access to,new process technologies, and therefore higher revenues.

This issue, generally labeled the "make-buy" decision, has received substantial theoretical and empirical attention. In this paper, we broaden the scope of the make-buy decision to include product design decisions, as well as production decisions. First, we examine independently the decisions of whether to internalize design and production, and then we consider how design and production organizational decisions are interdependent. The specific research questions we address are: (1) How can design and production sourcing decisions be described in richer terms than "make" and "buy"? (2) Do existing theories of vertical integration apply to product design activities as well as production decisions? (3) What is the relationship between the organization of design and the organization of production? (4) What organizational forms for design and production are seen in practice? After developing theoretical arguments and a conceptual framework, we explore these ideas empirically through an analysis of design and production sourcing decisions for bicycle frames in the U.S. mountain bicycle industry.

In simultaneous processes, multiple parties must adapt to one another in real time as decisions evolve. For example, New Product Development (NPD) requires collaboration in the context of Concurrent Engineering, and Supply Chain Management (SCM) in the context of collaborative planning. In both cases, parties must modify decisions based on preliminary information, information that is not fully precise or stable, about what the other parties are doing. This article develops a generalized model of real-time decision making based on preliminary information, which applies both to NPD and SCM. The model offers insights into when to commit to a course of action, and we derive seven principles that help in dealing with preliminary information.

Yet, NPD management is becoming increasingly decentralized, both within the firm and across the supply chain. Hence, planning for NPD uncertainty often results in path-dependent scenarios cutting across the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of planning. To coordinate this resulting complexity, we propose a stochastic hierarchical product development planning framework with multiple recourses, i.e., corrective actions, to maximize performance across a firm's entire NPD program. We also argue the necessity for a fourth planning level, the infrastructural, that reestablishes norms for market projections, technological forecasts, scheduling, and requirements as latent uncertainty in the environment is continually revealed. An illustration from the automotive industry is presented to demonstrate a deployment of our framework. We additionally discuss the applicability of this framework for managing NPD capabilities over time.

Under fairly general assumptions, we find that there are three possible optimal actions: to abandon the project, to maintain the current technology, or to reposition so as to use the best technology currently available. We characterize the optimal positioning sequence in different design environments, discussing throughout the practical implications of our model. Previous research and conventional wisdom suggest early finalization of product specifications if design flexibility is decreasing over time. In contrast, we find that in some design environments, repositioning late in the development cycle can be optimal.

Among other factors, the rate of new product development is found to be associated with an industry's clockspeed. Yet the notion of an industry clockspeed and the essential factors driving suitable decision making in this area have remained relatively unexplored. We develop a simple definition and a corresponding analytic model which explains the interdependent relationship between a firm's own new product development activities and an industry clockspeed. Results from the single firm model show the conditions under which particular firms have an incentive to accelerate their new product development activities. Moreover, we link the single firm's NPD clockspeed decisions to the industry level by creating appropriate metrics; which characterize different types of industries. Examples from high-tech industries such as the personal computer and aerospace industries are included to illustrate our findings. Our intention is not only to offer analytical insights into factors driving the clockspeed for these industries, but also to establish a fundamental structured decision making approach, thereby stimulating future research on this important topic.

The framework consists of a three stage model for exploring the relationships between metrics used by design, manufacturing, marketing functions, and overall commercial success. Using a cross-sectional survey of 383 product development professionals working on 38 product development projects in the high-tech electronic assembled goods manufacturing sector, we provide empirical evidence of the proposed framework. The findings indicate that in the high-tech manufacturing sector (1) commercial success of new product development projects is primarily determined by market share, (2) gain in market share is primarily driven by lower unit cost and not by technical performance, and (3) reduction in unit cost is primarily driven by the increased speed of new product development and not by the R&D budget. The study failed to identify any significant association between R&D budget and technical performance, and development speed and technical performance.

The one-time strategic decision regarding the firm's investment in changeover flexibility establishes the link between market opportunities and manufacturing capabilities. Specifically, the optimal changeover flexibility decision is determined in the context of the firm's market entry strategy for successive product generations, the changeover cost between generations, and the production efficiency of the facility. Moreover, the dynamic pricing policy for each product generation is obtained as a function of the firm's market entry strategy and manufacturing efficiency. Our findings provide insights linking internal manufacturing capabilities with external market forces for the high-tech and high-volume manufacturer of products with short life cycles. We show the impact of manufacturing efficiency and a firm's ability to benefit from volume-based learning on the dynamic pricing policy for each product generation. The results demonstrate the benefits realized by a firm that works with its manufacturing equipment suppliers to develop more efficient and flexible technology. In addition, we explore how opportunities afforded by pioneer advantage enable a firm operating a less efficient facility to realize long term competitive advantage by deploying an earlier market entry strategy.

Motivated by our experience at a major U.S. semiconductor manufacturer, we model the capacity-allocation problem in a game-theoretic setting as follows: each product manager (PM) is responsible for a certain product line, while privately owning demand information through regular interaction with the customers. Capacity-allocation is carried out by the corporate headquarters (HQ), which allocates manufacturing capacity to product lines based on demand information reported by the PMs. We show that PMs have an incentive to manipulate demand information to increase their expected allocation, and that a carefully designed coordination mechanism is essential for HQ to implement the optimal allocation. To this end, we design an incentive scheme through bonus payments and participation charges that elicits private demand information from the PMs. We show that the mechanism achieves budget-balance and voluntary-participation requirements simultaneously. The results provide important insights into the treatment of misaligned incentives in the context of semiconductor capacity-allocation.

This research develops an empirical QM model in a technology-based sector-electronics manufacturing. Based on quantitative and qualitative investigations of 225 electronics firms in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China, a path analytic model is developed. The empirical model shows that a typical quality management system (QMS) in the electronics industry is composed of four major modules, namely leadership, cultural elements, operational support systems, and process management. These modules create a series of chain effects on organizational performance, rather than acting as parallel elements with an equal impact. By quantifying their effects on organizational performance and comparing the model to others in the literature, we identify those QM constructs that are context dependent. In electronics manufacturing, process management and customer focus are more important than other elements (e.g., cultural factors) for garnering business results. This study contributes to contingency theory and research by identifying the key constructs and their relationships in a competitive, volatile, and technology-based industry with complex supply networks.

Shigeo Shingo showed that radical reductions in setup times are possible in metal fabrication using an approach he called "Single Minute Exchange of Dies" (SMED). We applied SMED to setups of high speed circuit board assembly tools. Its key concepts were valid in this very different industry, but while SMED typically emphasizes process simplification, we had to add modern information technology tools including wireless terminals, barcodes, and a relational database. These tools shield operators from the inherent complexity of managing thousands of unique parts and feeders. The economic value of setup reduction is rarely calculated. We estimate a reduction of key setup times by more than 80%, and direct benefits of $1.8 million per year. Total cost of the changes was approximately $350,000.

In such an environment, the servers can either be specialists (or dedicated) who serve a specific customer type, or generalists (or flexible) who serve either type of customers. Cross-trained workers are more flexible and help reduce system delay, but also contribute to increased service costs and reduced service efficiency. Our objective is to provide insights into the choice of an optimal workforce mix of flexible and dedicated servers. We assume Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, and use matrix-analytic methods to investigate the impact of various system parameters such as the number of servers, server utilization, and server efficiency on the choice of server mix. We develop guidelines for managers that would help them to decide whether they should be either at one of the extremes, i.e., total flexibility or total specialization, or some combination. If it is the latter, we offer an analytical tool to optimize the server mix.

The supplier and the buyer are partners who enter a "design-win" agreement to develop the product, and who share the stochastic demand information. To encourage the supplier for more aggressive capacity expansion, the buyer reserves capacity upfront by paying a deductible fee. As capacity expansion demonstrates diseconomy of scale in this context, we assume convex capacity costs. We show that as the buyer's revenue margin decreases, the supplier faces a sequence of four profit scenarios with decreasing desirability. We examine the effects of market size and demand variability to the contract conditions. We propose two channel coordination contracts, and discuss how such contracts can be tailored for situations where the supplier has the option of not complying with the contract, and when the buyer's demand information is only partially updated during the supplier's capacity lead-time.

Under a tournament, a buyer initially procures her parts from two suppliers with possibly different quality levels, for T time periods, i.e., she parallel sources. During this time, the buyer is able to observe noisy signals about the suppliers' quality. At time T, she selects the supplier with the highest observed performance and awards it the remainder of her business. We characterize the optimal duration of the tournament as a function of various market parameters, including information and investment costs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a tournament can be more profitable for the buyer than selecting the highest quality supplier at time T = 0 and sole sourcing entirely.

Capacity decisions have an important effect on the project's value through the up-front investment, the associated operating cost, and constraints on output. However, increased scale also affects the financial risk of the project through its effect on the operating leverage of the investment. Although it has long been recognized in the finance literature that operating leverage affects project risk, this result has not been incorporated in the operations management literature when evaluating projects. We study the decision problem of a firm that must choose project scale. Future cash flow uncertainty is introduced by uncertain future market prices. The firm's capacity decision affects the firm's potential sales, its expected price for output, and its costs. We study the firm's profit maximizing scale decision using the CAPM model for risk adjustment. Our results include that project risk, as measured by the required rate of return, is related to the inverse of the expected profit per unit sold. We also show that project risk is related to the scale choice. In contrast, in traditional discounted cash flow analysis (DCF), a fixed prescribed rate is used to evaluate the project and choose its scale. When a fixed rate is used with DCF, a manager will ignore the effect of scale on risk and choose suboptimal capacity that reduces project value. S/he will also misestimate project value. Use of DCF for choosing scale is studied for two special cases. It is shown that if the manager is directed to use a prescribed discount rate that induces the optimal scale decision, then the manager will greatly undervalue the project. In contrast, if the discount rate is set to the risk of the optimally-scaled project, the manager will undersize the project by a small amount, and slightly undervalue the project with the economic impact of the error being small. These results underline the importance of understanding the source of financial risk in projects where risk is endogenous to the project design.

Stock price effects are examined starting one year before through two years after the disruption announcement date. Over this time period the average abnormal stock returns of firms that experienced disruptions is nearly -40%. Much of this underperformance is observed in the year before the announcement, the day of the announcement, and the year after the announcement. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that firms do not quickly recover from the negative effects of disruptions. The equity risk of the firm also increases significantly around the announcement date. The equity risk in the year after the announcement is 13.50% higher when compared to the equity risk in the year before the announcement.

The company follows a deterministic replenishment-and-planning process despite considerable demand uncertainty. As a possible way to formally address uncertainty, we provide two risk measures, "demand-at-risk" (DaR) and "inventory-at-risk" (IaR) and two linear programming models to help manage demand uncertainty. The first model is deterministic and can be used to allocate the replenishment schedule from the plants among the customers as per the existing process. The other model is stochastic and can be used to determine the "ideal" replenishment request from the plants under demand uncertainty. The gap between the output of the two models as regards requested replenishment and the values of the risk measures can be used by the company to reallocate capacity among different products and to thus manage demand /inventory risk.

We focus on a multi-period environment with convex contract, spot market, and inventory holding costs. We specialize the model to the case of a portfolio consisting of option contracts. We characterize the optimal replenishment policy and show that it has a simple structure. Namely, the use of every different option contract and the spot market is dictated by a modified base-stock policy. In addition, we derive conditions to determine when an option is relatively attractive compared to other options or the spot market. Finally, we present our computational study, where we report the sensitivity of the results to the parameters of the model. Our experiments indicate that portfolio contracts not only increase the manufacturer's expected profit, but can also reduce its financial risk.

When remanufacturing is feasible, the longer the return flows are delayed during the active (primary) market demand period of the product, the lower the value that can be recovered through these operations. In fact, in order to recover the highest value from remanufactured products, the collection rates, return timings, and reusability rates should be matched with the active market demand and supply. With these motivations, this paper is aimed at developing analytical models for the efficient use of returns in making production, inventory, and remanufacturing decisions during the active market. More specifically, we consider a stylistic setting where a collector collects used product returns and ships them to the manufacturer who, in turn, recovers value by remanufacturing and supplies products during the active market demand. Naturally, the manufacturer's production, inventory and remanufacturing decisions and costs are influenced by the timing and quantity of the collector's shipments of used product returns. Hence, we investigate the impact of the timing of returns on the profitability of the manufacturer-collector pair by developing system-wide cost optimization models. Analyzing the properties of the optimal shipment frequency, we observe that the fastest reverse supply chain may not always be the most efficient one.

For this economic lot scheduling problem with returns (ELSPR), we consider policies with a common cycle time for all products, and with one manufacturing lot and one remanufacturing lot for each product during a cycle. For a given cycle time, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MIP) problem, which provides the basis for an exact solution. The application of this model for one of the core products of the case study company indicates a 16% reduction in cost compared to the current lot scheduling policy.

The remanufactured product, which is a cheaper substitute for the new product, is often put on the market during the life cycle of the new product and affects its sales dynamics. In this paper, we study the integrated dynamic management of a portfolio of new and remanufactured products that progressively penetrate a potential market over the product life cycle. To this end, we extend the Bass diffusion model in a way that maintains the two essential features of remanufacturing settings: (a) substitution between new and remanufactured products, and (b) a constraint on the diffusion of remanufactured products due to the limited supply of used products that can be remanufactured. We identify characteristics of the diffusion paths of new and remanufactured products. Finally, we analyze the impact of levers such as remanufacturability level, capacity profile and reverse channel speed on profitability.

Therefore, capacity planning becomes a strategic issue of major importance for the profitability of closed-loop supply chains. This work studies a closed-loop supply chain with remanufacturing and presents dynamic capacity planning policies developed through the methodology of System Dynamics. The key issue of the paper is how the lifecycles and return patterns of various products affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The model can be used to identify effective policies, to conduct various "what-if" analyses, and to answer questions about the long-term profitability of reverse supply chains with remanufacturing. The results of numerical examples with quite different lifecycle and return patterns show how the optimal collection expansion/contraction and remanufacturing contraction policies depend on the lifecycle type and the average usage time of the product, while the remanufacturing capacity expansion policy is not significantly affected by these factors. The results also show that the collection and remanufacturing capacity policies are insensitive to the total product demand. The insensitivity of the optimal policies to total demand is a particularly appealing feature of the proposed model, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate demand forecasts.

This can be a challenge due to the inherent variability in the condition and amount of returns, which has a direct impact on remanufacturing costs and leadtimes. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to compare two alternative strategies that use either manufacturing or remanufacturing as the primary means of satisfying customer demand. Of course, in the event that the demand cannot be met by the prioritized process, the secondary process is used as a contingency. In our basic model, the priority decisions are made at the component level in replenishing the serviceable inventory, while the disposal and new component ordering decisions are made independently. The second model represents the coordination of remanufacturable and new component inventory control decisions. Using simulation-based optimization on a large number of experiments, we observe that when prioritization is in the upstream echelon and there is no coordination in managing component stocks, there exists a critical return ratio, below which it is beneficial to give priority to manufacturing and above which it is beneficial to give priority to remanufacturing. We also see that coordinated control of the component inventories considerably reduces the importance of prioritization. These observations remain valid when congestion in the shop floor is also taken into account. We also study the benefits of state-dependent dispatching policies in a realistic case.

In many cases, firms choose not to remanufacture, as they are (rightly) concerned that the remanufactured product will cannibalize sales of the higher-margin new product. However, such a strategy may backfire for manufacturers operating in industries where their end-of-life products (cell phones, tires, computers, automotive parts, etc.) are attractive to third-party remanufacturers, who may seriously cannibalize sales of the original manufacturer. In this paper, we develop models to support a manufacturer's recovery strategy in the face of a competitive threat on the remanufactured product market. We first analyze the competition between new and remanufactured products produced by a monopolist manufacturer and identify conditions under which the firm would choose not to remanufacture its products. We then characterize the potential profit loss due to external remanufacturing competition and analyze two entry-deterrent strategies: remanufacturing and preemptive collection. We find that a firm may choose to remanufacture or preemptively collect its used products to deter entry, even when the firm would not have chosen to do so under a pure monopoly environment. Finally, we discuss conditions under which each strategy is more beneficial.

The price set for the refurbished products affects the demands for both new and refurbished products, while the refurbishment and resale activities incur costs. To maximize profit, a manufacturer in a competitive market must carefully choose the proportion of returned products to refurbish and their sale price. We model the sale, return, refurbishment, and resale processes in an open queueing network and formulate a mathematical program to find the optimal price and proportion to refurbish. Examination of the optimality conditions reveals the different situations in which it is optimal to refurbish none, some, or all of the returned products. Refurbishing operations may increase profit or may be required to relieve a manufacturing capacity bottleneck. A numerical study identifies characteristics of the new product market and refurbished products that encourage refurbishing and some situations in which small changes in the refurbishing cost and quality provoke large changes in the optimal policy.

Sorting policies-the rules specifying which used products should be remanufactured and which should be scrapped-have received limited attention in the literature. In this paper, we examine the case of a remanufacturer who acquires unsorted used products as needed from third party brokers. As more used items are acquired for a given demand, the remanufacturer can be more selective when sorting. Thus, two related decisions are made: how many used items to acquire, and how selective to be during the sorting process. We derive optimal acquisition and sorting policies in the presence of used product condition variability for a remanufacturer facing both deterministic and uncertain demand. We show the existence of a single optimal acquisition and sorting policy with a simple structure and show that this policy is independent of production amount when acquisition costs are linear.

We start with a single period model with normally distributed demands and returns, and restrict the analysis to the value of full information (VOFI) on one or more types of uncertainty. We develop estimators that are predictive of the value and sensitivity of (combinations of) different information types. We find that there is no dominance in value amongst the different types of information, and that there is an additional pay-off from investing in more than one type. We then extend our analysis to the multi-period case, where returns in a period are correlated with demands in the previous period, and study the value of partial information (VOPI) as well as full information. We demonstrate that our results from the single period model (adapted for VOPI) carry-over exactly. Furthermore, a comparison with uniformly distributed demand and return show that these results are robust with respect to distributional assumptions.

Motivated by the automotive parts remanufacturing industry, we consider an end-of-life product from which a particular part can be recovered and remanufactured for reuse, and the remainder of the product can be recycled for material recovery. Both the supply of end-of-life products and demand for remanufactured parts are price-sensitive. Yield of the recovery process is random and depends on the acquisition price offered for the end-of-life products. In this setting, we develop models to determine the optimal acquisition price for the end-of-life products and the selling price for remanufactured parts. We also analyze the effects of yield variation to the profitability of remanufacturing, benefits of delaying pricing decisions until after yield realization, and value of perfect yield rate information.

Specifically, we determine the optimal order quantity by the retailer for four systems of decision-making: (a) the three firms make their decisions in a coordinated fashion, (b) the retailer acts independently while the manufacturer and remanufacturer coordinate their decisions, (c) the remanufacturer acts independently while the retailer and manufacturer coordinate their decisions, and (d) all three firms act independently. We model the four options described above as centralized or decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and provide insights into the optimal order quantities. Coordination mechanisms are then provided which enable the different players to achieve jointly the equivalent profits in a coordinated channel.

We also assess the diversity of articles in terms of the purposes of research, data collection approaches, and data analysis techniques. We classify the empirical research articles based on their primary purpose (theory building, theory verifying, application, and providing evidence), data collection approach (case study, qualitative research, archival research, survey-based research, laboratory research, and field research), data analysis technique (descriptive statistics, various multivariate statistical techniques, and mathematical modeling), and operations topics (strategy, quality, and supply chain management). We also discuss directions for future empirical research in operations management. During 1992 to 2005, the articles based on empirical data have increased substantially from 30 to 50 percent of all articles published in POM. During 1992 to 1998, about three-fourths of the empirical-research-based articles published in POM focused on the manufacturing industry, but recently the gap between the numbers of manufacturing- and service-focused articles published in POM has almost disappeared. While a previous assessment of articles published in a range of operations management journals showed that almost all of the empirical articles were based on either surveys or case studies, our results indicate that POM has published articles that were based on a much wider and more diverse range of data collection approaches. Production and Operations Management has clearly established itself as a leading outlet for publishing empirical research in operations management.

We first investigate three special cases. The first is an existing model of price and delivery time differentiation with exogenous reliabilities, which we only review. The second focuses on time-based (i.e., length and reliability) differentiation with exogenous prices. The third deals with deciding on all features for an express variant when a regular product already exists in the marketplace. We subsequently address the integrative framework of time-and-price-based differentiation for both products in a numerical study. Our results shed light on the role that customer preferences towards delivery times, reliabilities and prices, and the capacity costs (absolute and relative) have on the firm's optimal product positioning policy.

However, the impact on revenue of poor capacity and flexibility decisions can be mitigated by appropriately changing prices. While investment decisions need to be made years before demand is realized, pricing decisions can easily be postponed until product launch, when more accurate demand information is available. We study the effect of this price decision delay on the optimal investments on dedicated and flexible capacity. Computational experiments show that considering price postponement at the planning stage leads to a large reduction in capacity investments, especially in the more expensive flexible capacity, and a significant increase in profits. Its impact depends on demand correlation, elasticity and diversion, ratio of fixed to variable capacity costs, and uncertainty remaining at the times the pricing and production decisions are made.

Finally, managerial implications at both the corporate as well as manufacturing unit levels are discussed.

This study controlled for industry by investigating the online home delivery grocery business, and an analysis of 1,919 customers of home delivery grocers identified four groups of online customers based on reasons for selecting this service. These four groups were next linked to operational execution in terms of service, product, and Internet quality, and found to vary in predicable ways. Subsequent to the initial data collection, five month's of post hoc longitudinal purchasing history was collected on the four groups of online customers to determine the relative profitability. Finally, as a follow-on analysis, the study used regression to predict future consumer purchases based upon operational execution. Time savings and service quality emerged as the two most important independent variables in terms of future buying from such online home delivery services.

The manufacturer and the distributor each has an ideal schedule, determined by cost and capacity considerations. However, these two schedules are in general not well coordinated, which leads to poor overall performance. In this context, we study two practical problems. In both problems, the manufacturer focuses on minimizing unproductive time. The distributor minimizes customer cost measures in the first problem and minimizes inventory holding cost in the second problem. We first evaluate each party's conflict, which is the relative increase in cost that results from using the other party's optimal schedule. Since this conflict is often significant, we consider several practical scenarios about the level of cooperation between the manufacturer and the distributor. These scenarios define various scheduling problems for the manufacturer, the distributor, and the overall system. For each of these scheduling problems, we provide an algorithm. We demonstrate that the cost saving provided by cooperation between the decision makers is usually significant. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work for how manufacturers and distributors negotiate, coordinate, and implement their supply chain schedules in practice.

Each stage holds no finished goods inventory, but rather only backlogs that can be managed by adjusting staffing levels. We develop optimal control policies to balance backlog costs against hiring and firing personnel costs-assuming shared backlog information-under both centralized and decentralized control. We examine when there is sufficient economic incentive for two completely decentralized stages to begin: (1) to share backlog information without centralizing control, or (2) to completely centralize control. These switching points are determined by the relative service and personnel costs of the two stages. From these results, we show that decentralizing control in many cases does not materially worsen performance, so long as information is shared. Moreover, in some cases, even sharing information is of only marginal benefit.

The approach involves the development of an adjusted discounted cycle cost formula, which has an appealing intuitive interpretation. We show for the first time that an (s, S) policy is optimal in the case of demand having a compound Poisson component as well as a constant rate component. Our demand structure simultaneously generalizes the classical EOQ model and the inventory models with Poisson demand, and we indicate the reasons why this task has been a difficult one. We do not require the surplus cost function to be convex or quasi-convex as has been assumed in the literature. Finally, we show that the optimal s is unique, but we do not know if optimal S is unique.

The contributions include insights as to how beta* is influenced by system parameters, and the determination of simple closed form beta* estimates. The latter offering a practical means to achieve coordinated control of large size systems.

By contrast, cells with a dual gripper robot, although more productive, have so far received scant attention, perhaps due to their inherent complexity. We consider the problem of scheduling operations in dual gripper robotic cells that produce identical parts. The objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-rain average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. We provide a structural analysis of cells with one or more machines per processing stage to obtain first a lower bound on the throughput and, subsequently, an optimal solution under conditions that are common in practice. We illustrate our analysis on two, cells implemented at a semiconductor equipment manufacturer and offer managerial insights for assessing the potential productivity gains from the use of dual gripper robots.

Such definitions inadequately identify managerial and operational implications common among, and unique to, services. We present a "Unified Services Theory" (UST) to clearly delineate service processes from non-service processes and to identify key commonalities across seemingly disparate service businesses. The UST defines a service production process as one that relies on customer inputs; customers act as suppliers for all service processes. Non-services (such as make-to-stock manufacturing) rely on customer selection of outputs, payment for outputs, and occasional feedback, but production is not dependent upon inputs from individual customers. The UST reveals principles that are common to the wide range of services and provides a unifying foundation for various theories and models of service operations, such as the traditional "characteristics of services" and Customer Contact Theory. The UST has significant operational corollaries pertaining to capacity and demand management, service quality, services strategy, and so forth. The UST provides a common reference point to which services management researchers can anchor future theory-building and theory-testing research.

Codifying tacit know-how helps, but codification becomes more challenging as the know-how changes more frequently. Transfer of tacit know-how becomes much more complicated when it changes often. We need more research in this area, particularly to help production and operations managers who must ultimately use the new know-how and change their companies' production processes. The paper suggests a framework as a step in that direction. The framework focuses on the interplay between the level of codification and the rate of change of production know-how, and identifies four zones for classifying production know-how: "slow and codified," "slow and tacit," "fast and codified," and "fast and tacit." Examples from McDonald's, Club Med, Intel, and AOL are used to illustrate primary transfer mechanisms for each zone (manuals and systems, people, joint-development, and projects, respectively). Appropriate absorptive capacities in the production units for each zone are also identified. Since the ultimate responsibility of operations managers is to improve (i.e., change) their production know-how as fast as possible, they would be wise to adopt policies that are closer to those suited for the "fast and codified" zone. Intel and Toyota show good models.

However, evidence supporting this proposition is anecdotal. This paper examines the impact of product customisation on four competitive priorities, drawing upon the results of a recent survey of 102 U.K. manufacturing firms from eight industry sectors. The study indicates significant compatibility between customisation and quality, volume flexibility, delivery reliability and non-manufacturing costs. On the other hand, trade-offs remain between customisation and manufacturing costs and delivery lead times. The results contradict the initial proposition that customisation can be "free," and have important implications for firms embarking upon a mass customisation strategy.

We analyze the effect of contract leadership (i.e., the ability to offer wholesale price and two-part tariff contracts) on supply chain performance and use that as a basis to study coordination and cooperation. There is strong evidence of first-mover advantage in wholesale price contracting which is amplified when the chain is coordinated using two-part tariff contracts. We analyze cooperation and the implications of leader location in uncoordinated chains. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the entire sequence of successive contracts when assessing the performance of a supply chain. We find that in some cases an inefficient supply chain may have a natural tendency to reduce inefficiency through cooperation between non-leader members.

We first consider that in order to mitigate channel conflict the manufacturer, who chooses wholesale prices as a Stackelberg leader, commits to setting a direct channel retail price that matches the retailer's price in the traditional channel. We find that the specific equal-pricing strategy that optimizes profits for the manufacturer is also preferred by the retailer and customers over other equal-pricing strategies. We next consider the implications of the equal-pricing constraint through a numerical experiment that indicates that the equal-pricing strategy is appropriate as long as the Internet channel is significantly less convenient than the traditional channel. If the Internet channel is of comparable convenience to the traditional channel, then the manufacturer has tremendous incentive to abandon the equal-pricing policy, at great peril to the traditional retailer.

We assume a periodic review model with stochastic demand, lost sales, and order quantity restrictions. The product lifetime is fixed and deterministic once received by the retailer, although the age of replenished items provided by the supplier varies stochastically over time. Since the product is perishable, any unsold inventory remaining after the lifetime elapses must be discarded (outdated). Without the supplier explicitly informing the retailer of the product age, the age remains unknown until receipt. With information sharing, the retailer is informed of the product age prior to placing an order and hence, can utilize this information in its decision-making. We formulate the retailer's replenishment policies, with and without knowing the age of the product upon receipt, and measure the VOI as the marginal improvement in profit that the retailer achieves with information sharing, relative to the case when no information is shared. We establish the importance of information sharing and identify the conditions under which substantial benefits can be realized.

Performance change and parity in operational performance are investigated in three geographically defined operating regions of a single firm. Order lead time, the elapsed time between receipt of an order and shipment to a customer, is used as a measure of operational performance. A single ES installation was deployed across all regions of the subject firm's operations. Findings illustrate parity as an immediate consequence of ES deployment. However, differences in rates of performance improvement following deployment eventually result in significant (albeit smaller than pre-deployment) performance differences. An additional consequence of deployment seems to be an increased synchronization of performance across the formerly independent regions.

The arrival rate and the proportion of servers present are treated as random variables. The basic model is a multi-server queue with customer abandonment, allowing non-exponential service-time and time-to-abandon distributions. The goal is to maximize the expected net return, given throughput benefit and server, customer-abandonment and customer-waiting costs, but attention is also given to the standard deviation of the return. The approach is to approximate the performance and the net return, conditional on the random model-parameter vector, and then uncondition to get the desired results. Two recently-developed approximations are used for the conditional performance measures: first, a deterministic fluid approximation and, second, a numerical algorithm based on a purely Markovian birth-and-death model, having state-dependent death rates.

This metric is defined to be the percentage of customers whose actual waiting time was less than their individual waiting time threshold. We label this metric the Percentage of Satisfied Customers (PSC.) This threshold is a reflection of the customers' expectation of a reasonable waiting time in the system given its current state. Cases in which no system state information is available to the customer are referred to as "hidden queues." For such systems, the waiting time threshold is independent of the length of the waiting line, and it is randomly drawn from a distribution of threshold values for the customer population. The literature generally assumes that such thresholds are exponentially distributed. For these cases, we derive closed form expressions for our performance metric for a variety of possible service time distributions. We also relax this assumption for cases where service times are exponential and derive closed form results for a large class of threshold distributions. We analyze such queues for both single and multi-server systems. We refer to cases in which customers may observe the length of the line as "revealed" queues." We perform a parallel analysis for both single and multi-server revealed queues. The chief distinction is that for these cases, customers may develop threshold values that are dependent upon the number of customers in the system upon their arrival. The new perspective this paper brings to the modeling of the performance of waiting line systems allows us to rethink and suggest ways to enhance the effectiveness of various managerial options for improving the service quality and customer satisfaction of waiting line systems. We conclude with many useful insights on ways to improve customer satisfaction in waiting line situations that follow directly from our analysis.

Service guarantees have been hypothesized to positively affect customer perception of service quality (and/or customer intention to return) through their positive effect on both learning through service failure and employee motivation. However, there has been no long-term study of these effects. A longitudinal, empirical study was conducted to investigate the question of whether a service guarantee program is a short-term fix or a long-term solution. The service guarantee was found to have a positive, long-term effect on both employee motivation and customer intention to return. However, the service guarantee did not have a significant direct effect on employee perceptions of improvement through learning from service failure. This research highlights the need for organizations to make better use of the information and knowledge gained from invocations of a service guarantee and strongly supports using a service guarantee to improve customer loyalty and increase employee motivation.

Our problem has a number of general features such as demand fluctuation, operating and maintenance costs that depend on the amount of capacity utilized, capacity disposal, and capacity shortage. Formulated as a mixed integer programming model, we are able to exploit special structures inherent in the problem to develop primal-based and dual-based heuristic solution methods. We discuss the merits of our solution approach based on results obtained by solving a wide array of reasonably sized randomly generated problems.

Four distributions of estimation errors are examined in eight different simulated shop environments representing DRC and ML job shops with different labor utilization levels and dispatching rules. A unique approach to setting total-work-content-based due dates is introduced and recommended as more appropriate than the approaches previously used. The mean and standard deviation of the absolute value of lateness are reported as performance measures. The results indicate that errors in the estimation of processing times have a significant impact on shop performance. Specifically, optimistic and high variance estimated processing time distributions produce significantly worse shop performance than accurate and pessimistic errors. The interactions between the effects of the estimated processing time distribution and due date tightness are also shown to be significant.

There is an on-going debate over the effectiveness of TQM in the literature. This study investigates a number of controversial benefits of TQM. We seek to determine if TQM is generally beneficial to the firms that adopt it, and if these firms gain operational efficiency over time and secure institutional values. We also attempt to discern if advanced TQM adopters lead to different management paradigms, as proponents of TQM claim, or if both TQM and non-TQM firms can be equally successful. Based on a study of 225 TQM and non-TQM electronics manufacturing firms in Hong Kong, we find that the adoption of TQM correlates with significant advances in performance measures. However, unlike other organizational innovations, the implementation of TQM in industry does not follow a social perspective in institutional theory that there seems to be no legitimacy effect. A comparison of advanced TQM firms and leading non-TQM firms reveals that they do not differ in their organizational performances. No distinctive TQM paradigms are found, implying equifinality in quality management.

Call centers have been a fertile area for operations management researchers in several domains, including forecasting, capacity planning, queueing, and personnel scheduling. In addition, as telecommunications and information technology have advanced over the past several years, the operational challenges faced by call center managers have become more complicated. Issues associated with human resources management, sales, and marketing have also become increasingly relevant to call center operations and associated academic research. In this paper, we provide a survey of the recent literature on call center operations management. Along with traditional research areas, we pay special attention to new management challenges that have been caused by emerging technologies, to behavioral issues associated with both call center agents and customers, and to the interface between call center operations and sales and marketing. We identify a handful of broad themes for future investigation while also pointing out several very specific research opportunities.

Revenue management in such markets calls for real-time techniques to learn the demand and its dependence on both the price and the service level associated with the service offering. We assume firms reply on exploratory approaches for demand estimation, in which firms experiment with different service offerings in order to simultaneously learn the demand while doing business. Such exploration and learning process can be costly without supervision. As reported by Rothschild (journal of Economic Theory, 9 185-202,1974), traditional Bayesian dynamic control approaches may conclude with suboptimal offerings. We propose a novel demand learning approach that is guaranteed to converge to the optimal offering. The approach combines simulated annealing algorithm with Bayesian learning. We further present intelligent techniques that adaptively reduce the effort of exploration on suboptimal service offerings so as to improve the long-run average profit.

The forecasts are used to set booking limits for lower value customers to ensure an adequate supply for higher value customers. The very use of booking limits, however, constrains the historical demand data needed for an accurate forecast. Ignoring this interaction leads to substantial penalties in a firm's potential revenues. We review existing unconstraining methods and propose a new method that includes some attractive properties not found in the existing methods. We evaluate several of the common unconstraining methods against our proposed method by testing them on intentionally constrained simulated data. Results indicate our proposed method outperforms other methods in two of three data sets. We also test the revenue impact of our proposed method, expectation maximization (EM), and "no unconstraining" on actual booking data from a hotel/casino. We show that performance varies with the initial starting protection limits and a lack of unconstraining leads to significant revenue losses.

We validate this model empirically using cross-sectional survey data from U.S. manufacturing plants. We find that some IT applications are more effective at enabling the outsourcing of business processes than others. For example, the implementation of enterprise management systems is associated with the outsourcing of both production and support processes, whereas operations management systems are not associated with the outsourcing of plant processes. Plants with a low-cost outsourcing strategy are more likely to outsource support processes than plants with a competency-focused outsourcing strategy. However, both cost- and competency-based strategies have a positive and similar impact on the outsourcing of production processes. In terms of implications for plant performance, our findings indicate that the outsourcing of production and support processes is associated with higher gross margins. Although plant IT infrastructure is positively associated with favorable on-time delivery rates, there is no positive association between the incidence of plant outsourcing and on-time delivery rates. These results have implications for crafting plant-level outsourcing strategies and for investments in IT systems to facilitate the outsourcing of business processes for enhanced plant performance.

We model a three-stage game in which firms invest in emissions abatement, participate in a share auction for permits, and produce output. We develop a methodology for a profit-maximizing firm to derive its marginal value function for permits and translate this value function into an optimal bidding strategy in the auction. We analyze two end-product market scenarios-independent demands and Cournot competition. In both scenarios we find that changing the number of available permits influences abatement to a lesser extent in a dirty industry than in a cleaner one. In addition, abatement levels taper off with increasing industry dirtiness levels. In the presence of competition, firms in a relatively clean industry can, in fact, benefit from a reduction in the number of available permits. Our findings are robust to changes in certain modeling assumptions.

An annotated bibliography of selected other contributions reviews the breadth of topics that have occupied Kleindorfer's research attention over his now 45(+) years of research. These include optimal control theory, scheduling theory, decision sciences, investment planning and peak load pricing, plus a number of important applications in network industries and insurance. In the area of operations risk management, we review recent work that Kleindorfer and his colleagues in the Wharton Risk Center have undertaken on environmental management and operations, focusing on process safety and environmental risks in the chemical industry. This work is directly related to Kleindorfer's work in the broader area of "sustainable operations", which he, Kal Singhal and Luk Van Wassenhove recently surveyed as part of the new initiative at POMS to encompass sustainable management practices within the POMS community. Continuing in the area of supply chain risks, the paper reviews Kleindorfer's contributions to the development of an integrated framework for contracting and risk hedging for supply management. The emphasis on alignment of pricing, performance and risk management in this framework is presaged in the work undertaken by Kleindorfer and his co-authors in the 1980s on after-sales support services for high-technology products. This work on supply chain risk, and its successors, is reviewed here in light of its growing importance in managing the unbundled and global supply chains characteristic of the new economy.

Promising full inventory transparency, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has often been suggested as a remedy to the problem. We consider inventory record inaccuracy in a supply chain model, where a Stackelberg manufacturer sets the wholesale price and a retailer determines how much to stock for sale to customers. We first analyze the impact of inventory record inaccuracy on optimal stocking decisions and profits. By contrasting optimal decisions in a decentralized supply chain with those in an integrated supply chain, we find that inventory record inaccuracy exacerbates the inefficiencies resulting from double marginalization in decentralized supply chains. Assuming RFID technology can eliminate the problem of inventory record inaccuracy, we determine the cost thresholds at which RFID adoption becomes profitable. We show that a decentralized supply chain benefits more from RFID technology, such that RFID adoption improves supply chain coordination.

We report the system design and implementation, and discuss our experiences and lessons learned. The aim of the RFID system is to effectively support the tracking and tracing of aeroplane repairable items in the company. The study reveals eight critical success factors for the successful implementation of RFID systems, namely, create strong internal and external motivation for improvement, stir up desire to keep abreast of the latest technology for global competitiveness, strive for cross organizational implementation, avoid major process changes/limit process changes, start with a small RFID project scope, facilitate equipment vendor's investment, use cost-effectiveness reusable tags, and transfer RFID skills and knowledge from university to industry. We also summarize 13 lessons learned, including three lessons concerning RFID implementation at strategic level, six lessons at management level, and four lessons at operational level resulting from carrying out this project. Given the contextual details of the study, the lessons learned can help other firms to better anticipate the hurdles they will experience, and make them aware of the possible ways to cope with such difficulties before embarking on the journey of RFID implementation.

The institutional pressure emanates from the Department of Defense, and the affected decentralized business units operate in a large defense contractor. Institutional theory explains how organizations respond to external pressures to adopt new procedures, policies, and technologies. The case studies show how business units vary in their response to the RFID mandate and how different internal dynamics manifest. The responses range from complying faithfully, primarily concerned with satisfying the external constituent, to completely ignoring the mandate and focusing on internal efficiency initiative utilizing RFID. A number of propositions are developed to better understand the organizational responses to exogenous pressure to implement RFID. The paper concludes by proposing future research directions and issues that must be considered further.

We present a simulation study conducted at a regional hospital for which data related to trauma patient movement was collected with an RFID-based system.

Building on previous research in information systems and supply chain management, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for RFID adoption and benefits, and tests the framework using data on u.s. firms. Our analysis suggests that there is a positive association between information technology (IT) application deployment and RFID adoption. We find that RFID implementation spending and partner mandate are associated with an expectation of early return on RFID investment, and a perceived lack of industry-wide standards is associated with an expectation of delayed return on RFID investment. These results suggest that firms with broad IT application deployment and a critical mass of RFID implementation spending are more likely to report early returns from RFID deployments. This paper extends previous research to understand the relationship between organization characteristics and adoption and expected benefits of the emerging RFID technology.

At these early stages of adoption, one puzzling issue for retailers and suppliers is the compelling business case for RFID. In order to explore the potential business case for RFID, we conducted a case study using actual RFID data collected by a major retailer for the cases shipped by one of its major suppliers. We show the physical layout of the RFID readers on a partial supply-chain covering product movement from distribution centers to retail stores. First, in the analysis phase, we identify several performance metrics that can be computed from the RFID readings. Next, using this RFID data, we compute the values of those performance metrics. These values represent mean time between movements at different locations. Then, we discuss how these measures can assist in improving logistical performance at a micro supply chain level of operations between a distribution center and a retail store. We present how such information can be valuable to both the retail store operator and the supplier. We also discuss the initial lessons learned from actual RFID data collected in the field, in terms of data quality issues.

All returned items go through an evaluation process, at the end of which the decision of disposal, direct reselling, or rework is made for each unit according to a predetermined procedure. We quantify the value of information/visibility on the reverse channel for the manufacturer by making comparisons among three approaches: No information-naive; no visibility-enlightened; and full visibility. We find the value of visibility increases with the comparative length of the reverse channel and volume, volatility, and usability of returns. Furthermore, the smarter the manufacturer, the less benefit visibility brings to the system. By this analysis, we quantify the visibility savings of radio frequency identification (RFID) in the reverse channel as a candidate enabler technology. We also provide numerical examples to show that practical approximations in inventory management may have acceptable penalties to the manufacturer with visibility.

This paper examines three dimensions of the value proposition of RFID and attempts to identify areas for further investigation. The first dimension consists of the generic architecture of RFID implementations and the drivers of value that can result from its components. The second consists of measurement issues associated with quantification of value. Since the complete benefits of RFID will only result when multiple independent organizations deploy the technology and coordinate the resulting information flows, the third dimension addresses incentives for achieving that diffusion. The collection of issues identified through this exercise offers an initial roadmap to view ongoing research and recognize additional problems for further investigation.

In many situations, they have replaced negotiations for supplier selection and price setting. while they have often greatly reduced transaction costs and increased competition, they have also encountered problems and resistance from suppliers resenting their intrusion on cooperative supplier/buyer relationships. In response to these issues, procurement auctions have evolved in radical new directions. Buyers use business rules to limit adverse changes. Some procurement auctions allow bidders to offer variants in the specifications of products to be supplied. Most important, some suppliers are allowing bidders to bid on packages of items, not just individual items. This tends to change procurement auctions from zero-sum fights over supplier profit margins to win-win searches for synergies. These changes have opened up many new research areas. Researchers are trying to improve how to deal with the computational issues involved in package auctions and to analyze the new auctions forms that are evolving. In general, equilibrium incentives are not known, and dealing with ties in package auctions is an issue. Computer scientists are analyzing the use of computerized bidding agents.

In traditional optimization, a central authority is asked to solve a (computationally hard) optimization problem. In contrast, in distributed settings there are several agents, possibly equipped with private information that is not publicly known, and these agents must interact to derive a solution to the problem. Usually the agents have their individual preferences, which induces them to behave strategically to manipulate the resulting solution. Nevertheless, one is often interested in the global performance of such systems. The analysis of such distributed settings requires techniques from classical optimization, game theory, and economic theory. The paper therefore briefly introduces the most important of the underlying concepts and gives a selection of typical research questions and recent results, focusing on applications to machine scheduling problems. This includes the study of the so-called price of anarchy for settings where the agents do not possess private information, as well as the design and analysis of (truthful) mechanisms in settings where the agents do possess private information.

In this paper, we study the effect of bidding competition, information asymmetry, reserve price, bid decrement, auction duration, and bidder type on buyer surplus. We collected field data on more than 700 online procurement auctions conducted by a leading auctioneer and involving procurement items worth millions of dollars. Consistent with the predictions of auction theory, the results indicate that bidding competition, reserve price, and information sharing affect buyer surplus. Unlike previous findings in the consumer-to-consumer context, we find that bid decrement and auction duration have no effect in 13213 procurement auctions. Our results suggest that use of the rank-bidding format increases buyer surplus when incumbent suppliers participate in the auction. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for future research and for optimal design of online procurement auctions.

With the recent development of on-line markets, auctions are becoming an increasingly popular procurement method. The emergence of Internet marketplaces makes auction participation much easier and more convenient, since no physical presence of bidders is required. In addition, bidders in on-line auctions can easily switch their identities. Thus, it may very well happen that the bidders in an auction have very little, if any, prior knowledge about the distributions of other bidders' valuations. We are proposing an efficient distribution of collusive profit for second-price sealed bid auctions in such an environment. Unlike some known mechanism, which balance the budget only in expectation, our approach (which we call Random k) balances the budget ex-post. While truth-telling is not a dominant strategy for Random k, it is a minimax regret equilibrium.

Traditional models of the English auction ignore timing issues by assuming that the auction occurs instantaneously. However, when auctions are slow, as Internet auctions used for procurement often are, there are significant opportunity or monitoring costs to bidders, and the choice of the size of the jump bid becomes a strategic decision. We study the choice in the experimental laboratory by systematically varying the opportunity costs associated with fast bidding. When time is more valuable bidders respond by choosing larger jump bids. Surprisingly, the economic performance of the auction is not significantly affected. We develop a simple model of ascending auctions with impatient bidders that provides insights into the effect jump bids have on auction performance.

Modeling the auction problem as a Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem and using dynamic programming, we show that incremental computations during bid processing can speed the handling of key auction operations such as clearing and quoting. We propose different price-quote policies and study their influence on the efficiency of market-based allocation. Using a reconfigurable manufacturing scenario where agents trade large quantities of multiple goods, we demonstrate potential benefits of supporting indivisibility constraints in bidding. These benefits are highly sensitive to the form of price quote provided, indicating interesting tradeoffs in communication and allocation efficiency.

This setting has promising applications in areas such as keyword auctions in the search engine advertising industry, the sale of quality-ranked raw materials, etc. An auction mechanism suitable for this setting is the simultaneous pooled auction (SPA), where each bidder simultaneously submits a single bid and is allocated an object based on the rank of his bid among all the bids. We study how to improve the seller's expected revenue by enforcing a reserve price in an SPA. We find that the use of an appropriate reserve price may significantly increase the seller's revenue, especially when the number of items for sale is relatively large compared to the number of participating bidders. One inherent problem in the SPA is that some bidders may incur ex post losses; that is, they pay more than what they value the received objects. We propose a tailored VCG mechanism that generates the same expected revenue as the SPA does, while bidders do not incur any ex post loss. We also discuss the potential applications of this research to keyword auctions.

Since customer service representatives (agents) have different call-handling abilities and are typically cross-trained in multiple skills, contact centers exploit skill-based routing (SBR) to assign calls to appropriate agents, aiming to respond properly as well as promptly. Established agent-staffing and SBR algorithms ensure that agents have the required call-handling skills and that call routing is performed so that constraints are met for standard congestion measures, such as the percentage of calls of each type that abandon before starting service and the percentage of answered calls of each type that are delayed more than a specified number of seconds. We propose going beyond traditional congestion measures to focus on the expected value derived from having particular agents handle various calls. Expected value might represent expected revenue or the likelihood of first-call resolution. Value might also reflect agent call-handling preferences. We show how value-based routing (VBR) and preference-based routing (PBR) can be introduced in the context of an existing SBR framework, based on static-priority routing using a highly-structured priority matrix, so that constraints are still met for standard congestion measures. Since an existing SBR framework is used to implement VBR and PBR, it is not necessary to replace the automatic call distributor (ACD). We show how mathematical programming can be used, with established staffing requirements, to find a desirable priority matrix. We select the priority matrix to use during a specified time interval (e.g., 30-minute period) by maximizing the total expected value over that time interval, subject to staffing constraints.

An etailer may sell its product not only through its online and bricks-and-mortar stores, but also through the websites of one or more third parties (e.g., Yahoo.com). However, the etailer has to pay a certain amount to such third parties in an action-based payment scheme, such as a cost-per-click (CPC) scheme. Under the CPC scheme, payment is based solely on click-throughs, which means that the etailer pays only when a shopper clicks through to the product page of its website. Only a fraction of such clicks lead to actual sales. The extra cost that is associated with shoppers who first click through to the third-party websites makes them less attractive as customers than those who directly visit the etailer's online store. Moreover, the CPC rate for a prominent placement is normally set by competitive bidding, and thus varies over time. Therefore, the etailer needs to decide dynamically whether or not to list on a third-party website. The structural properties of the optimal policy are discussed, and numerical examples are given to show the revenue impact of dynamic listing control.

Since the leftover product is often perceived to be of lower quality than the new product, carrying it over offers the firm a second selling opportunity, a product line extension to new and unsold units, and the ability to price discriminate. By doing so, however, the firm subjects sales of its new product to competition from the leftover product. We present a two period model that captures the effect of this competition on the firm's production and pricing decisions. We characterize the firm's optimal strategy and find conditions under which the firm is better off carrying all, some, or none of its leftover inventory. We also show that, compared to a firm that acts myopically in the first period, a firm that takes into account the effect of first period decisions on second period profits will price its new product higher and stock more of it in the first period. Thus, the benefit of having a second selling opportunity dominates the detrimental effect of cannibalizing sales of the second period new product.

The buyer has two procurement opportunities with the second one after observing a market signal, which updates the demand forecast. He also commits to a service level after observing the market signal. We derive his optimal ordering decisions and show that the critical market signal, the optimal first-stage order quantity, and the optimal expected profit are monotone with respect to the target service level. We also discuss the impact of the forecast quality on the optimal decisions. We show that the optimal first-stage order quantity may not be monotone with respect to information accuracy, as is in the case without the service constraint. In addition, we extend our analysis to the situation when an order cancellation is allowed upon the observation of the market signal. We also compare the results obtained for the problems with and without an order cancelation. Finally, we discuss the supply chain coordination issue and find that a buyback contract can also coordinate the supply chain in the presence of the service constraint.

Our goal is to reduce overall service system costs by allowing assembly and/or disassembly (A/D) to occur at some unit cost per A/D action. In an extensive set of computational experiments, we compare a naive stocking and operating policy that treats all items independently and ignores the modular product structure and related A/D capability to the optimal base stock policy, and to a policy that allows A/D from the naive stocking levels. While extensive computational analysis shows that the optimal base stock policy improves the system cost between 3 to 26% over the naive approach, simply allowing A/D from the naive stocking levels captures a significant portion (an average of 67%) of the naive-optimal gap. Our computational results demonstrate that the optimization shifts the component-assembly mix from the naive levels and that limiting A/D capacity affects this mix. Limiting A/D capacity can actually increase the expected number of A/D actions (versus the uncapacitated case), since the optimization shifts stocking levels to reduce the probability that "too many" actions will be required.

Such situations arise when it takes a while to process the demand data, count the inventory, and pass the results to the IM. We show that the optimal total inventory-related cost decreases when the length of the information delay decreases. The amount of the decrease is an important datum for an IM interested in considering whether or not to invest in reducing the delay. The investment is required to finance design and acquisition of an information (collection and dissemination) system that can reduce the information delay. Such systems include phone calls, business meetings, and the use of information collection mechanisms such as radiofrequency identification tags.

The consumer choice process is characterized by a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. When the store traffic is a continuous random variable, we explicitly derive the structure of the optimal assortment. Our approach is to use a comprehensive measure-profit rate to evaluate the profitability of each variant and then determine which product should be offered. We demonstrate that the optimal assortment contains the few items that have the highest profit rate. When the store traffic is discrete, the optimal solution is difficult to obtain. We propose a "profit rate" heuristic, which is inspired by the result for the case of continuous store traffic. In a special case with equal cost parameters and normal demand distribution, the profit rate heuristic is indeed optimal. Using randomly generated data, we test the effectiveness of the heuristic and find that the average percentage error is less than 0.1% and that the hit rate is above 90%. Our research provides managerial insights on assortment planning and accentuates the importance of measuring the profitability of each product when the demand is random and cannibalization among different products exists.

As elements are created, certain parts of the system (referred to as "groups") become functional and provide value, even though the entire system has not been completed. The main tradeoff in the sequencing problem arises from elements that belong to multiple groups. On the one hand, creating groups with common elements early in the project reduces the effort required to build later functionality that uses these elements. On the other hand, the early creation of such groups can delay the release of some critical functionality. We formulate the element sequencing problem and propose a heuristic to solve it. This heuristic is compared against a lower bound developed for the problem. Next, we study a more general version of the element sequencing problem in which an element requires some effort to be made reusable. When a reusable element is used in another group, some more effort is needed to specialize the element to work as desired in that group. We study reuse decisions under a weighted completion time objective (i.e., the sum of the completion time of each group weighted by its value is minimized), and show how these decisions differ from those under a traditional makespan objective (i.e., only the final completion time of the project is minimized). A variety of analytical and numerical results are presented. The model is also implemented on data obtained from a real software project. A key finding of this work is that the optimal effort on reuse is never increased (typically lowered) when a weighted completion time objective is used. This finding has implications for managing reuse in projects in which user value influences the order in which functionality is created.

His early work made innovative contributions to probability theory and utility estimation that enabled existing Operations Research theory to be applicable to real problems. Later, inspired by field trips to Japanese and German manufacturers, he joined Kim Clark to conduct an ambitious study of 12 plants in three companies, establishing the impact on productivity of factors such as reject rate, work-inprocess, and production rate variation. In the 1980s, when adoption of advanced manufacturing automation was in vogue, Bob joined Jai Jaikuxriar to offer a caution, that new manufacturing technologies required new ways of managing and that advanced technology coupled with obsolete management would produce poorer, not better, results. Perhaps Bob's greatest contribution was to raise OM to a more strategic level. With numerous coauthors, notably Steve Wheelwright, he provided a framework for corporate and manufacturing strategy and showed how to achieve alignment between the two, particularly in the choice of production processes. Recent papers articulated a vision for OM in which a focus on the issues of operating managers provides a consistent framework, but enables our research agenda to evolve as the world's economy changes.

We employ a rigorous procedure whereby both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through multiple rounds of interviews and card-sorting exercises with senior service managers. This iterative refinement process helps ensure that the construct domains and definitions are consistent and that they are applicable across multiple service sectors. A primary contribution of this research is to provide precise operational definitions of theoretically important NSD practice constructs. Importantly, this study expands on the NSD literature by including both resource- and process-centric perspectives within a single framework. A second contribution is to illustrate a general methodology for developing clear, concise, and consistent construct definitions that may be generally useful for production and operations management scholars interested in new construct development for emerging areas. Empirical results suggest that the resource-process framework can help guide and organize future research on, and provide insight into, a more comprehensive view of new service development.

In this paper we present the results of our exploratory research into two interrelated topics: the explicit inclusion of customer time in nonemergency field service delivery decisions and the analysis of trade-off between the customer's convenience and field service provider's cost. Based on prior research in service quality we identify and illustrate two time-based performance metrics that are particularly appropriate for assessing service quality in nonemergency field services: performance and conformance quality. To determine vehicle routes, we develop a hybrid heuristic derived from the existing and proven heuristic methods. A numerical example closely patterned after real-life data is generated and used within a computational experiment to investigate alternate policies for promise time windows. Our experiment shows that over a reasonable range of customer cost parameters the policy of shorter promise time windows reduces the combined total cost incurred by the provider and the customers and should be considered

A possible explanation is that although the resource-based view holds that competitive advantage is derived from inimitable resources, ERP software has become a commodity. Socio-technical theory suggests that internal organizational resources based on a foundation of ERP technology may be the true drivers of ERP benefits. A firm's strategic configuration is posited to influence the portfolio of organizational competencies available to leverage the benefits of integrated business information, and a number of hypotheses are developed based on the notion that firms with different strategic objectives will realize different operational benefits from the adoption of ERP systems. Survey data from North American manufacturing firms that have implemented ERP systems demonstrate that ERP adopters seeking operational performance improvements are likely to realize these benefits. On the other hand, those seeking external market and supply chain performance improvements must first establish a foundation of internal operational performance improvements before customer satisfaction and supply chain benefits can be realized.

In this work, we focus on the activity network-based process models that support PD project management and present a comprehensive survey of the literature published in the last decade. To organize our survey, we use a framework based on the purposes of PD process models: project visualization, project planning, project control, and project development. For each purpose, we provide an overview of the relevant models, highlight their key assumptions and findings, synthesize key insights, and illuminate avenues for further research. Although the survey reveals many insights and opportunities, five major areas for future study became apparent: activity interactions, global process improvements, process models as an organizing structure for knowledge management, modeling in cases of uncertainty and ambiguity, and determining the optimum amount of process prescription and structure for an innovative project.

In other words, the IM observes only the inventory level that belongs to an earlier period. Such situations are not uncommon, and they arise when it takes a while to process the demand data and pass the results to the IM. We introduce dynamic information delays as a Markov process into the standard multiperiod stochastic inventory problem with backorders. We develop the concept of a reference inventory position. We show that this position along with the magnitude of the latest observed delay and the age of this observation are sufficient statistics for finding the optimal order quantities. Furthermore, we establish that the optimal ordering policy is of state-dependent base-stock type with respect to the reference inventory position (or state-dependent (s, S) type if there is a fixed ordering cost). The optimal base stock and (s, S) levels depend on the magnitude of the latest observed delay and the age of this observation. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the optimal base stock and the optimal cost with respect to the sufficient statistics.

However, it is often difficult to link specific operational practices to strategic level outcomes and in turn to corporate financial results. This presents problems for both managers and academic researchers attempting to justify the often high cost of operational improvement initiatives in terms of objective accounting metrics. This study provides evidence that it is possible to demonstrate linkages between carefully chosen. portfolios of tactical, strategic, and financial metrics. Survey data from 118 manufacturers are used to evaluate hypotheses linking multilevel metrics of performance across three well-established strategic foci. We present portfolios of metrics drawn from the literature and from the Supply Chain Council's supply-chain operations reference model and related design and customer chain models. Our analysis suggests that metric portfolios in which tactical metrics are designed to match strategic-level metrics, based on alignment with a specific strategic focus, provide clearer mechanisms for understanding performance linkages.

Analyzing these systems is not straightforward, because standard queueing theory focuses on the long-run steady-state behavior of stationary models. We show how to adapt stationary queueing models for use in nonstationary environments so that time-dependent performance is captured and staffing requirements can be set. Relatively little modification of straightforward stationary analysis applies in systems where service times are short and the targeted quality of service is high. When service times are moderate and the targeted quality of service is still high, time-lag refinements can improve traditional stationary independent period-by-period and peak-hour approximations. Time-varying infinite-server models help develop refinements, because closed-form expressions exist for their time-dependent behavior. More difficult cases with very long service times and other complicated features, such as end-of-day effects, can often be treated by a modified-offered-load approximation, which is based on an associated infinite-server model. Numerical algorithms and deterministic fluid models are useful when the system is overloaded for an extensive period of time. Our discussion focuses on telephone call centers, but applications to police patrol, banking, and hospital emergency rooms are also mentioned.

As such, it can give unprecedented visibility to the supply chain. Such visibility can save labor cost, improve supply chain coordination, reduce inventory, and increase product availability. Industry reports and white papers are now filled with estimates and proclamations of the benefits and quantified values of RFID. Early adopters are now rallying more and more followers. However, most such claims are educated guesses at best and are not substantiated, that is, they are not based on detailed, model-based analysis. This paper argues that there is a huge credibility gap of the value of RFID, and that a void exists in showing how the proclaimed values are arrived at, and how those values can be realized. The paper shows that this credibility gap must be filled with solid model analysis, and therefore presents a great opportunity for the Production and Operations Management (POM) research community. The paper reviews some of the ongoing research efforts that attempt to close the credibility gap, and suggests additional directions for further strengthening the POM's contribution to help industry realize the full potentials of RFID.

Various qualitative studies have predicted that conflict will arise, in particular in decentralized supply chains, from the fact that the benefits and the costs resulting from item-level RFID are not symmetrically distributed among supply chain partners. To contribute to a better understanding of this situation, we consider a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer. Within the context of this retail supply chain, we present analytic models of the benefits of item-level RFID to both supply chain partners. We examine both the case of a dominant manufacturer as well as the case of a dominant retailer, and we analyze the results of an introduction of item-level RFID to such a supply chain depending on these market power characteristics. Under each scenario, we show how the cost of item-level RFID should be allocated among supply chain partners such that supply chain profit is optimized.

To motivate the problem, we use as a setting a high-tech manufacturing company that operates in a competitive environment, is not a leader in the industry, and is constantly reacting to bundles introduced by the leader. Bundles are sets of components that must meet technical constraints. The company's objective is to build a bundle and offer it in a market where it will compete with other bundles. Consumers purchase the bundle that maximizes their utility after examining all available bundles. The company selection of the bundle's components and its price is made in light of the bundles against which it will be competing and the uncertainty in the consumer choice process. The optimal decision could be found by solving a nonlinear mixed integer program, which is difficult to solve. Instead, we propose an efficient solution procedure to determine the optimal composition of the bundle and the price at which it should be offered. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of extensions of the research to cases that consider multiple segments of customers and/or multiple bundles.

The company traditionally offered speed-of-service pricing to its customers, but without day-of-week differentiation, resulting in customer demands with considerable day-of-week seasonality. The package delivery company hoped that using day-of-week and speed-of-service price differentiation for contract customers would induce these customers to adjust their demands to become counter-cyclical to the non-contract demand. Although this usually cannot be achieved by pricing alone, we devise an approach that utilizes day-of-week and speed-of-service pricing as an element of a Pareto-improving contract. The contract provides the lowest-cost arrangement for the package delivery company while ensuring that the customer is at least as well off as he would have been under the existing pricing structure. The contract pricing smoothes the package delivery company's demand and reduces peak requirements for transport capacity. The latter helps to decrease capital costs, which may allow a further price reduction for the customer. We formulate the pricing problem as a biconvex optimization model, and present a methodology for designing the contract and numerical examples that illustrate the achievable savings.

In our capacity game model, a monopolistic supplier has to build capacity before observing the uncertain demand. The demand is generated by two potential customers, who privately know their own types. The types could be either high or low, differing in willingness to pay for each unit of demand. To discriminate between the customer types, the supplier designs option contracts so that only the high type will buy options in advance. The high type will do so because the options can hedge their risk of demand loss when capacity is tight. The supplier profits in three ways. First, the high type customers pay higher marginal prices on average. Second, the high type customers' demand is satisfied as a first priority, guaranteeing allocation efficiency. Third, the supplier can observe the number of options being purchased and so determine customer types, improving capacity investment efficiency. We compare our results to those of classical second degree price discrimination. We show that our proposed framework guarantees the same level of supplier profit even when the supplier cannot discriminate between the customers by bundling products.

The notion of relative prices motivates us to consider a situation in which a retailer would either charge the same retail price for all products if he adopts a 'fixed' pricing strategy or charge different prices for different products if he adopts a 'variable' pricing strategy. In this paper, we develop a base model with deterministic demand that is intended to examine how a retailer should jointly determine the order quantity and the retail price of two substitutable products under the fixed and variable pricing strategies. Our analysis indicates that the optimal retail price under the variable pricing strategy is equal to the optimal retail price under the fixed pricing strategy plus or minus an adjustment term. This adjustment term depends on product substitutability and price sensitivity. We also present two different extensions of our base model. In the first extension, our analysis indicates that the underlying structure of the optimal retail price and order quantity is preserved when there is a lin-tit on the total order quantity. The second extension deals with the issue of retail competition. Relative to the base case, we show that the underlying structure of the optimal retail price and order quantity is preserved in a duopolistic environment. Moreover, our analysis suggests that both retailers would adopt the variable pricing strategy at the equilibrium.

Industry cluster theory emphasizes the explicit and implicit benefits that accrue to various economic players due to geographic proximity. As such, it provides a contrasting view to the current pressure on supply chains to seek out the "best" partners, regardless of location. We review the theory behind industry clusters, and illustrate it using the example of the New England cotton textile industry. Incorporating these concepts into future research has the potential to improve our understanding of how decisions regarding supply chain location and sourcing decisions are currently made, and what role location-based benefits should play in these decisions.

This problem is not due to a lack of interesting initiatives but because our several active subfields are pulling LIS in different directions and causing our common ground to shrink. This is at a time when firms around the globe are facing perplexing operating problems that are apparently not resolvable through existing theories and techniques. Other academic fields have experienced similar strains at certain points, and they tend to get to that point following a progression like those that production and operations management has witnessed three times in the past 50 years. After briefly describing these past histories, I propose that we are near the end of one cycle and need a new jolt of energy to begin another. The problems of coordinating the complex collaborations among networked organizations (the Coordination of Operations across Multiple Organizations) are becoming increasingly important in today's economy I suggest that intensive multiteam studies of such networks could provide new insights into these pressing problems, stimulate creativity, and help reunify our field.

Using a case study method with multiple suppliers of two large buying firms, we mapped factors that initiated and improved environmental capabilities in small- and medium-sized enterprises over time. Through several specific mechanisms, buyers' green supply chain management initiated and then enabled the improvement of suppliers' environmental capabilities. Independent of buyers, internal championing of environmental concerns also provided an impetus for small- and. medium-sized enterprise suppliers to acquire resources outside the supply chain. Thus, synergistic linkages emerged in supportive buyer-supplier relationships, resource acquisition, and capability development. When these findings are combined with earlier research on larger suppliers, an integrative framework emerges that provides direction for suppliers, buyers, and public agencies seeking to improve environmental performance.

First, because multifunction products provide complete or partial functionalities of single-function products, we incorporate substitution or cannibalization effects between the potential products. Second, we explicitly model the variable costs of manufacturing the single-function and multifunction products. Third, we examine the firm's pricing decisions because of their impact on the degree of cannibalization between the multifunction product and one or more single-function products. Using an economic model, we first characterize the firm's optimal product portfolio (through a quantity-based decision), which in turn determines the market equilibrium prices for each product in its portfolio. Some of the unique insights stemming from our analysis are: (a) the optimal product portfolio choice is driven primarily by maximum profit margins for the single-function products weighted by the demand substitution effects; and (6) from a product design perspective, the complete functionality of the base single-function product is always included in the optimal product offering, but this is not necessarily the case with the complete functionality of the nonbase single-function product.

To this end, we examine a retailer facing a stochastic lead time for order fulfillment. We characterize a replenishment policy that is based on the classical (Q,R) policy and that allows for releasing emergency orders in response to the order progress information. We show that the optimal structure of this policy is given by a sequence of threshold values dependent on order progress information. In a numerical Study we evaluate the cost savings due to this improved replenishment policy.

However, the benefits of sharing information can vary depending on the supply chain structure and its operational characteristics. Most of the existing research has studied the impact of sharing downstream information (e.g., a manufacturer sharing information with its suppliers). We evaluate the benefits of sharing upstream yield information (e.g., a supplier sharing information with the manufacturer) in a two-stage serial supply chain in which the supplier has multiple internal processes and is faced with uncertain Output due to yield losses. We are interested in determining when the sharing of the supplier's information is most beneficial to the manufacturer. After proposing an order-up-to type heuristic policy, we perform a detailed computational study and observe that this information is most beneficial when the supplier's yield variance is high and when end-customer demand variance is low. We also find that the manufacturer's backorder-to-holding cost ratio has little, if any, impact on the usefulness of information.

Depending on the assortment of the firms and the substitution behavior of the customer, either a product is sold to the customer or the sale is lost. We consider the cooperation of independent producers that offer a combined set of products to their customers. Producers use discounted price contracts to manage the exchange of products among themselves. We propose an analytical model that enables us to determine the characteristics of firms and their products that would facilitate a beneficial cooperation. We conclude that a cooperation between symmetric single-product firms is always beneficial, whereas threshold-type criteria should be satisfied so that assortment-based cooperation is beneficial for asymmetric firms. We also show that commonality in product assortments of cooperating firms has adverse effects on the benefit from cooperation. For the most general problem setting, we propose a method to determine the set of firms that should cooperate and set the parameters of the contract among the members of cooperation in such a way that each member of the cooperation is better off. We use a numerical study to draw insights on the conditions for which our cooperation scheme is beneficial in the most general problem setting.

In this model, a firm selling through the traditional supply chain of wholesaler and retailer opens a direct channel to the customer through Internet sales. Because both channels have their respective advantages, the manufacturer is attracted to this business model. However, it also leads to channel conflict, with the retailer feeling threatened by direct competition. One way of eliminating the possibility of this channel conflict, where the retailer is allowed to add value to the product to differentiate its offering to the customers, is proposed in this paper. The retailer is also given full authority to make pricing decisions. This paper presents a model, under this scenario, of obtaining optimum pricing decisions by both parties, the amount of value added by the retailer, and the manufacturer's wholesale price to the retailer. Our model incorporates information asymmetry, where the manufacturer has incomplete information about the retailer's cost of adding value. We obtain closed-form contracts with incomplete information and compare them with those with complete channel coordination. We also develop a number of managerial guidelines and identify future research topics.

This is particularly a problem with products that contain electronic components that sometimes have life spans of only two years. The cost of mitigating component obsolescence, which may require redesigning the product, is often considerable. Thus, prudent product design necessitates the selection of electronic components and product architecture, considering the cost of mitigating an obsolete design and other costs related to the design and manufacture of a product. Accordingly, we develop and analyze a model that shows how a product design can be effectively tailored to a particular product's life cycle.

Our analysis is relevant for managing slow-moving perishable products with fixed lot sizes and expiration dates of a week or less. We evaluate two supply chain structures. In the first structure, referred to as decentralized information sharing, the retailer shares its demand, inventory, and ordering policy with the supplier, yet both facilities make their own profit-maximizing replenishment decisions. In the second structure, centralized control, incentives are aligned and the replenishment decisions are coordinated. The latter supply chain structure corresponds to the industry practices of company-owned stores or vendor-managed inventory. We measure the value of information and value of centralized control as the marginal improvement in expected profits that a supply chain achieves relative to the case when no information is shared and decision making is decentralized. Key assumptions of our model include stochastic demand, lost sales, and fixed order quantities. We establish the importance of information sharing and centralized control in the supply chain and identify conditions under which benefits are realized. As opposed to previous work on the value of information, the major benefit in our setting is driven by the supplier's ability to provide the retailer with fresher product. By isolating the benefit by firm, we show that sharing information is not always Pareto-improving for both supply chain partners in the decentralized setting.

This paper considers a periodic-review inventory system consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, where the manufacturer introduces new and improved products over an infinite planning horizon using the solo-roll strategy. We consider two scenarios: (1) the manufacturer does not share the upstream information about new-product introduction with the retailer and (2) the manufacturer shares the information. For each scenario, we first derive the decentralized ordering policy and the system-optimal ordering policy with given cost parameters. We then devise an optimal supply chain contract that coordinates the inventory system. We demonstrate that when the inventory system is coordinated, information sharing improves the performance of both supply chain entities. However, this may not be true if the inventory system is not coordinated. We also show that under the optimal contract, the manufacturer has no incentive to mislead the retailer about new-product information in the information-sharing model. When demand variability increases, information sharing adds more benefits to the coordinated supply chain. Our research provides insights about coordinating product, financial, and information flows in supply chains with product rollover.

We establish the existence and uniqueness of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for the retailer game and study how a supplier can coordinate the system to achieve the best performance. Our main conclusions are as follows: First, a buyback contract can be used to coordinate retailers competing on both price and inventory in a sense that optimal retail prices and inventory levels arise as the Pareto-dominant equilibrium. With symmetric retailers, the system optimum arises as the unique symmetric equilibrium. Second, the particular type of competition experienced by retailers (price versus inventory competition) affects the characteristics of the contract. Specifically, strong price competition leads to a coordination mechanism with a positive buyback rate, where the supplier subsidizes retailers for leftover inventories; however, strong inventory competition leads to a negative buyback rate, where retailers are punished for overstocking. Using a linear expected demand function, we further explore the impact of system parameters on the coordination contract and the competitive equilibrium. We also find that the performance of the supplier's optimal contract is asymptotic to the system optimal coordination contract as competition becomes fierce.

The objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. Obtaining an efficient algorithm for an optimum k-unit cyclic solution (k >= 1) has been a longstanding open problem. For both single-gripper and dual-gripper cells, the approximation algorithms in this paper provide the best-known performance guarantees (obtainable in polynomial time) for an optimal cyclic solution. We provide two algorithms that have a running time linear in the number of machines: for single-gripper cells (respectively, dual-gripper cells), the performance guarantee is 9/7 (respectively, 3/2). The domain considered is free-pickup cells with constant intermachine travel time. Our structural analysis is an important step toward resolving the complexity status of finding an optimal cyclic solution in either a single-gripper or a dual-gripper cell. We also identify optimal cyclic solutions for a variety of special cases. Our analysis provides production managers valuable insights into the schedules that maximize productivity for both single-gripper and dual-gripper cells for any combination of processing requirements and physical parameters.

The Internet, the adoption of new information technologies, and other market forces are driving a new wave of research in revenue management. At the same time, more and more industries are adapting the tools of revenue management to their needs. Promising research directions are more sophisticated models of consumer behavior, more general models and understanding of rivalry, and more general pricing mechanisms. These are important issues for today's revenue managers and promising areas for both theoretical and empirical research.

This behavior is seen in industries ranging from fashion retail to tour packages and baked goods. A number of authors have addressed the markdown management problem in which a seller seeks to determine the optimal sequence of discounts to maximize the revenue from a fixed stock of perishable goods. However, merchants who consistently use markdown policies risk training customers to "wait for the sale." We investigate models in which the decision to sell inventory at a discount will change the future expectations of customers and hence their buying behavior. We show that, in equilibrium, a single-price policy is optimal if all consumers are strategic and demand is known to the seller. Relaxing any of these conditions can lead to a situation in which a two-price markdown policy is optimal. We show using numerical simulation that if customers update their expectations of availability over time, then optimal sales limit policies can evolve in a complex fashion.

The seller may limit the availability of the product (that is, ration) in the second (clearance) period. Some customers are strategic and respond to the firm's decisions by timing their purchases. When capacity is nonconstraining and the seller has pricing flexibility, we show that rationing in the clearance period cannot improve revenue. However, when prices are fixed in advance, rationing can improve revenue. In the latter case, we conduct a detailed analysis for linear and exponential demand curves and derive explicit expressions for optimal rationing levels. We find that the policy of doing the better of not restricting availability at the clearance price or not offering the product at the clearance price is typically near optimal. Our analysis also suggests that rationing-although sometimes offering considerable benefit over allowing unrestricted availability in the clearance period-may allow the seller to obtain only a small fraction of the optimal revenue when the prices are chosen optimally without rationing. We extend the analysis to cases where the capacity is constraining and obtain similar results.

If the initial supply is not too large, consumers have no incentive to delay their purchases to get a lower price at the average inventory prevailing at any time.

We propose, analyze, and compute solutions for a model that is more general than other models reported in the revenue management literature to date. In particular, previous models typically consider only three or four of five key revenue management features that we have purposely built into our model: (1) pricing, (2) resource allocation, (3) dynamic competition, (4) an explicit network, and (5) uncertain demand. Illustrative realizations of the abstract problem we study are those of airline revenue management and service provision by companies facing resource constraints. Under fairly general regularity conditions, we prove existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for dynamic oligopolistic service network competition described by our model. We also show, for an appropriate notion of regularity, that competition leads to the underpricing of network services, a finding numerically illustrated by an example of intermediate size. Our proposed algorithm can be implemented using well-known off-the-shelf commercial software.

However, studies have shown that a less visible but rapidly growing segment of the service sector comprises firms that provide business functions to other businesses. The sector covers tasks such as payroll processing, procurement, and information systems management, as well as business consulting, technical support, call center operations, and software development. Firms may choose to purchase, rather than perform, these business functions to reduce costs, to mitigate risk, or simply to focus on their processes that provide marketplace differentiation. Transferring a business function from within a firm to an Outside supplier is often called "outsourcing"; when the supplier provides the service from a lower-cost country, it is called "offshoring." The risks and benefits of outsourcing to the firm purchasing a business service have been studied in some detail by both academics and consultants. In this paper, we outline revenue management issues faced by business service providers and describe some new opportunities for the use of analytic methods in the service science sector.

One challenge to systematic service innovation is the interdisciplinary nature of service, integrating technology, business, social, and client (demand) innovations. This paper describes the emergence of service science, a new interdisciplinary area of study that aims to address the challenge of becoming more systematic about innovating in service.

First, we operationally define and discuss the concept of customer experience. In this context, we propose a reframing of the strategic role of operations strategy as one of choreographing experience-centric services. We then introduce the concept of services as destinations as an emerging business model for classifying experiential service strategies. Our conceptual typology of experience-based strategies uses two dimensions: (1) the depth of use of experience as a source of value creation, ranging from brand experience to the services as a destinations business model, and (2) the degree of integration of experience internally within the firm. Using this conceptual typology, we develop five propositions and use multiple cases to illustrate firms' use of these experience strategies. Laying the groundwork for future research, we highlight insights from the qualitative, multiple-case data as they pertain to service operations strategy and the business model that employs services as destinations. A number of questions for further research are suggested.

In this paper we argue that new service development success results from building a competence in the management of service development resources and routines. We conceptualize new service development competence as a multidimensional, second-order latent construct that is represented by a system of four interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) formalized new service development processes, (2) market acuity, (3) new service development strategy, and (4) information technology use and experience. We hypothesize that the growth of new service development competence is related to improved new service development performance. Using structural equations modeling, we analyze survey data from 166 retail banks and report three key empirical findings. First, we show that the four hypothesized dimensions are statistically significant in defining new service development competence. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom in new product development, we find that formalized processes play a lesser role in the success of new service development compared with the other three dimensions. Instead, market acuity-which captures the firm's ability to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers' evolving needs and wants-was the most important new service development competence indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the positive effect of new service development competence on new service development performance and show that new service development competence is also significantly related to business-level performance. Together, our empirical results suggest that complementary benefits arise from the adoption of a more holistic approach to the management of new service development at the program level.

Managing these deposits is an important and complex inventory problem for two reasons. First, Federal Reserve regulations require that depository institutions hold certain amounts of such deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks to satisfy statutory reserve requirements against customers' transaction accounts (demand deposits and other checkable deposits). Second, some inventory of such deposits is essential for banks to operate one of their core lines of business: furnishing payment services to households and firms. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on such deposits used to satisfy statutory reserve requirements, banks seek to minimize their inventory of such deposits. In 1994, the banking industry introduced a new inventory management tool for such deposits, the retail deposit sweep program, which avoids the statutory requirement by reclassifying transaction deposits as savings deposits. This is an interesting inventory problem for fungible items, where the conversion process is reversible. We examine two methods for operating such sweeps programs within the limits of Federal Reserve regulations, and we develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to implement one such method, the threshold method.

This paper will show that there is no single answer. For the simple but generic situation of two (strictly pooled or unpooled) server groups, it will provide (1) insights and approximate formulae, (2) numerical support, and (3) general conclusions for the waiting-time effect of pooling. For a single call type, this effect is clearly positive, as represented by a pooling factor. With multiple job types, however, the effect is determined by both a pooling and a mix factor. Due to the mix factor, this effect might even be negative. In this case, it is also numerically illustrated that an improvement of both the unpooled and the strictly pooled scenario can be achieved by simple overflow or threshold scenarios. The results are of both practical and theoretical interest: practical for awareness of this negative effect, the numerical orders, and practical scenarios in call centers, and theoretical for further research in more complex situations.

An abundance of literature has already been published on call centers. Here, we want to focus on centers that would typically occur in business-to-business environments; these are call centers that handle many types of calls but where the arrival rate for each type is low. To find an optimal configuration, the integrality of the decision variables is a much more important issue than for larger call centers. The present paper proposes an approach that uses elements of combinatorial optimization to find optimal configurations. We develop an approximation method for the evaluation of the service performance. Next, we search for the minimum-cost configuration subject to service-level constraints using a branch-and-bound algorithm. What is at stake is to find the right balance between gains resulting from the economies of scale of pooling and the higher cost or cross-trained agents. The article shows that in most cases this method significantly decreases the staffing cost compared with configurations with only cross-trained or dedicated operators.

Research has documented the reality of retail price dispersion, but little is known about how retail markups, in particular, are related to service quality and product attributes. For example, do Internet retailers deliver superior service in return for high markups? Do product characteristics affect the relationship between service and markups for retailers? To examine these issues, we first developed a model of Internet retail profitability that separates revenues and costs related to sales from other profit sources. This framework allowed us to position our work alongside the extant literature about Internet retailing. Moreover, it led us to synthesize service quality dimensions found in Internet retailing studies. We subsequently developed a critical-event study based on the profit model and the synthesis of service quality dimensions to delineate service aspects that retailers should emphasize to address buyers' utility. Finally, we collected data from Internet purchases across retailers to isolate markup-service quality trade-offs along our delineated service aspects. We find that high markups are associated with superior performance across service quality dimensions. Furthermore, this trade-off becomes more acutely defined when products with variable popularity are transacted.

In the latter approach, appointment intervals are adjusted to match the consultation time characteristics of different patient classes. Our simulation results indicate that new appointment systems that utilize interval adjustment for patient class are successful in improving doctors' idle time, doctors' overtime and patients' waiting times without any trade-offs. Best performing appointment systems are identified for different clinic environments characterized by walk-ins, no-shows, the percentage of new patients, and the ratio of the mean consultation time of new patients to the mean consultation time of return patients. As a result, practical guidelines are developed for managers who are responsible for designing appointment systems.

We apply, refine, and interpret these theories to determine how work should be allocated between the consultant and the client and the corresponding pricing under different contractual relationships that occur in this industry. We find that, with a pricing schedule that relates the fee adjustment to the self-service level and one party's ownership of the residual right to specify the workload allocation, the client underinvests her efforts in the service coproduction process, whereas the consultant overinvests his efforts, resulting in an inefficient process. In addition, to improve overall process efficiency, we show that the more productive party should own the residual right to respecify the self-service level when the final service need emerges. Our results, as well as interview data from experienced consultants, provide insights into the causes of inefficient service delivery processes and offer direction for achieving better efficiency through contract design and pricing schedules.

The key findings are that, although feedback loops, accumulation processes, and delays exist and are widespread in operations management, often these phenomena are ignored completely or not considered appropriately. Hence, it is reasoned why system dynamics is well suited as an approach for many operations management studies, and it is shown how system dynamics theory can be used to explain, analyze, and understand such phenomena in operations management. The discussion is based on a literature review and on conceptual considerations, with examples of operations management studies based on system dynamics. Implications of using this theory include the necessary re-framing of some operations management issues and the extension of empirical studies by dynamic modeling and simulation. The value of the paper lies in the conceptualization of the link between system dynamics and operations management, which is discussed on the level of theory.

To address this gap in the literature, we conduct a longitudinal case study of a manufacturing facility belonging to a division of a Fortune 1000 discrete manufacturing firm as it seeks to transition from mass production to mass customization. We empirically identify five factors hindering the mass production-to-mass customization transition within the research site and articulate five corresponding generalizations explaining how and why these hindrance factors relate to the mass production-to-mass customization transition hazard beyond the research site (i.e., how and why the five hindrance factors, in general, threaten the likelihood of a successful mass production-to-mass customization transition). We then theoretically validate the five hindrance factors and corresponding generalizations by mapping them onto the antecedents and tenets of structural inertia theory. We conclude with a brief discussion of the scientific and pragmatic significance of the findings and highlight opportunities for future research.

In such scenarios, there is a trade-off between the costs of obtaining information and the benefits that accrue to the owners of such information. There are also various ways in which the missing information can be obtained or inferred. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of obtaining information via the classical mechanism design approach, which relies on the information available before the contracts are designed, with that of an "audit-based" approach, which relies on the information obtained after the fact. In our model, a single buyer (the Stackelberg leader) wishes to procure a package of products or services from various competing suppliers that possess private cost information. We allow for arbitrary cost and revenue functions and can incorporate multiple cost and revenue drivers. We show how the buyer can optimize her profit and at the same time coordinate the channel by using a contract scheme involving auctions, audits, and profit sharing. We also examine the behavior of this mechanism when the supplier can exert effort to reduce cost but the cost of effort cannot be verified. We propose several mechanisms for different precontract informational scenarios and compare their performance.

In this paper, we study the role of stockless (i.e., zeroinventory) operations in online retailing by a considering duopoly competition in which two retailers compete to maximize profit by jointly optimizing their pricing and inventory decisions. In our model, the retailers are allowed to choose either an in-stock policy or stockless operations with a discounted price. We first present the characteristics and properties of the equilibrium. We then demonstrate that the traditional outcome of asymmetric Bertrand competition is observed under head-to-head competition. However, when the two firms choose different operational policies, with corresponding optimal pricing, they can share the market under certain conditions. Finally, we report interesting observations on the interaction between pricing and inventory decisions obtained from an extensive computational study.

We find that when the spot market demand is small, the supplier that has forward contracts has a higher incentive to invest in expanding the spot market. When the spot market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making the spot market more prevalent. We show that a supplier with forward contracts benefits from the existence of the spot market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand. We find that suppliers producing only for the spot market gain from working in industries where contracted demand and spot market demand are positively correlated, whereas suppliers that have forward contracts benefit from working in industries with a negative correlation between demands, since it allows them to better manage risk. In addition, both total industry supply and spot market supply are higher in industries where demands are negatively correlated.

These reports are used to determine the timing of coordination activities that remove faults. We show that under an optimal policy, coordination should be performed only if a "threshold" fault count has been exceeded. We apply the policy to software development processes and compare the management of those projects under different development conditions. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate how the fault threshold policy needs to be adjusted to changes in system complexity, team skill, development environment, and project schedule. Moreover, we compare the optimal fault threshold policy to an optimal release-based policy. The release-based policy does not take into account fault data and is easier to administer. The comparisons help to define the range of project parameters for which observing fault data can provide significant benefits for managing a software project.

European distribution centers are responsible for the distribution of a manufacturer's (mostly Asian or American) products over customers in a large part of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, often with strict service-level agreements. In total, 65 physical warehouses, containing 140 European, Asian, and American European distribution center operations, in combination with different outsourcing relations (own-account, dedicated outsourced, and public outsourced), were benchmarked in 2000 and monitored over the period 2000 - 2004. We conclude that both in 2000 and 2004, European warehouses are more efficient than Asian and American warehouses, and outsourced operations (particularly public warehouses) are more efficient than own-account operations. Over the period 2000 - 2004, efficiency appears to have declined substantially; the most distinct differences are to be found among public outsourced warehouses and, because many European distribution center warehouse operations of European origin are run by public service providers, among European warehouses. This decline in efficiency also led to a decline in productivity, in spite of the fact that overall the available technology has improved. We conjecture potential causes for this decline.

We study the potential use of a flexible backup supplier as an emergency response to accurate lead-time information arriving at (or close after) the beginning of the demand interval and well after an original order with the stochastic lead-time supplier has been placed. The emergency response decisions involve whether to order and how much from the flexible backup supplier, with the objective of minimizing the cost of meeting demand. We derive the optimal emergency-response policy and clearly outline its implications on the optimized safety lead time of the original order placement and on the cost of meeting demand. We examine the impact on the use of the flexible backup supplier of factors like the arrival time of accurate lead-time information and the response lead time of the backup supplier. We further study the potential benefits of the use of the flexible backup supplier in a dual role: as one of the two suppliers in a redundant supply system assigned to originally meet the demand and as an emergency response to later-arriving lead-time information. Our numerical studies illustrate the benefits from the use of the flexible backup supplier as an emergency response, but for reasonable purchase premiums and short lead times of flexible backup supply options, their use in a dual (regular and emergency response) role often leads to improved performance over safety lead-time single and uncertain leadtime supplier-replenishment strategies. The benefits of the backup supply options are accentuated the higher the lead-time uncertainty of the stochastic lead-time supplier is.

An important issue in implementing a vendor managed inventory scheme is the contracting terms that dictate the ownership of the inventory and the responsibility of inventory replenishment decisions. Thus the performance of a vendor managed system crucially depends on these terms and on how inventory-related costs are shared in a supply chain. We consider a system where a manufacturer supplies a single product to a retailer who faces random demand in a competitive market. The retailer incurs a fixed cost per order, inventory holding cost, and a penalty cost for a stockout (unsatisfied demand is back-ordered). Further, the manufacturer incurs a penalty cost when there is a stockout at the retailer and a fixed replenishment cost. We assume that the players are rational and act noncooperatively. We compare the performance of retailer managed inventory systems, where the retailer places orders and makes replenishment decisions, with vendor managed inventory systems, wherein the vendor or manufacturer makes inventory and replenishment decisions. Specifically, in the vendor managed inventory system, we propose and evaluate holding cost subsidy-type contracts on inventories offered by the retailer to improve system performance. We evaluate this contract in the context of three widely used inventory systems-deterministic economic order quantity, continuous review (Q, r) policies, and periodic review policies-and show when such contracts may improve channel performance.

There is no alternative routing. In a flexible manufacturing system, each manufacturing operation can often be performed on several machines. Therefore, with automated equipment, the capacity of a machine to perform certain operations is not independent of the capacity of other machines. Often, however, operations managers can use a route-independent answer to production planning questions. For example, how much can be produced of a certain part type and when are important capacity questions in business negotiations, when the detailed routing and scheduling are not yet of interest or cannot be known. This paper provides a mathematical model for the route-independent analysis of the capacity of flexible manufacturing systems based on a concept of operation types. An example is provided both to illustrate the use of operation types and to highlight the differences between the traditional route-dependent and the proposed route-independent formulations of capacity constraints. Some computational results are also given. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is developed to analyze the feasibility of production plans when production requirements and machine capacities can change.

LEO satellites typically complete a revolution around the Earth in less than four hours at an altitude of a few hundred miles and are part of the critical infrastructure for natural resource management, crop yield estimation, meteorology, flood control, communication, and space research. Because these satellites are quite expensive to launch and operate, utilizing them in the best possible manner is of paramount importance for the agencies that own them. A ground station provides support time to a satellite to perform a variety of tasks when the satellite is visible to the station over a prespecified planning horizon; the payoff from providing such support is a function of the support time. When two or more satellites pass over the ground station, their visibility time windows may overlap. Thus, under overlapping visibilities, a relevant problem is that of scheduling ground station support time for each satellite with the objective of maximizing the total utility generated from supporting the satellites. We propose four basic scheduling models to address a variety of scenarios and investigate their computational complexities. For each model, we also identify special cases that are polynomially solvable.

The market consists of two customer segments with different preferences and is characterized by positive network effects. The commercial firm makes product and pricing decisions to maximize its profit. The open source developers make product decisions to maximize the weighted sum of the segments' consumer surplus, in addition to their intrinsic motivation. The more importance open source developers attach to consumer surplus, the more effort they put into developing software features. Even if consumers do not end up adopting the open source product, it can act as a credible threat to the commercial firm, forcing the firm to lower its prices. If the open source developers' intrinsic motivation is high enough, they will develop software regardless of eventual market dynamics. If the open source product is available first, all participants are better off when the commercial and open source products are compatible. However, if the commercial firm can enter the market first, it can increase its profits and gain market share by being incompatible with its open source competitor, even if customers can later switch at zero cost. This first-mover advantage does not arise because users are "locked in," but because the commercial firm deploys a "divide and conquer" strategy to attract early adopters and exploit late adopters. To capitalize on its first-mover advantage, the commercial firm must increase its development investment to improve its product features.

Opening the source code to a software product often implies that consumers would not pay for the software product itself. However, revenues may be generated from complementary products. A software firm may be willing to open the source code to its software if it stands to build a network for its complementary products. The rapid network growth is doubly crucial in open source development, in which the users of the firm's products are also contributors of code that translates to future quality improvements. To determine whether or not to open the source, a software firm must jointly optimize prices for its various products while simultaneously managing its product quality network size, and employment strategy. Whether or not potential gains in product quality, network size, and labor savings are sufficient to justify opening the source code depends on product and demand characteristics of both the software and the complementary product, as well as on the cost and productivity of in-house developers relative to open source contributors. This paper investigates these crucial elements to allow firms to reach the optimal decision in choosing between the open and closed source models.

Our analysis builds on the previous studies that describe alternate ways in which a new product might open a new market and ultimately encroach on an existing market. Consider the example of cell phones: They opened up a new detached market by meeting the customer need for mobility, a need very different from the traditional attribute of reception quality. By meeting an important detached need, a new product can sell at a high price, even though it might be woefully deficient with regard to the traditional performance dimension (the reception/coverage of early cell phones was sorely lacking). A person who is a high-end customer for the old product initially despises the new product as a replacement for the old one but might simultaneously be one of the first customers for the new product because it fills the detached-market need. Over time, the new product improves along the traditional dimension (e.g., cell phone reception/coverage has dramatically improved), and eventually it becomes a replacement for the old product, encroaching from the lower end upward (the first customers to drop their landlines have been lower-end customers such as students and apartment dwellers, whereas higher-end business customers still have landlines in their offices). We call this the detached-market form of low-end encroachment and show how it helps explain the conundrum of an expensive "disruptive" innovation. We go on to relate our results to the finding that "willingness to cannibalize" is a key factor in an incumbent firm's growth and survival, and to the "blue ocean strategy.".

We develop a simple, stochastic model of a firm making investment decisions in process improvement. Our analysis offers several interesting insights into investments in process improvement. First, early investment in process improvement results in valuable knowledge, which helps increase the value of the option to invest in process improvement in future periods. This may motivate a firm to invest in process improvements as early as possible. Second, it may be optimal for a firm to stop investing when such investments do not create enough value in the later stages of the investment horizon. Third, although one would expect the state of a firm's process relative to that of other firms to impact a firm's decision to invest in process improvement, this study finds that the impetus is conditional and identifies these conditions. Finally, in such an environment, the delay of investment in process improvement incurs an opportunity cost for a firm, and we show that the traditional net present value rule must incorporate this opportunity cost and the knowledge-induced change in future option values to lead to a correct investment decision.

A bank is viewed as a collection of human, technology, and capital resources. Labor-saving technologies are represented by two categories of technology resources-information technologies and patented in-house process innovations. The estimation of a stochastic frontier manpower-requirement function shows that, whereas information technology resources have a direct impact on efficiency in the use of human resources, in-house process innovations have an indirect impact through spillovers. The reduction in labor costs resulting from a more efficient use of human resources is more than enough to cover the required increase in information technology expenditures. This cost-reducing impact is stronger for firms currently employing a lower level of information technologies. The empirical findings also suggest a complementary relationship between information technologies and spillovers of in-house process innovations. The empirical framework proposed in this study can help decision makers determine the optimal input mix of technology and human resources.

Intraorganizational communication capabilities of certain information systems can help overcome these barriers. However, the extent to which certain systems are promoted as communication tools depends largely on management's interpretation of their usefulness, which in turn may be largely dependent on operational context and managerial experience. We use a controlled experimental approach to study how these issues interact to impact managerial assessments of resource planning systems. Results show that managers value the communication capabilities of resource planning systems more so in highly task-interdependent contexts and that these assessments are still more positive among managers with greater supervisory experience. As a result, these findings pose direct implications regarding the management support of technology use.

Corporate websites have become an important point of contact with customers for many companies. Service has been described as one of the most important attributes for online business to influence traffic and sales. However, more research is needed to understand how Web-based technological capabilities of services affect customer satisfaction. In this paper, we propose viewing the interface between online buyers and sellers through the lens of service management to identify possible determinants of online customer satisfaction. A company's website is considered its electronic service delivery system. We look at this electronic service delivery system from its process point of view. Our findings indicate that as the electronic service delivery system process improves, a customer's perception of the website's ease of use increases, leading to increased service value and perceived control over the process, which increases customer satisfaction. The research provides evidence that the technological capabilities embedded in the website processes are an important factor in determining service quality and ultimately online customer satisfaction.

We consider a supply chain with two participants, who face interdependent losses resulting from supply chain disruptions such as terrorist strikes and natural hazards. The Harsanyi-Selten-Nash bargaining framework is used to model the supply chain participants' choice of risk mitigation investments. The bargaining approach allows a framing of both joint financing of mitigation activities before the fact and loss-sharing net of insurance payouts after the fact. The disagreement outcome in the bargaining game is assumed to be the result of the corresponding non-cooperative game. We describe an incentive-compatible contract that leads to First Best investment and equal "gain" for all players, when the solution is "interior" (as it almost certainly is in practice). A supplier that has superior security practices (i.e., is inherently safer) exploits its informational advantage by extracting an "information rent" in the usual spirit of incomplete information games. We also identify a special case of this contract, which is robust to moral hazard. The role of auditing in reinforcing investment incentives is also examined.

It incorporates the concepts of hidden actions, hidden information, and misaligned incentives, and conveys messages about power, trust, and reputation. The game depicts the adventures of Acme, the brand owner of a product manufactured by an outsourced supply chain. Through a series of negotiations, Acme attempts to influence its partners (two suppliers and two service providers) by distributing its procurement "spend." These partners, in turn, sway each other via side payments. To simulate the non-linear shifts in power that occur as outsourcing increases, we represent decision-making by a voting scheme with uneven vote allocations. This paper analyzes a database of game results to reveal behavioral factors that can undermine conspicuous win-win process improvements. For instance, preferences can be sensitive to the sequence in which the alternatives are encountered; decision-makers might value not only their own rewards, but also fairness in the allocation of total gains; and effectiveness of negotiation tactics will vary with community norms of acceptable behavior. Along the way we extend the political economics literature about power in block-based voting by proposing a heuristic approach for incorporating voter preferences.

For example, many retailers in the grocery industry will agree to broaden their assortments only if the manufacturer agrees to pay slotting fees for the new products. We investigate the role played by slotting fees in coordinating the assortment decisions in a supply chain. To do so, we study a single-retailer, single-manufacturer supply chain, where the retailer decides what assortment to offer to end customers. Double marginalization results in a discrepancy between the retailer's optimal assortment and the assortment that maximizes total supply chain profits. We consider a payment scheme that is analogous to slotting fees used in the grocery industry: the manufacturer pays the retailer a per-product fee for every product offered by the retailer in excess of a certain target level. We show that, if the wholesale price is below some threshold level, this payment scheme induces the retailer to offer the supply-chain-optimal assortment and makes both parties better off.

In this paper, we investigate a double-bid business model in which the consumers can bid twice in the NYOP channel, and compare it with the single-bid case. We also study the impact of adding a retailer-own list-price channel on the optimal reserve prices. This paper focuses on achieving some basic understanding on the potential gain of adding a second bid option to a single-bid system and on the potential benefits of adding a list-price channel by the NYOP retailer. We show that a double-bid scenario can outperform a single-bid scenario in both single-channel and dual-channel situations. The optimal reserve price in the double-bid scenario is no less than that in the single-bid case. Furthermore, the addition of a retailer-own list-price channel could push up the reserve prices in both single-bid and double-bid scenarios.

The supplier receives a set of orders from the customer at the beginning of a planning horizon. The supplier needs to process all the orders at a single production line, pack the completed orders to form delivery batches, and deliver the batches to the customer. Each order has a weight, and the total weight of the orders packed in a batch must not exceed the capacity of the delivery batch. Each delivery batch incurs a fixed distribution cost. The problem is to find jointly a schedule for order processing and a way of packing completed orders to form delivery batches such that the total distribution cost (or equivalently, the number of delivery batches) is minimized subject to the constraint that a given customer service level is guaranteed. We consider two customer service constraints-meeting the given deadlines of the orders; or requiring the average delivery lead time of the orders to be within a given threshold. Several problems of the model with each of those constraints are considered. We clarify the complexity of each problem and develop fast heuristics for the NP-hard problems and analyze their worst-case performance bounds. Our computational results indicate that all the heuristics are capable of generating near optimal solutions quickly for the respective problems.

In this context, we observe that the outside option, which represents the value that a given consumer associates with choosing not to purchase the newsvendor's product, may be interpreted as a search cost. Taking into consideration whether consumers' valuations differ on either one dimension of heterogeneity or on both dimensions, we develop a framework for classifying newsvendor models that incorporate demand-management effects. In particular, we show that this framework includes both the newsvendor model with price-dependent demand and the newsvendor model with endogenous demand as special cases. In addition to making a conceptual contribution by developing and drawing insights from this framework, we make technical contributions by providing more general sufficient conditions under which the underlying optimization problems are well behaved.

This paper considers inventory models in which a supplier provides alternative lead times to its customers: a short or a long lead time. Orders from patient customers can be taken by the supplier and included in the next production cycle, while orders from impatient customers have to be satisfied from the on-hand inventory. We denote the action to commit one unit of on-hand inventory to patient or impatient customers as the inventory-commitment decision, and the initial inventory stocking as the inventory-replenishment decision. We first characterize the optimal inventory-commitment policy as a threshold type, and then prove that the optimal inventory-replenishment policy is a base-stock type. Then, we extend our analysis to models to consider cases of a multi-cycle setting, a supply-capacity constraint, and the on-line charged inventory-holding cost. We also evaluate and compare the performances of the optimal inventory-commitment policy and the inventory-rationing policy. Finally, to further investigate the benefits and pitfalls of introducing an alternative lead-time choice, we use the customer-choice model to study the demand gains and losses, known as demand-induction and demand-cannibalization effects, respectively.

Motivating applications include virtual call centers, consisting of geographically dispersed centers, walk-in health clinics, motor vehicle inspection stations, automobile emissions testing stations, and internal service systems. The choice of locations for such facilities influences both the travel cost and waiting times of users. In contrast to most previous research, we explicitly embed both customer travel/connection and delay costs in the objective function and solve the location-allocation problem and choose facility capacities simultaneously. The choice of capacity for a facility that is viewed as a queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times could mean choosing a service rate for the servers (Scenario 1) or choosing the number of servers (Scenario 2). We express the optimal service rate in closed form in Scenario 1 and the (asymptotically) optimal number of servers in closed form in Scenario 2. This allows us to eliminate both the number of servers and the service rates from the optimization problems, leading to tractable mixed-integer nonlinear programs. Our computational results show that both problems can be solved efficiently using a Lagrangian relaxation optimization procedure.

This growth has created powerful contract manufacturers (CMs) in several industries. Achieving a competitive cost position is often a primary motive for outsourcing. Outsourcing influences both the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) and the CM's production levels, and, therefore, through learning-by-doing renders future costs dependent on past outsourcing decisions. As such, outsourcing should not be viewed as a static decision that, once made, is not revisited. We address these considerations by analyzing a two-period game between an OEM and a powerful CM wherein both firms can reduce their production costs through learning-by-doing. We find that partial outsourcing, wherein the OEM simultaneously outsources and produces in-house, can be an optimal strategy. Also, we find that the OEM's outsourcing strategy may be dynamic-i.e., change from period to period. In addition, we find both that the OEM may engage in production for leverage (i.e., produce internally when at a cost disadvantage) and that the CM may engage in low balling. These and other findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of considering learning, the power of the CM, and future periods when making outsourcing decisions.

We formulate the expected inventory cost at this retailer and analyze the properties of the cost function. In particular, we show that the cost function is quasi-convex and therefore can be efficiently optimized to numerically find the optimal order size from the retailer to the supplier. Computational experiments provide additional insight into the problem. In addition, we introduce an effective approximation of the cost function. Our approximation can be solved in closed form, which is useful when the model is embedded into more complicated supply chain design or management models.

Theories of performance frontiers and capability progression provide the basis for our hypotheses. Data were collected from 224 U.S. manufacturing plants in industries considered to have potential utilizations of AMTs. A cluster analysis of the data yields a solution that closely resembles a previous AMT utilization taxonomy, including four groups labeled, respectively, as Traditionalists, Generalists, High Investors, and Designers. Significant manufacturing capability differences across these four groups indicate that plants that utilize a broader scope of AMTs enjoy a greater breadth of manufacturing capabilities. The implied capability attainment pattern is consistent with cumulative capability theory. However, the results suggest that cost capability is not included in the capability mix when broad-based AMT utilization is the enabler of capability gains. A post hoc exploration of the AMT groups indicates significant differences in performance across the groups. Collectively, the results extend prior research by providing added insights into the possible rationale and impact of AMT utilization patterns.

A general framework is developed in this paper to describe information flows in an inventory system with information delays. We characterize the sufficient statistics for making optimal decisions. When the ordering cost is linear, the optimality of a state-dependent base-stock policy is established even when information flows are allowed to cross over time. Additional insights into the problem are obtained via a comparison between our models and the models with stochastic order lead times. We also show that inventory can substitute for information and vice versa.

However, many consumers are sophisticated enough to anticipate the availability of upgrades in the future. This creates the possibility that consumers might either postpone purchase or buy early on and never upgrade. In response, many software producers offer special upgrade pricing to old customers in order to mitigate the effects of strategic consumer behavior. We analyze the optimality of upgrade pricing by characterizing the relationship between magnitude of product improvement and the equilibrium pricing structure, particularly in the context of user upgrade costs. This upgrade cost (such as the cost of upgrading complementary hardware or drivers) is incurred by the user when she buys the new version but is not captured by the upgrade price for the software. Our approach is to formulate a game theoretic model where consumers can look ahead and anticipate prices and product qualities while the firm can offer special upgrade pricing. We classify upgrades as minor, moderate or large based on the primitive parameters. We find that at sufficiently large user costs, upgrade pricing is an effective tool for minor and large upgrades but not moderate upgrades. Thus, upgrade pricing is suboptimal for the firm for a middle range of product improvement. User upgrade costs have both direct and indirect effects on the pricing decision. The indirect effect arises because the upgrade cost is a critical factor in determining whether all old consumers would upgrade to a new product or not, and this further alters the product improvement threshold at which special upgrade pricing becomes optimal. Finally, we also analyze the impact of upgrade pricing on the total coverage of the market.

Consumers exhibit inertia when they have an inherent bias to delay purchases. Inertia may induce consumers to wait even when it is optimal to buy immediately. We embed our decision model within a dynamic pricing context. There is a firm that sells a fixed capacity over two time periods to an uncertain number of both rational and inertial consumers. We find that consumer inertia has both positive and negative effects on profits: it decreases demand (in period one) but intensifies competition among consumers for the product (in period two). We show that our model of inertia is consistent with well-established behavioral regularities, such as loss aversion and probability weighting in the sense of prospect theory, and hyperbolic time preferences. We offer practical recommendations for firms to influence the level of consumer inertia. These include offering returns policies (to mitigate potential consumer losses), providing decision aids (to avoid perception errors), and offering flexible payment options (to lower transaction costs).

At the beginning of the selling season, the retailer announces both the price p(h) at which the product will be sold during the selling season and the post-season clearance price p(l) < p(h) for unsold items. We analyze two operating regimes: The "no reservation regime'' allows a buyer either to purchase the product at price ph when he arrives or to enter a lottery to purchase at price p(l) if the product remains unsold. The "reservation regime'' offers each buyer one extra option than the no reservation regime: reserve the product for purchase at the clearance price p(l). If the buyer reserves the product under the reservation regime and if it remains unsold at the end of the selling season, then he is obligated to purchase it at price p(l). We consider a situation in which heterogeneous customers with probabilistic valuation arrive in accord with a Poisson process. We characterize the rational purchasing behavior wherein each arriving customer is strategic; each customer takes other customers' purchasing behavior into consideration. By considering the Nash equilibrium of this game, we show that strategic customer behavior can render the customer to be worse off and the retailer to be better off under the reservation regime, despite the fact that this regime offers one extra option (reservation) to a customer. Hence, more purchasing options do not necessarily benefit customers.

Leases to corporate consumers affect the price of used goods on the second-hand market which in turn affect the buying and leasing behavior of individual consumers. The setting of prices (or volumes) for sale and lease to individual and corporate consumers is a complicated problem for manufacturers. We consider a manufacturer who concurrently sells and leases a finitely durable good to both individual and corporate consumers. The interaction between the manufacturer and consumers is modeled as a dynamic sequential game, where each player seeks to maximize its own payoff over an infinite horizon. We study how the corporate channel substitutability of new goods and used goods and transaction costs in the second-hand market affect the manufacturer's pricing decisions, consumer behavior, and social welfare in the retail market. Making a number of simplifying assumptions, including two-period lifetime for the finitely durable goods, we consider Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the solution concept. We show that the manufacturer can maximize her profit by segmenting consumers according to their willingness to pay. Selling and leasing are the mechanisms used for price discrimination in the retail market. We show that as she leases a larger share of her production to the corporate consumer, (1) the manufacturer does not necessarily have to adjust the optimal selling price of new goods to individual consumers, and the volume of sales of new goods to individual consumers can stay the same; (2) the manufacturer does increase the retail lease price, and the number of individual leases decreases; (3) the net supply of used goods on the market increases, leading to a lower market price for used goods; and (4) more individual consumers are able to participate in the market, and their collective welfare or net utility improves. We also show that as production costs increase the manufacturer increases prices, reducing volumes across all channels. When transaction costs increase, the manufacturer reduces leasing in both corporate and retail channels.

Specifically, we examine three pricing policies: (1) static, state-independent pricing, (2) constant pricing up to a cutoff state, and (3) general state-dependent pricing. We determine properties of each policy, and illustrate numerically the financial gains that the firm can achieve by following each policy as compared with simpler policies. Our main result is that constant pricing up to a cutoff state can dramatically outperform a state-independent policy, while at the same time achieving most of the increase in revenue achievable from general state-dependent pricing. Thus, we find that constant pricing up to a cutoff state presents an attractive tradeoff between ease of implementation and revenue gain. When the costs of policy design and implementation are taken into account, this simple heuristic may actually out-perform general state-dependent pricing in some settings.

Due to certain adverse effects, however, some manufacturers and retailers are contemplating the elimination of their rebate programs. This paper sheds light on the debate about the value of rebate programs by presenting a model for evaluating the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in a competitive environment. Specifically, we consider a two-level supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. Each firm makes three decisions: the regular (wholesale or retail) price, whether or not to offer rebates, and the rebate value should the firm decide to launch a rebate program. We determine the equilibrium of a vertical competition game between the manufacturer (leader) and the retailer (follower), and we provide insights about how competition affects the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in equilibrium.

In this paper, a simulation optimization approach is used to determine optimal rules for a stochastic appointment scheduling problem. This approach allows for the consideration of more variables and factors in modeling this system than in prior studies, providing more flexibility in setting policy under various problem settings and environmental factors. Results show that the dome scheduling rule proposed in prior literature is robust, but practitioners could benefit from considering a flatter, "plateau-dome.'' The plateau-dome scheduling pattern is shown to be robust over many different performance measures and scenarios. Furthermore, because this is the first application of simulation optimization to appointment scheduling, other insights are gleaned that were not possible with prior methodologies.

In this paper, we investigate the implications of uncertain supplier reliability on a firm's sourcing decisions in an environment with stochastic demand. In particular, we characterize specific conditions under which a firm should choose a single versus multiple supplier sourcing strategy. In an environment with both uncertain demand and supply, we characterize the total order quantity, the number of suppliers selected for order placement, and the allocation of the total order quantity among these selected suppliers. For deeper managerial insight, we also examine the sensitivity of the optimal sourcing decisions to interactions between uncertainties in product demand and supply reliability. We show that sourcing from a single supplier is an optimal strategy for environments characterized by high levels of demand uncertainty or high salvage values. A numerical analysis based on data obtained from an office products retailer further reinforces our analytical results. In addition, we also find that when minimal order quantities are imposed, there are situations where it is not optimal to place an order with the lowest cost supplier.

Such regulation puts an economic burden on firms, while creating fairness concerns and potentially even missing its primary target: environmental benefits. This research discusses the economic and environmental impacts of extended producer responsibility type of legislation and identifies efficiency conditions. It is shown that the right policy would (i) make producers responsible for their own waste to avoid fairness concerns and (ii) favor eco-design producers to create stronger environmental benefits. Furthermore, the efficiency of take-back systems is also driven by environmental classification of products, industry structure, and end-user willingness to participate in take-back programs.

In this paper, we examine the influence of EPR policy parameters on product design and coordination incentives in a durable product supply chain. We model a manufacturer supplying a remanufacturable product to a customer over multiple periods. The manufacturer invests in two design attributes of the product that impact costs incurred by the supply chain-performance, which affects the environmental impact of the product during use, and remanufacturability, which affects the environmental impact post-use. Consistent with the goals of EPR policies, the manufacturer and the customer are required to share the environmental costs incurred over the product's life cycle. The customer has a continuing need for the services of the product and optimizes between the costs of product replacement and the costs incurred during use. We demonstrate how charges during use and post-use can be used as levers to encourage environmentally favorable product design. We analyze the impact of supply chain coordination on design choices and profit and discuss contracts that can be used to achieve coordination, both under symmetric and asymmetric information about customer attributes.

This research provides a first examination of operational managers' experiences with and attitudes about employee well-being and environmental issues, how these factors impact employee well-being and environmental performance, and how the three performance measures interrelate. We use violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and Toxic Release Inventory reports of emissions as proxies for employee well-being and environmental performance. Our findings suggest that operational managers do not (yet) think in sustainability terms. However, employee well-being and environmental performance do interact in a significant way with operational performance. Hence, operational managers would benefit from a more complete understanding of the relationships among the elements of the triple bottom line.

Remanufacturing cost increases as the quality level decreases, and any unused returns may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. Decision variables include the amount to remanufacture each period for each return quality level and the amount of inventory to carry over for future periods for both returns (unremanufactured), and finished remanufactured products. Our model is grounded with data collected at Pitney-Bowes from their mailing systems remanufacturing operations. We derive some analytic properties for the optimal solution in the general case, and provide a simple greedy heuristic to computing the optimal solution in the case of deterministic returns and demand. Under mild assumptions, we find that the firm always remanufactures the exact demand in each period. We also study the value of a nominal quality-grading system in planning production. Based on common industry parameters, we analyze, via a numerical study, the increase in profits observed by the firm if it maintains separate inventories for each quality grade. The results show that a grading system increases profit by an average of 4% over a wide range of parameter values commonly found in the remanufacturing industry; this number increases as the returns volume increases. We also numerically explore the case where there are capacity constraints and find the average improvement of a grading system remains around 4%.

Our key results are as follows: (i) Variable costs drive vertical differentiation. In the presence of significant volume-dependent manufacturing costs, the optimal portfolio contains a mix of vertically and horizontally differentiated products and an increase in the variable cost makes adding vertically differentiated products relatively more profitable; if fixed volume-independent design costs dominate, the portfolio exhibits solely horizontal differentiation. (ii) Horizontal differentiation is the main profit lever, and vertical differentiation brings only a marginal benefit; this is true even when most of the consumers exhibit low willingness to pay for performance, which is often used as an excuse to offer low-end products. (iii) There are more low-quality products than high-quality ones, and market coverage increases when the willingness to pay for performance increases. In summary, the model shows how portfolio composition decisions depend on the product cost structure and the consumer preferences.

When a worker is absent, management must scramble to quickly find a replacement. Usually, the replacement will not be as proficient as the absent worker. This can reduce quality and throughput. We present two assembly line work-systems models (one for lines with Andon and one for lines without Andon) that show one mechanism whereby absenteeism could impact quality and throughput. We exercise these models to provide insights into absenteeism's impact on quality and throughput. While the paper is written in the concrete terms of automotive assembly, the concepts and results apply to manual assembly lines in general.

The operational decisions of interest are the selling price, return policy, and quantity of new product to purchase. We model a single selling season that is split into two periods where the boundary between periods is delineated by the opportunity to recover product returns and resell them. That is, returns in the first period can be recovered and sold in the second period. Returns also arise in the second period, but these may only be salvaged. We first analyze both deterministic and stochastic models, finding that the deterministic results largely carry over to the stochastic case. In addition, our results indicate that the model is quite insensitive to errors in the estimates of the parameter values, except for purchase cost and parameters related to demand. Finally, we perform an analysis on the value of various investments to improve financial performance. Results indicate that investments to reduce the recovery cost of returns or reduce returns uncertainty are minimal, while investments to increase recovery speed, reduce market uncertainty, and reduce the return rate can be quite valuable.

Melons and other types of produce reach their peak value at the time of harvest; product value deteriorates exponentially post-harvest until the product is cooled to dampen the deterioration. Using the product's marginal value of time (MVT), the rate at which the product loses value over time in the supply chain, we show that the appropriate model to minimize lost value in the supply chain is a hybrid of a responsive model from post-harvest to cooling, followed by an efficient model in the remainder of the chain. We also show that these two segments of the supply chain are only loosely linked, implying that little coordination is required across the chain to achieve value maximization. The models we develop also provide insights into the use of a product's MVT to develop supply chain strategies for other perishable products.

We examine the implementation of a supply chain planning process at a consumer electronics company, concentrating on the forecasting approach around which the process revolves. Our analysis focuses on the forecasting process and how it mediates and accommodates the functional biases that can impair the forecast accuracy. We categorize the sources of functional bias into intentional, driven by misalignment of incentives and the disposition of power within the organization, and unintentional, resulting from informational and procedural blind spots. We show that the forecasting process, together with the supporting mechanisms of information exchange and elicitation of assumptions, is capable of managing the potential political conflict and the informational and procedural shortcomings. We also show that the creation of an independent group responsible for managing the forecasting process, an approach that we distinguish from generating forecasts directly, can stabilize the political dimension sufficiently to enable process improvement to be steered. Finally, we find that while a coordination system-the relevant processes, roles and responsibilities, and structure-can be designed to address existing individual and functional biases in the organization, the new coordination system will in turn generate new individual and functional biases. The introduced framework of functional biases (whether those biases are intentional or not), the analysis of the political dimension of the forecasting process, and the idea of a coordination system are new constructs to better understand the interface between operations management and other functions.

The demand at the retailer is a linearly decreasing function of price. The manufacturer sets the wholesale price first, and the retailer sets the retail price after observing the wholesale price. Both players set their prices based on their forecasts of demand. In the make-to-order scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity after observing the actual demand; in the make-to-stock scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity before the demand is realized. In the make-to-order scenario, we show that sharing the forecast unconditionally by the retailer with the manufacturer benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer. We also demonstrate that a side payment contract cannot induce Pareto-optimal information sharing equilibrium, but a discount based wholesale price contract can. The social welfare as well as consumer surplus is higher under the discount contract, compared with under no information sharing. In the make-to-stock scenario, the manufacturer realizes additional benefits in the form of savings in inventory holding and shortage costs when forecasts are shared. If the savings from inventory holding and shortage costs because of information sharing are sufficiently high, then a side payment contract that induces Pareto-optimal information sharing is feasible in the make-to-stock scenario. We also provide additional managerial insights with the help of a computational study.

The OEM provides a demand forecast at the time when the CM must order the long lead-time set of components, but must decide whether or not to provide updated forecasts as a matter of practice. Forecast updates affect the CM's short lead-time purchase decision, and the anticipation of updates may also affect the long lead-time purchase decision. While the OEM and CM both incur lost sales costs, the OEM can decide whether or not to share the overage costs otherwise fully borne by the CM. We investigate when the OEM is better served by committing to provide updated forecasts and/or committing to share overage costs. For a distribution-free, two-stage forecast-update model, we show that (1) the practice of providing forecast updates may be harmful to the OEM and (2) at the OEM's optimal levels of overage risk sharing, the CM undersupplies relative to the supply chain optimal quantity. For a specific forecast-update model, we computationally investigate conditions under which forecast updating and risk sharing are in the best interest of the OEM.

Empirical studies have observed a variety of incentive structures in innovation settings: "time and material contracts" (compensation for executing orders), "downside protection" (target-driven incentives with protection from unexpected risks), and "upside rewards" (additional remuneration for pursuing opportunities). This paper develops a model of incentives in presence of unforeseen events and offers a theoretical prediction of which of the empirically observed incentive structures should be used under which circumstances. The combination of three key influences drives the shape of the best incentive contract. First, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty, or the occurrence of events that cannot possibly be foreseen at the outset. These may force a change in the project's plan, making pure target setting insufficient. Second, fairness concerns dictate that the employee's expected compensation cannot be shifted downward by unforeseen events, because it would cause demotivation, hostility, and defection. Third, management may not be able to observe the detailed actions of the employee (moral hazard) nor whether a positive or negative unforeseen event has occurred (asymmetric information).

The agent's effort is hard to monitor. In addition, the cost of effort is the agent's private information. These impose challenges to the manufacturer in its endeavor to influence the agent's marketing effort provisions and to allocate profit between the two parties. We propose two contract forms. The franchise fee contract is a two-part price schedule specifying a variable wholesale price and a fixed franchise fee. The retail price maintenance contract links the allowed retail price that the agent charges customers with total payment to the manufacturer and sales level. Under information asymmetry, for implementing either contract form, the manufacturer needs to offer a menu of contracts, hoping to invoke the "revelation principle" when the agent picks a certain contract from that menu. We show that the two contract forms perform differently, and each party's preference toward a particular contract form is linked with the total reservation profit level and/or the sales agent's cost type. We provide managerial guidelines for the manufacturer in selecting a better contract form under different conditions.

This research considers a MTO manufacturer who produces a product consisting of several custom parts to be ordered from multiple suppliers. We develop procedures to allocate orders to each supplier for each custom part and calculate the associated replenishment cost as well as the probability of meeting the delivery date, based on the suppliers' jobs on hand, availability, process speed, and defective rate. For a given delivery due date, a frontier of service level and a replenishment cost frontier are created to provide a range of options to meet customer requirements. This method can be further extended to the case when the delivery due date is not fixed and the manufacturer must "crash" its delivery time to compete for customers.

Therefore, we also develop mathematical programs using principles from goal programming and integer programming to refine the portfolio of contracts to more accurately reflect a realistic environment by placing constraints on the available contracts and explicitly considering operational costs.

The throughput of a bucket brigade on discrete work stations may be compromised due to blocking even if workers are sequenced from slowest to fastest. For a given work distribution on the stations we find policies that maximize the throughput of the line. When workers have very different production rates, fully cross-training the workers and sequencing them from slowest to fastest is almost always the best policy. This policy outperforms other policies for most work distributions except for some cases in which limiting the work zones of workers produces higher throughput. In environments where the work can be adjusted across stations, we identify conditions for a line to prevent blocking.

Simulation is a very general methodology for estimating the expected costs, but for estimating the gradient, straightforward finite difference estimators can be inefficient. We demonstrate an alternative approach based on smoothed perturbation analysis (SPA), also known as conditional Monte Carlo. Numerical results and consequent design insights are obtained in determining the optimal control limits for exponentially weighted moving average and Bayes charts. The results indicate that the SPA gradient estimators can be significantly more efficient than finite difference estimators, and that a simulation approach using these estimators provides a viable alternative to other numerical solution techniques for the economic design problem.

In this, the manufacturer announces a co-op advertising policy, i.e., a participation rate that specifies the percentage of the retailer's advertising expenditure that it will provide. In addition, it also announces the wholesale price. In response, the retailer chooses its optimal advertising and pricing policies. We model this supply chain problem as a stochastic Stackelberg differential game whose dynamics follows Sethi's stochastic sales-advertising model. We obtain the condition when offering co-op advertising is optimal for the manufacturer. We provide in feedback form the optimal advertising and pricing policies for the manufacturer and the retailer. We contrast the results with the advertising and price decisions of the vertically integrated channel, and suggest a method for coordinating the channel.

While one leads to unrealistically high prices and profits as products become more substitutable, the results obtained using the other measure are in line with intuition. Using the more appropriate measure of product substitutability, we study the optimal investment mix in flexible and dedicated capacities in both monopoly and oligopoly settings. We find that the optimal investment in manufacturing flexibility tends to decrease as the products become closer substitutes; this is because (1) pricing can be used more effectively to balance supply and demand, and (2) the gains obtained by shifting production to the more profitable product are reduced due to increased correlation between the price potentials of the substitutable products. The value of flexibility always increases with demand variability. We also show that, as long as the optimal investments in dedicated capacity for both products are positive, the optimal expected prices and production quantities do not depend on the cost of the flexible capacity. Manufacturing flexibility simply allows the firm to achieve those expected values with lower capacity, while leading to higher expected profits.

Lifetime buys are one tactic for mitigating the effect of part obsolescence, where a quantity of parts is purchased for the remaining life of a product. We extend prior work that determines optimal lifetime buy quantities for one product with one obsolete part by providing an analytic solution and two simple heuristic policies for the optimal lifetime buy quantities when many parts become obsolete over a product's life cycle. We determine which of our two heuristics is most accurate for different product life cycles, which yields a metaheuristic with increased accuracy. That analysis also reveals critical perspectives in making lifetime buy decisions with nonstationary life-cycle demand patterns.

In this paper we present a classification of IIS based on their operational characteristics. We also propose empirically grounded conceptual analysis and prescriptive frameworks useful for the improvement of certain types of IIS. By conducting statistical analyses of a large sample of claims data from one of the largest property and casualty companies in the United States, we isolate key drivers of service performance and identify preemptive actions that can favorably impact performance metrics. Those results demonstrate the direct operationalization of the proposed frameworks with primary data. Our conceptual analysis, empirical findings, and the prescriptive framework that follow, provide an action plan that can lead to a systemic improvement in the performance of information and customer contact intensive services.

Specifically, we disentangle the distinct effects of satisfaction and switching costs as drivers of retention among self-service customers. Our empirical analysis examines 26,924 multi-channel customers of a nationwide retail bank. We track each customer's channel usage, overall satisfaction, and retention over a 1-year period. We find that, relative to face-to-face service, customers who use self-service channels for a greater proportion of their transactions are either no more satisfied, or less satisfied with the service they receive, depending on the channel. However, we also find that these same customers are predictably less likely to defect to a competitor if they are heavily reliant on self-service channels characterized by high switching costs. Through a mediation model, we demonstrate that, when self-service usage promotes retention, it does so in a way that is consistent with switching costs. As a robustness check, we examine the behavior of channel enthusiasts, who concentrate transactions among specific channels. Relative to more diversified customers, we find that self-service enthusiasts in low switching cost channels defect with greater frequency, while self-service enthusiasts in high switching cost channels are retained with greater frequency.

In the management of call center networks, these partnerships are common and form an integral part of the customer care and marketing strategies in the financial services industry. For a financial services firm, configuring such a call center service network entails determining which partners to select and how to distribute service requests among vendors, while incorporating their capabilities, costs, and revenue-generating abilities. Motivated by a problem facing a Fortune 500 financial services provider, we develop and apply a novel mixed integer programming model for the service network configuration problem. Our tactical decision support model effectively accounts for the firm's costs by capturing the impact of service requirements on vendor staffing levels and seat requirements, and permits imposing call routing preferences and auxiliary service costs. We implemented the model and applied it to data from an industry partner. Results suggest that our approach can generate considerable cost savings and substantial additional revenues, while ensuring high service quality. Results based on test instances demonstrate similar savings and outperform two rule-based methods for vendor assignment.

The question of when and to whom to cross sell is explored using this model. The analysis shows that, under the optimal policies, cross-selling targets may be a function of the operational system state. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of preferred calls, i.e., calls that will always generate a cross-sell attempt. These provide guidelines in segment formation for marketing managers, and lead to a static heuristic policy. Numerical analysis establishes the value of different types of information, and different types of automation available for cross selling. Increased staffing for the same call volume is shown to have a positive and increasing return on revenue generation via cross selling, suggesting the need to staff for lower loads in call centers that aim to be revenue generators. The proposed heuristic leads to near optimal performance in a wide range of settings.

Waiting calls from the front-office queue flow over to the back office if a waiting-time limit is reached and at least one back-office agent is available. The analysis of such a system with time-dependent overflow is reduced to the analysis of a continuous-time Markov chain with state-dependent overflow probabilities. To approximate the system with time-dependent overflow, some waiting-based performance measures are modified. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of this Markovian performance approximation for different parameter settings. A sensitivity analysis shows the impact of the waiting-time limit and the dependence of the performance measures on the arrival rate.

These firms have collection centers across the country to collect outstanding balances from delinquent accounts. Their main strategy is to first send reminder notices and, if that does not work, to telephone delinquent customers and request payment. The latter often becomes necessary, resulting in high costs of collection. Automated dialers are used to make the calls, and when the call goes through, it is directed to one of several hundred associates manning computer workstations. In this operation, it is important to contact the account holder in order to discuss payment options. Simply getting someone on the line is not sufficient, because such calls would require follow-up calls. The objective of efficient collections is to maximize dollars collected while minimizing costs, which generally translates to making a "right party contact (RPC)" in the minimum number of attempts. We developed and tested an algorithm that increased the RPC rates by over 10%. This increase translates to annual savings of several million dollars for an average credit card company. Although the focus of our paper is collections, the methodology developed is equally applicable for improving telemarketing efficiency.

The Fed believes that DIs should play a more active role in recirculating fit (i.e., usable) currency so that the societal cost of providing currency to the public is minimized. The Fed characterizes the overuse by the extent of cross shipping, a practice in which the same DI deposits and withdraws currency of the same denomination within five business days in the same geographic region. The Fed's proposal encourages DIs to fit sort and reuse deposited currency through two components: a custodial inventory program and a recirculation fee that would be charged on withdrawals of cross-shipped currency. Given the geographical network of the various branches of a DI, the extent of its participation in the proposed programs depends on a variety of factors: the nature of demand and supply of currency, number and locations of the processing centers, and the resulting fit-sorting, holding, and transportation costs. The interrelated nature of these decisions motivates the need for an integrated model that captures the flow of currency in the entire network of the DI. Based on our work with Brink's Inc., a leading secure-logistics provider, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to provide managers of DIs with a decision-making tool under the Fed's new guidelines. Broadly, we analyze the following questions: (i) Over all typical practical realizations of the demand for currency that a DI may face, and over all reasonable cost implications, is there a menu of "good" operating policies? (ii) What is the monetary impact of fit-sorting and custodial inventories on a DI? and (iii) To what extent will the Fed's new guidelines address its main goal, namely, a reduction in the practice of cross shipping by encouraging DIs to recirculate currency?.

Here we consider flexibility in automotive order fulfillment systems to enhance the ability to satisfy customers with their desired vehicle variants within acceptable delivery lead times. Two types of flexibility are compared in a Virtual-Build-to-Order system-reconfiguration in the planning pipeline and interdealer trading. A representative simulation model is used to investigate the impact of the two types of flexibility across a wide spectrum of product variety levels. The impacts on major stakeholders in the system-the producer, dealers, and customers-are considered. The study shows that both types of flexibilities can bring significant benefits in terms of reductions in lead time and inventory holding. The level of product variety strongly influences the observed effects-an important finding in the mass customization context. Upstream reconfiguration flexibility brings greater benefits than downstream trading flexibility. Reconfiguration tends to dominate trading as a fulfillment mechanism when both are in operation. The findings have implications for the design and management of automotive order fulfillment systems in improving their ability to offer mass customization. The study has relevance for companies in other sectors with high levels of variety that seek to combine efficiency, speed, and flexibility in order fulfillment.

Researchers have analyzed the trade-offs between customization and dimensions of operational performance such as delivery times, quality, and costs. However, we argue that providing efficient customization is not sufficient per se to assess the value of mass customization. From this perspective, this paper focuses on complementary mechanisms for creating value: the benefits perceived by individual consumers. Two global components of perceived value within the context of mass customization are identified: mass-customized product, with three dimensions, and mass customization experience, with two dimensions. The Consumer-Perceived Value Tool (CPVT) is proposed to empirically measure the five perceived benefits related to the mass-customized product and to the codesign process from the consumer viewpoint. The psychometric properties of the CPVT are assessed using three samples. The implications of this approach are discussed, along with directions for further research.

Specifically, three dimensions of organizational structure are considered-flatness, centralization, and employee multifunctionality. We model organizational structure as a second-order factor whose value is captured on a mechanistic-organic continuum, where the organic form is characterized by a flat, decentralized structure with a wide use of multifunctional employees. We propose that a positive relationship exists between the organic organizational structure and MC capability. Additionally, building upon contingency theory, we argue that this positive relationship is moderated by mass customizer type-full mass customizers, which customize products at the design or fabrication stage of the production cycle, versus partial customizers, which customize products only at the assembly or delivery stages. Based on a study of 167 manufacturing plants from three industries and eight countries, we find that, for the overall sample, organic structure plays a significant role in enabling firms to pursue MC capability. However, an analysis of full versus partial mass customizers shows that the positive impact of organic structure on MC capability is statistically significant only for full mass customizers, not for partial mass customizers.

A traditional manufacturing strategy would be to employ two separate manufacturing facilities: a flexible plant for mass-customized items and an efficient plant for standard items. We contrast this traditional focus strategy with an alternative that better utilizes capacity by combining production of mass-customized and standard items in one of two alternate spackling strategies: (1) a pure-spackling strategy, where the manufacturer produces everything in a (single) flexible plant, first manufacturing custom products as demanded each period, and then filling in the production schedule with make-to-stock output of standard products; or (2) a layered-spackling strategy, which uses an efficient plant to make a portion of its standard items and a separate flexible plant where it spackles. We identify the optimal production strategy considering the tradeoff between the cost premium for flexible (versus efficient) production capacity and the opportunity costs of idle capacity. Spackling amortizes fixed costs of capacity more effectively and thus can increase profits from mass customization vis-a-vis a focus strategy, even with higher cost production for the standard goods. We illustrate our framework with data from a messenger bag manufacturer.

Using 4 years of data from stores of a large retailer, we show that increases in product variety and inventory levels are both associated with higher sales. We also show that increasing product variety and inventory levels has an indirect negative effect on store sales through their impact on phantom products-products that are physically present at the store, but only in storage areas where customers cannot find or purchase them. Our study highlights a consequence of increased product variety and inventory levels that has previously been overlooked in studies of retail product variety and inventory management. It also quantifies the impact of phantom products on store sales. In addition, our study provides empirical evidence to support earlier claims that higher product variety and inventory levels lead to an increase in defect rate. We discuss the implications of our findings for retail inventory and assortment planning and for the design of retail stores.

This paper develops a two-stage stochastic optimization model to guide the allocation of budget to acquire and position relief assets, decisions that typically need to be made well in advance before a disaster strikes. The optimization focuses on minimizing the expected number of casualties, so our model includes first-stage decisions to represent the expansion of resources such as warehouses, medical facilities with personnel, ramp spaces, and shelters. Second-stage decisions concern the logistics of the problem, where allocated resources and contracted transportation assets are deployed to rescue critical population (in need of emergency evacuation), deliver required commodities to stay-back population, and transport the transfer population displaced by the disaster. Because of the uncertainty of the event's location and severity, these and other parameters are represented as scenarios. Computational results on notional test cases provide guidance on budget allocation and prove the potential benefit of using stochastic optimization.

The fundamental idea behind our dynamic programming decomposition method is to allocate the revenue associated with an itinerary among the different flight legs and to solve a single-leg revenue management problem for each flight leg in the airline network. The novel aspect of our approach is that it chooses the revenue allocations by solving an auxiliary optimization problem that takes the probabilistic nature of the customer choices into consideration. We compare our approach with two standard benchmark methods. The first benchmark method uses a deterministic linear programming formulation. The second benchmark method is a dynamic programming decomposition idea that is similar to our approach, but it chooses the revenue allocations in an ad hoc manner. We establish that our approach provides an upper bound on the optimal total expected revenue, and this upper bound is tighter than the ones obtained by the two benchmark methods. Computational experiments indicate that our approach provides significant improvements over the performances of the benchmark methods.

The service sector, like the manufacturing industry, in India is booming. Following the trend of their western counterparts, service organizations in India are implementing enterprise-level information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support service processes. In this paper, we used socio-technical systems theory to develop hypotheses about the effects of ICTs on the five job characteristics, i.e., skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback, in the job characteristics model (JCM) in a service organization (a bank) in India. We also tested the entire JCM that relates job characteristics to job satisfaction and job performance via various mediators and moderators. In a 32-month longitudinal field study of 1743 employees, we gathered one wave of data before an ICT implementation and two waves after the implementation. We found that, although the ICT enriched employees' job characteristics, employees reported significantly lower job satisfaction and job performance. To understand this puzzling finding, we conducted a qualitative study and identified four contextual forces that contribute to these results and hinder successful implementation of ICTs in the service sector in India and, possibly, other developing countries: environmental barriers, learning difficulty, culture shock, and employee valuation.

The planning issues are whether and when to make this switch from the "single-status" Rx drug phase to the "dual-status" Rx+OTC phase with or without the grant of a 3-year market exclusivity period for the OTC drug by the US Food and Drug Administration. We formulate an optimal control problem that leads to a two-phase optimization problem with finite-time horizon involving switching time-dependent switching cost and terminal value. Applying a variational approach, we establish the conditions under which it can be optimal to make the partial switch. Counter to conventional thinking, the grant of market exclusivity is neither necessary nor sufficient for a partial switch before the Rx drug's patent expiry. Further, we show in a functionally specified model-based illustration, involving varying combinations of plausible ratios of OTC and Rx version margins and potential market sizes, that denial of OTC market exclusivity can imply that the firm should advance rather than delay the partial switch, and yield greater savings for Rx drug consumers. Implications for pharmaceutical Rx-OTC switch planners and policymakers are discussed.

The PCM, who is the sole supply source of a critical component used to assemble an end product, can either provide its component to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in the end-product market (component supplier structure), develop the end product exclusively under its own brand (monopoly structure), or provide the component to the OEM as well as develop the end product under its own brand (dual distributor structure). Typically, the end products of the PCM and the OEM will be differentiated, and the OEM tends to have a capability advantage (compared with the PCM) in producing the end product. Our paper studies the impact of this degree of differentiation and capability advantage on the optimal choice of distribution structure. We then investigate how investing in component branding, enhancing the value of the end product, using alternative supply contracts, and product valuation uncertainty influence the PCM's optimal choice of distribution structure.

We begin by investigating the impacts of a retailer's decisions on consumers' purchase behaviors, and show that the CFS strategy is useful to acquire the consumers with large order sizes. Then, we compute the probability of repeated purchases, and construct an expected profit function for an online retailer in the monopolistic setting. We find that the fixed shipping fees may have the largest impact on the retailer's profit among all shipping-related parameters, and the retailer can benefit more from homogeneous markets than from heterogeneous ones. Next, we consider the competition between two retailers in the duopoly structure, and analytically show that, if two retailers have identical fixed and variable shipping fees, then their equilibrium decisions are equal. In order to numerically find a Nash equilibrium for two retailers, we develop a simulation approach using Arena and OptQuest. Our simulation-based examples suggest that, as a result of the competition, the two retailers should decrease their profit margins but increase their CFS cutoff levels if they have the same fixed and also the same variable shipping fees.

A key concern is that earnings misrepresent changes in value in that cash outlays occur upfront but expenses are recognized only over time. While recognized expenses indeed add up to the initial cash outflow, the equality holds only in undiscounted (nominal), not discounted (real), terms. Accordingly, corporate earnings figures suffer from a form of money illusion. In this paper, we demonstrate that such money illusion can have an upside when it is present in vertical relationships subject to self-interest. In particular, a buyer who focuses on earnings has incentives to increase purchases since it does not immediately encounter the full cost of cash outflows. These added incentives can promote more efficient trade. We also show that the increased incentives to buy can also lead to Pareto improvements by spurring the supplier to invest more in developing technology. Finally, we demonstrate that judiciously chosen inventory valuation rules can lead to efficient supply chain outcomes. Thus, efficiency can be achieved when supply chain parties freely trade and regulators specify only the accounting rules under which they operate.

We show that operations management decisions and financial hedging are intertwined, and we advance a framework that can identify their combined effects on investors' wealth. We show that: (a) firms (publicly traded corporations) will optimally hold adequate riskless working capital (e.g., cash) to minimize the cost of obtaining non-financial inputs, and the magnitude of this cash holding depends on operating details, and (b) operations management and financial hedging can lower firms' cash requirements, and boost productivity, defined as the wealth created in the firm per dollar of invested capital. Productivity-enhancing practices-by "freeing up" some of the firm's cash-can maximize the investors' wealth. We show that these results obtain because firms' contracts with many of the providers of non-financial inputs are not traded, and because investors can invest not just in public corporations but also in businesses "outside the markets" (e.g., proprietorships, partnerships, and private equity).

In a think-aloud experiment, subjects verbalize their cognitions while performing a task; responses are then recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. A majority of the subjects struggled with the abstractness of the business setting and were keen to know information on the product type, industry setting, decisions taken in the past, competitor's situation, etc. A large portion of the participants correctly identified the overage and underage costs, but failed to convert that information into the optimal order quantity. Finally, the bias in the order quantity was significantly influenced by the specific type of risk (overage or underage) that was identified closer to the decision, alluding to the presence of a recency effect. As a first application of verbal protocol analysis to inventory decision making, this study gives us an opportunity to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this research methodology.

Each supply chain consists of one supplier and one retailer. The two demand streams are jointly described with a vector autoregressive time-series process in which they interact and their respective innovation errors correlate contemporaneously. For each supply chain, we develop insights into when and how much the supplier and the retailer can improve on their forecasting accuracy if the external demand history of the other supply chain is utilized. When this external demand history is not available or made available after a time lag, we develop a partial process and a delayed process to characterize the demand structure that the retailer can recover from the available demand histories. Our results show that the external demand history of the other supply chain always helps the retailer make better forecasts when demand streams interact; however, the enhanced information alters the retailer's order process, which may produce larger forecasting errors for the supplier. Conditions are established for the supplier to benefit from the external demand history of the other supply chain.

Standard practice is to treat lead time demand as a random sum of random numbers and rely on established probability theory to calculate both reorder point and safety stock levels. A key assumption in these calculations, however, is that lead time and demand are not correlated. In this paper, we first explore situations where this assumption is untrue and then develop equations to determine the reorder point and the safety stock when lead time and demand are correlated. More specifically, we (1) derive formulas for the average and variance of the demand in a lead time, which can then be used to calculate the reorder point and the safety stock, (2) apply these formulas to two distributions for which there is a closed-form solution: normal and Poisson, and (3) examine the effect of correlation on safety stock requirements under the normal distribution.

We find that demand variability impacts the benefit of dynamic pricing not only through the magnitude of the variability but also through its functional form (e.g., whether it is additive, multiplicative, or others). We provide an approach to quantify the profit improvement of dynamic pricing over static pricing without having to solve the dynamic pricing problem. We also demonstrate that dynamic pricing is most effective when it is jointly optimized with inventory replenishment decisions, and that its advantage can be mostly realized by using one or two price changes over a replenishment cycle.

During the transportation process, the distributor has to make an appropriate effort to preserve the freshness of the product, and his success in this respect impacts on both the quality and quantity of the product delivered to the market. The distributor has to determine his order quantity, level of freshness-keeping effort, and selling price, by taking into account the wholesale price of the producer, the cost of the freshness-keeping effort, the likely spoilage of the product during transportation, and the possible demand for the product in the market. The producer, on the other hand, has to determine the wholesale price based on its effect on the order quantity of the distributor. We develop a model to study this problem, and characterize each party's optimal decisions in both decentralized and centralized systems. We further develop an incentive scheme to facilitate coordination between the two parties. Computational results are reported to show the effects of freshness-keeping efforts.

However, in service contexts that require dynamically deciding whether to accept incoming jobs and what resource to assign to each accepted job, harnessing the benefits of flexibility requires using effective methods for making these operational decisions. Motivated by the resource deployment decisions facing a professional service firm in the workplace training industry, we address the dynamic job acceptance and resource assignment problem for systems with general resource flexibility structure, i.e., with multiple resource types that can each perform different overlapping subsets of job types. We first show that, for systems containing specialized resources for individual job types and a versatile resource type that can perform all job types, the exact policy uses a threshold rule. With more general flexibility structures, since the associated stochastic dynamic program is intractable, we develop and test three optimization-based approximate policies. Our extensive computational tests show that one of the methods, which we call the Bottleneck Capacity Reservation policy, is remarkably effective in generating near-optimal solutions over a wide range of problem scenarios. We also consider a model variant that requires dynamic job acceptance decisions but permits deferring resource assignment decisions until the end of the horizon. For this model, we discuss an adaptation of our approximate policy, establish the effectiveness of this policy, and assess the value of postponing assignment decisions.

The previous literature on unit-price contract auctions usually considers a static case where bidders' performance levels are fixed. This paper studies a dynamic setting in which bidders with a low performance level can improve their performance at a certain cost. We examine the effect of the performance-based allocation on overall bidder performance, auction efficiency, and the auctioneer's revenue, and derive the revenue-maximizing and efficient policies accordingly. Moreover, the possible upgrade in bidders' performance level gives the auctioneer an incentive to modify the auction rules over time, as is confirmed by the practice of Yahoo! and Google. We thus compare the auctioneer's revenue-maximizing policies when she is fully committed to the auction rule and when she is not, and show that the auctioneer should give less preferential treatment to low-performance bidders when she is fully committed.

These products are partially complementary in the sense that there is a common demand stream that requests all these products as complementary sets and there are streams of individual demands each requesting only one of the products. All demands are uncertain and may follow any general, joint distributions. Facing demand uncertainties, the manufacturers each choose a production quantity for its product with an objective to maximize its own expected profit. We formulate the problem as a non-cooperative game to study the strategic interactions of such firms and their implications to supply chain performance. We show that such a game may have numerous equilibria. Among all the possible equilibria, however, we prove that there always exists a unique one that maximizes each and every manufacturer's profit, and we derive an explicit solution for this Pareto-optimal equilibrium point. We further study the optimal solution for a centralized system and compare it with the decentralized solution. Managerial insights are drawn as to how system parameters and control mechanisms affect firms' decisions and performance.

The standard approach in ABC applications is to set the same service level for all stock keeping units (SKUs) in a class. In this paper, we show (for three large real life datasets) that the application of both demand value and demand volume as ABC ranking criteria, with fixed service levels per class, leads to solutions that are far from cost optimal. An alternative criterion proposed by Zhang et al. performs much better, but is still considerably outperformed by a new criterion proposed in this paper. The new criterion is also more general in that it can take criticality of SKUs into account. Managerial insights are obtained into what class should have the highest/lowest service level, a topic that has been disputed in the literature.

After schedules are created, call center resource managers receive additional information that can affect forecasted workload and resource availability. In particular, there is significant evidence, both among practitioners and in the research literature, suggesting that actual call arrival volumes early in a scheduling period (typically an individual day or week) can provide valuable information about the call arrival pattern later in the same scheduling period. In this paper, we develop a flexible and powerful heuristic framework for managers to make intra-day resource adjustment decisions that take into account updated call forecasts, updated agent requirements, existing agent schedules, agents' schedule flexibility, and associated incremental labor costs. We demonstrate the value of this methodology in managing the trade-off between labor costs and service levels to best meet variable rates of demand for service, using data from an actual call center.

In this paper, we accumulate, integrate, and examine the wide spectrum of conclusions reached in the literature concerning tradeoffs using modified meta-analysis methods. Based on two decades of empirical research in operations strategy, we find that the evidence in the literature indicates manufacturers, on average, do not report experiencing tradeoffs among the competitive dimensions of quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost as suggested by the classical tradeoffs model. Our meta-analysis also reveals that the way variables are operationalized, whether initiatives are implemented, and the unit of analysis are all related to the degree and nature of the evidence a paper contains with respect to the tradeoffs issue. We interpret our meta-analysis results in the context of the prevailing model of manufacturing strategy and the theory of performance frontiers. We also discuss how the research designs used in this literature, which are predominantly cross-sectional, affect the nature of the evidence generated and the conclusions that can be drawn. We go on to suggest research designs that more directly assess the tradeoffs issue.

In particular, uncertainties in a new product introduction often lead to extreme cases of demand and supply mismatches. This paper addresses inventory planning decisions for product upgrades when there is no replenishment opportunity during the transition period. We allow product substitution: when a company runs out of the old product, a customer may be offered the new product as a substitute. We show that the optimal substitution decision is a time-varying threshold policy and establish the optimal planning policy. Further, we determine the optimal delay in a new product introduction, given the initial inventory of the old product.

The context is very general: a production process that is characterized by multiple distinct operational states and a failure state. The operational states differ in terms of operational/quality costs and/or the proneness to complete failure. The times of shift from the normal operational state to an inferior one and the times to failure are random variables, not necessarily exponentially distributed. The process is monitored with a control chart with the purpose of quickly detecting shifts to an inferior operational state due to the occurrence of some unobservable assignable cause. At the same time, the information collected from the process may be used to re-schedule the planned PM, if there is evidence that a failure is imminent. The two mechanisms are obviously related, especially if they are based on measurements of the same critical process characteristic. Yet, they are typically treated independently. We develop a fairly general mathematical model for the joint optimization of the control chart parameters and the maintenance times. Numerical investigation using this model shows that ignoring the close relationship between process control and maintenance results in inefficiencies that may be substantial. It also provides practical insights about the effects of some key problem characteristics on the optimal joint design of process control and maintenance.

Our analysis indicates that rebates are profitable for manufacturers if consumers are inconsistent in the sense that their rebate valuation when they make purchase decisions is independent of their redemption probabilities when they make redemption decisions. If the manufacturer keeps the wholesale price unchanged, then the rebate increases the retailer's profit by a larger amount than the increase in the manufacturer's profit. If the manufacturer jointly optimizes the wholesale price and rebate, then the increase in the manufacturer's profit is twice the increase in the retailer's profit. The retailer responds to rebates by increasing the retail price, which increases the margin paid by consumers who do not redeem the rebate. On average, consumer surplus decreases when it is optimal for manufacturers to offer rebates. We suggest incentive schemes that make it worthwhile for retailers to limit the price increase. In these incentive schemes, the manufacturer imposes a negative relationship between the rebate value and the retail price. We show that such incentives increase supply chain profits.

A newsvendor retailer can have three strategies to choose from: no advance selling allowed (NAS), moderate advance selling with a moderate discount for pre-orders (MAS), and deep advance selling with a deep discount for pre-orders (DAS). This research studies how a retailer could design an advance selling strategy to maximize her own profits. We find some interesting results. For example, there exist two thresholds for the selling season profit margin and two thresholds for consumer's expected valuation. For products with higher profit margin than the high threshold on profit margin, a retailer should always use DAS. For products with medium profit margin within the two thresholds, a retailer should adopt MAS if consumer's expected valuation is lower than the high threshold and use DAS otherwise. For products with lower profit margin than the low threshold, a retailer should use NAS, DAS, or MAS, respectively, if consumer's expected valuation is lower than the low threshold, higher than the high threshold, or between the two thresholds, respectively. Through sensitivity analyses, we also show the effects of multiple consumer characteristics on a retailer's optimal advance selling strategy.

We propose a model for optimizing the inventory and production decisions under the above ATO environment. We also extend our model to the situation where the manufacturer can fulfill the unsatisfied low-priority demand using the left-over inventories after fulfilling the high-priority demand, in case the low-priority customer arrives first. Numerical experiments are conducted, which provide some interesting insights on the impact of uncertain demand pattern.

However, the conventional JIT system is designed for mass production with a stable master production schedule. This paper suggests supplementing the information provided by production kanbans with information about customer waiting lines to be used by operators to schedule production in each work-station of intermittent and small batch production systems. This paper uses simulation to analyze the effect of four scheduling policy variables-number of kanbans, length of the withdrawal cycle, information about customer waiting lines, and priority rules on two performance measures-customer wait-time and inventory. The results show that using information about customer waiting lines reduces customer wait-time by about 30% while also reducing inventory by about 2%. In addition, the effect of information about customer waiting lines overshadows the effect of priority rules on customer wait-time and inventory.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been publicized as a promising solution for the misplaced inventory. Adoption of this technology has a fixed cost and variable cost of implementation, which can cause incentive issues in the supply chain. In this paper, we consider a supply chain under misplacement of inventory subject to uncertain demand. We study both centralized and decentralized cases and identify the conditions to coordinate the supply chain under implementation of RFID. We show that the incentives of the parties for investing in the technology are not perfectly aligned in the existence of the fixed cost of investment. Based on the relative payments of the parties for the fixed cost of investment, the incentives to adopt RFID can be characterized into regions, where we observe only one party or two parties benefiting from the technology when the tag price falls in a region specified in the paper. We further establish the effects of changes in mean and variance of a uniform demand on the incentives for investing in RFID and find that the incentives of the firms may indeed decrease as demand becomes more variable.

For both the finite and infinite horizon cases, we characterize the optimal policy of the firm where the decision variables are one, two, or all three of the aforementioned variables. Next, we consider the duopolistic setting, where firms benefit from the overflow of the competitor's unmet demand, and we provide analytic solutions in the case of uniform demand distributions. Finally, we report on computational experiments in both monopolistic and duopolistic settings and provide managerial insights.

This problem is modeled as a stochastic dynamic game in which the company's objective is to maximize total expected revenues, and each customer maximizes the expected present value of utility. We prove the existence of a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium pricing policy, provide equilibrium optimality conditions for both customer and seller, and prove monotonicity results for special cases. We demonstrate through numerical examples that a company that ignores strategic consumer behavior may receive much lower total revenues than one that uses the strategic equilibrium pricing policy. We also show that, when the initial capacity is a decision variable, it can be used together with the appropriate pricing policy to effectively reduce the impact of strategic consumer behavior. The proposed model is computationally tractable for problems of realistic size.

A firm can manage this variation by acquiring a quantity of used items that exceeds demand, enabling it to remanufacture a subset of the acquired items in the best condition. As more excess items are acquired, the firm can increase its selectivity and lower its remanufacturing costs. In this paper, we examine the tradeoff of acquisition and scrapping costs vs. remanufacturing costs when used product condition is widely varying and uncertain. We derive acquisition quantities that minimize total expected costs for several representations of condition variability and remanufacturing cost structures. We find that, when costs are linear, the optimal acquisition quantity has a closed form and increases with the square root of the degree of condition variability. Our models are based on experience with remanufacturers of cell phones and imaging supplies, and application of our results is illustrated using example data from industry.

The warehousing literature on order picking mostly considers minimizing either elapsed time or distance as the sole objective, whereas warehouse managers in a supply chain have to look beyond single-dimensional performance and consider trade-offs among different criteria. Thus managers still need a unified and efficient framework to select a portfolio of appropriate order picking policies from a multi-criteria and contextual perspective. Our framework-combining data envelopment analysis, ranking and selection, and multiple comparisons-provides an efficient methodology to simultaneously analyze several interrelated problems in order picking systems with multiple performance attributes, such as service levels and operational costs. We demonstrate our approach through comprehensive evaluations of order picking policies in three low-level, picker-to-parts rectangular warehouses facing demand variations.

By coordinating arrivals of cargo delivery trucks with outbound flight departure schedules, some of the shipments can be transferred directly to the departing flights, while others will be stored at the terminal's storage facility and incur extra handling and storage costs. The objective is to obtain a feasible schedule so as to minimize the total cost of operations. We formulate the problem as a time-indexed integer program and show that, even with limited number of unloading docks at the terminal, the problem is non-trivial (NP-hard in the strong sense). Our solution method includes an exact solution procedure to determine an optimal unloading sequence for the shipments carried by each truck, together with a Lagrangian relaxation-based heuristic for assigning trucks to truck docks and determining truck arrival times. We conducted computational experiments to test the performance of our solution method. Computational results show that our method can generate near-optimal solutions efficiently. Our simulation results indicate that the scheduling approach proposed in this paper has the potential to generate significant cost savings over a first-come, first-served approach currently used at the air cargo terminal that we observed.

The airlines choose their network structures and construct capacities while demands are unknown. After uncertainty is resolved, they determine the total number of seats to offer in each leg constrained by their capacities built earlier. We conclude that market uncertainty is the driving force of hub-and-spoke networks, whereas the market mean is the driving force of point-to-point networks. Which of the two countervailing forces dominates determines the equilibrium network structures. Moreover, we find that the airlines' total expected profits in the mixed equilibrium in which the airlines employ different networks are larger than in the pure hub-and-spoke network equilibrium in which each airline employs the hub-and-spoke network. However, the mixed equilibrium does not necessarily yield larger profits than the pure point-to-point equilibrium in which each airline employs the point-to-point network.

Since the number of such solicitations far exceeds the number of movies that can be feasibly screened at a multiplex (i.e., a theater with multiple screens), the problem of interest for an exhibitor is that of choosing a subset of movies for which to submit bids to the distributors. We consider the problem of the selection and screening of movies for a multiplex to maximize the exhibitor's cumulative revenue over a fixed planning horizon. The release times of the movies that can potentially be selected during the planning horizon are known a priori. If selected for screening, a movie must be scheduled through its obligatory period, after which its run may or may not be extended. The problem involves two primary decisions: (i) the selection of a subset of movies for screening from those that can potentially be screened during the planning horizon and (ii) the determination of the duration of screening for the selected movies. We investigate two basic and popular screening policies: preempt-resume and non-preempt. In the preempt-resume policy, the screening of a movie can be preempted and resumed in its post-obligatory period. In the non-preempt policy, a movie is screened continuously from its release time until the time it is permanently withdrawn from the multiplex. We show that optimizing under the preempt-resume policy is strongly NP-hard while the problem under the non-preempt policy is polynomially solvable. We develop efficient algorithms for the problem under both screening policies and show that the revenue obtained from the preempt-resume policy can be significantly higher as compared with that from the non-preempt policy. Our work provides managers of multiplexes with valuable insights into the selection and screening of movies and offers an easy-to-use computational tool to compare the revenues obtainable from adopting these popular policies.

We address key market and operating factors that make one scheme preferable to the other from the viewpoints of recyclers, manufacturers, and consumers. To this end, we model competitive decision making in both take-back schemes as two-stage sequential games between competing manufacturers and recyclers. Deriving and computing equilibria, we find that the competitive take-back scheme often accomplishes a win-win situation, that is, lower product prices, and higher recycler and manufacturer profits. Exceptionally, recyclers prefer the monopolistic scheme when the substitutability level between the manufacturers' original products is high or economies of scale in recycling are very strong. We show that consolidation of the recycling industry could benefit all stakeholders when the economies of scale in recycling are strong, provided that manufacturer's products are not highly substitutable. Higher collection rates also render recycler consolidation desirable for all stakeholders. We also identify a potential free rider problem in the monopolistic scheme when recyclers differ in operational efficiency, and propose mechanisms to eliminate the discrepancy. We show that our results and insights are robust to the degree of competition within the recycling industry.

We present a model of demand cannibalization and a behavioral study that estimates a key modeling parameter: a fraction of consumers who switch from new to remanufactured product. As we show, this fraction has an inverted-U shape, and, thus, the underlying consumer behavior cannot be modeled using the standard methodologies that rely on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). We find that by incorporating the inverted-U-shaped consumer behavior, the firm remanufactures under broader conditions, charges a much lower price, and typically remanufactures more units-leading to an increase of profits from remanufacturing by up to a factor of two as compared with making decisions based on the WTP only. Lastly, we find that the behavior of the low-price market segment plays an important role because the firm reacts to it differently than the WTP-based logic would suggest.

In many firms, manufacturing/sales and remanufacturing/remarketing operations are carried out in different divisions. Each division is responsible for only part of the product's life cycle. Practices regarding transfer pricing across divisions vary significantly among companies, affecting the life-cycle profit performance of the product. In this research, we identify characteristics of transfer prices that achieve the firm-wide optimal solution. To this end, we consider a manufacturer who also undertakes remanufacturing operations and we focus on price (quantity) decisions. We determine that a cost allocation mechanism that allocates a portion of the initial production cost to each of the two stages of the product life cycle should be used. We also conclude that cost allocation should be implemented as a fixed cost allocation, where charges to the remanufacturing division should be determined independently of the actual quantity of units remanufactured.

Based on data collected at a large primary care facility, this paper investigates how several sources of variability affect facility performance. These sources include ancillary tasks performed by the physician, patient punctuality, unscheduled visits to the facility's laboratory or X-ray services, momentary interruptions of a patient's examination, and examination time variation by patient class. Our results indicate that unscheduled visits to the facility's laboratory or X-ray services have the largest impact on a physician's idle time. The average patient wait is most affected by how the physician prioritizes completing ancillary tasks, such as telephone calls, relative to examining patients. We also investigate the improvement in system performance offered by using increasing levels of patient information when creating the appointment schedule. We find that the use of policies that sequence patients based on their classification improves system performance by up to 25.5%.

However, recent revenue management (RM) research has demonstrated what appear to be systematic deviations from normative models of decision making. These deviations can even be observed in relatively simple RM contexts. We suggest that technical errors in capacity allocation decisions are linked to issues such as arousal and stress associated with state conditions of RM tasks. Our study goes beyond existing findings by considering behavioral phenomena in concurrent task settings, where the decision maker is faced with managing decisions for more than one product or service. Physiological measures of eye dilation and blink rate are used as markers of arousal and stress in subjects engaged in RM tasks. Our analysis shows that physiological responses are indeed associated with both the state conditions of RM tasks and the number of capacity blocks managed concurrently by an individual. Deviations from modeled decision making appear to be significantly dependent upon these physiological responses. We conclude with a discussion of implications for further research and practice.

The disadvantage is that the firm loses the revenue from the software. The advantage is that the users' network can contribute to the quality of the software code, which increases the demand for the software and for a complementary product. Demand for the complementary product also goes up, because demand for a product increases when the price of its complement decreases, and under open source, the price of the software product drops down to zero. This paper examines the strategic interactions at work here, within a duopoly framework, and tries to determine the circumstances under which it is optimal for a firm to open its code. We find that firms open the source code when there is a competitive software-product market, a less competitive complementary-product market, and when the complementary product is of high quality. Furthermore, it is more profitable for the firm to open the source code if its competitor also does so. When this happens the incentive to open the code can even be higher than in a monopoly situation. More intense competition induces symmetric equilibria in which both firms choose the same strategy.

Suppliers may form alliances, and each alliance then sells a kit of components to the assembler and determines the price for that kit. The assembler buys the components (kits) from the alliances and sets the selling price of the product. Nagarajan and Sosic consider three modes of competition-supplier Stackelberg, vertical Nash (VN), and assembler Stackelberg models-which correspond to different power structures in the market, and study stable supplier alliances when the assembler faces linear and isoelastic demand. In this paper, we study the impact that demand uncertainty has on stability results obtained in Nagarajan and Sosic. We first analyze models in which all decisions are made before the uncertainty is resolved, and show that the alliance of all suppliers remains stable when demand is isoelastic, or under Stackelberg models when demand is linear. However, demand uncertainty may change stability results when both parties make decisions simultaneously (VN model) and demand is linear. We then extend our results by considering scenarios in which some decisions may be postponed and made after the actual demand is known. When the ordering quantity can be determined after observing the true demand, we show that stable outcomes correspond to those obtained in the deterministic case and uncertainty has no impact on coalition stability; if only the assembler's pricing decision is postponed, we need additional conditions for stability results to carry over in the additive demand model.

The retailer might need to borrow money from a bank to execute his order. The bank offers a fairly priced loan for relevant risks. Failure of loan repayment leads to a costly bankruptcy (fixed administrative costs, costs proportional to sales, and a depressed collateral value). We identify the retailer's optimal order quantity as a function of the wholesale price and his total wealth (working capital and collateral). The analysis of the supplier's optimal wholesale price problem as a Stackelberg game, with the supplier the leader and the retailer the follower, leads to unique equilibrium solutions in wholesale price and order quantity, with the equilibrium order quantity smaller than the traditional newsvendor one. Furthermore, in the presence of the retailer's bankruptcy risks, increases in the retailer's wealth lead to increased supplier's wholesale prices, but without the retailer's bankruptcy risks the supplier's wholesale prices stay the same or decrease in retailer's wealth.

We consider a setting in which the downstream party has the ability to exert a costly effort to increase demand (e.g., through sales promotions, advertising, etc.) during the selling season, and compare two situations: one where there is zero lead time (i.e., all demand can be satisfied after observing the demand realization), and one where orders need to be made before demand is realized. We identify two interacting effects that may inhibit shorter lead times. A so-called "safety stock effect" can be observed when a lower risk of stocking out under short lead times induces the downstream party to alter her order quantity. A second effect, termed as "effort effect," arises if shorter lead times impact the downstream party's optimal sales effort, and, as a consequence, lead to different order quantities. We provide a formal characterization of both effects, insight into how these effects interact, and show under which conditions the manufacturer has an incentive to offer shorter lead times.

Our main contribution here is to consider the realistic feature of time-varying arrival rates. We focus especially on delay estimators exploiting recent customer delay history. We show that time-varying arrival rates can introduce significant estimation bias in delay-history-based delay estimators when the system experiences alternating periods of overload and underload. We then introduce refined delay-history estimators that effectively cope with time-varying arrival rates together with non-exponential service-time and abandonment-time distributions, which are often observed in practice. We use computer simulation to verify that our proposed estimators outperform several natural alternatives.

The customer provides a forecast for a future order and a guarantee to purchase a portion of it. In return, the supplier commits to satisfy some or all of the forecast. The supplier pays penalties for shortfalls of the commitment quantity from the forecast, and for shortfalls of the delivered quantity from the customer's final order (not exceeding the commitment quantity). These penalties allow differential service among customers. In Durango-Cohen and Yano (2006), we analyzed the supplier's problem for a given customer forecast. In this paper, we analyze the customer's problem under symmetric information, both when the customer is honest and when he strategically orders more than his demand when doing so is advantageous. We show that the customer gains little from lying, so the supplier can use his control over the contract parameters to encourage honesty. When the customer is honest, the contract achieves (near-)coordination of the supply chain in a great majority of instances, and thus provides both excellent performance and flexibility in structuring contracts.

Under simplifying assumptions we show analytically that the chain configuration is superior to configurations suggested in the literature. In addition, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of chain configurations for more general scenarios and provide managerial insights regarding preferred configurations for different problem parameters.

As the season starts, customer orders arrive in each period, for either type of products, following a nonstationary Poisson process with random batch sizes. The substitution model we consider combines the usual supplier-driven and customer-driven schemes, in that the supplier may choose to offer substitution, at a discount price, or may choose not to; whereas the customer may or may not accept the substitution when it is offered. The supplier's decisions are the supply and substitution rules in each period throughout the season, and the replenishment quantities for both products at the beginning of the season. With a stochastic dynamic programming formulation, we first prove the concavity of the value function, which facilitates the solution to the optimal replenishment quantities. We then show that the optimal substitution follows a threshold rule, and establish the monotonicity of the thresholds over time and with respect to key cost parameters. We also propose a heuristic exhaustive policy, and illustrate its performance through numerical examples.

The zero-inventory production and distribution paradigm is supported in a variety of industries in which a product cannot be inventoried because of its short shelf life. The advantages of pool-point (or hub-and-spoke) distribution, explored extensively in the literature, include the efficient use of transportation resources and effective day-to-day management of operations. The setting of our analysis is as follows: A production facility (plant) with a finite production rate distributes its single product, which cannot be inventoried, to several pool points. Each pool point may require multiple truckloads to satisfy its customers' demand. A third-party logistics provider then transports the product to individual customers surrounding each pool point. The production rate can be increased up to a certain limit by incurring additional cost. The delivery of the product is done by identical trucks, each having limited capacity and non-negligible traveling time between the plant and the pool points. Our objective is to coordinate the production and transportation operations so that the total cost of production and distribution is minimized, while respecting the product lifetime and the delivery capacity constraints. This study attempts to develop intuition into zero-inventory production-distribution systems under pool-point delivery by considering several variants of the above setting. These include multiple trucks, a modifiable production rate, and alternative objectives. Using a combination of theoretical analysis and computational experiments, we gain insights into optimizing the total cost of a production-delivery plan by understanding the trade-off between production and transportation.

We develop a framework for incorporating real-time condition monitoring information into inventory decisions for spare parts. We consider a manufacturer who periodically replenishes inventory for a machine part that is subject to deterioration. The deterioration is captured via condition monitoring and modeled using a Wiener process. The resulting degradation model is used to derive the life distribution of a functioning part and to estimate the demand distribution for spare parts. This estimation is periodically updated, in a Bayesian manner, as additional information on part deterioration is obtained. We develop an inventory model that incorporates this updated demand distribution and demonstrate that a dynamic base-stock policy, in which the optimal base-stock level is a function of some subset of the observed condition monitoring information, is optimal. We propose a myopic critical fractile policy that captures the essence of the optimal policy, but is easier to compute. Computational experiments indicate that this heuristic performs quite well relative to the optimal policy. Adaptive inventory policies such as these can help manufacturers to increase machine availability and reduce inventory costs.

We consider a multi-period fixed-charge network location problem for which we find (1) the number of facilities, their location and capacities, (2) the production in each period, and (3) allocation of demand to facilities. Using the RO approach we formulate the problem to include alternate levels of uncertainty over the periods. We consider two models of demand uncertainty: demand within a bounded and symmetric multi-dimensional box, and demand within a multi-dimensional ellipsoid. We evaluate the potential benefits of applying the RO approach in our setting using an extensive numerical study. We show that the alternate models of uncertainty lead to very different solution network topologies, with the model with box uncertainty set opening fewer, larger facilities. Through sample path testing, we show that both the box and ellipsoidal uncertainty cases can provide small but significant improvements over the solution to the problem when demand is deterministic and set at its nominal value. For changes in several environmental parameters, we explore the effects on the solution performance.

Here we analyze the joint shelf space allocation and inventory decisions for multiple items with demand that depends on both factors. The traditional approach to solve inventory models with a state-dependent demand rate uses a time domain approach. However, this approach often does not lead to closed-form expressions for the profit rate with both dependencies. We analyze the problem in the inventory domain via level crossing theory. This approach leads to closed-form expressions for a large set of demand rate functions exhibiting both dependencies. These closed-form expressions substantially simplify the search for optimal solutions; thus we use them to solve the joint inventory control and shelf space allocation problem. We consider examples with two products to investigate the significance of capturing both demand dependencies. We show that in some settings it is important to capture both dependencies. We consider two heuristics, each one of them ignores one of the two dependencies. Using these heuristics it seems that ignoring the dependency on the shelf space might be less harmful than ignoring the dependency on the inventory level, which, based on computational results, can lead to profit losses of more than 6%. We demonstrate that retailers should use their operational control, e.g., reorder point, to promote higher demand products.

Yet, the majority of customers are still dissatisfied with the way firms resolve their complaints. Can learning to reduce service failures reduce customer dissatisfaction, and to what extent are such reductions sustainable? Previous research showed that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction (i) follow a U-shaped function of operating experience and (ii) are heterogeneous across firms. In this paper, I tease out where the U-shaped learning-curve effect and learning-curve heterogeneity originate: service failure or customers' propensity to complain with a third party given the occurrence of a service failure. Using quarterly data for nine major US airlines over 11 years, I find that the U-shaped learning-curve effect and the learning-curve heterogeneity originate in the propensity to complain. In the long term, reductions in service failure did not translate in sustainable reductions in customer dissatisfaction. Customers' propensity to complain eventually went up. Managing the propensity to complain provides more opportunity for a firm to distinguish itself from competitors.

Adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, we investigate how project planning, team stability, and communication effectiveness impact project performance and customer satisfaction. We delineate the direct and interactive influences of the antecedent variables. We also examine how these influences are moderated by two important project contexts: (a) the nature of software work (maintenance and development vs. testing projects) and (b) project maturity (new vs. mature projects). Among other results, we demonstrate that, when project planning capabilities are high, the positive impact of team stability and communication effectiveness on project performance is even higher. In addition, our results suggest that the impact of communication on project performance is muted when team stability is high. Finally, we also demonstrate that the impact of the antecedent variables on project performance varies with the nature of software work.

For example, the textile, paper, chemical, and steel industries grapple with significant levels of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) such as safeguard controls and countervailing duties. We explore three often observed supply chain strategies in industries subject to NTBs; direct procurement, split procurement, and outward processing arrangements (OPAs). We characterize the optimal procurement quantities for each of these three strategies, and examine how industry and country characteristics influence the firm's strategy preference. For example, we establish that the direct and split strategy profits increase in the NTB price variance but decrease in the mean price. These effects are sufficiently large that NTB price characteristics can dictate which supply chain strategy is preferred. Both the cost disadvantage and lead-time advantage of domestic production are also significant influencers of the preferred strategy, as is the domestic-country mandated production constraint associated with the OPA strategy.

Product managers often have to choose between introducing an incrementally better, safe new product early and a superior, yet highly risky, product later. Recommendations for managing such performance vs. time-to-market trade-offs often ignore competitive reactions to development decisions. In this paper, we study how a firm could incorporate the presence of a strategic competitor in making technology selection and investment decisions regarding new products. We consider a model in which an innovating firm and its rival can introduce a new product immediately or pursue a more advanced product for later launch. Further, the firm can reduce the uncertainty surrounding product development by dedicating more resources; the effectiveness of this investment depends on the firm's innovative capacity. Our model generates two sets of insights. First, in highly competitive industries, firms can adopt different technologies and effectively use introduction timing to mitigate the effects of price competition. More importantly, the firm could strategically invest in the advanced product to influence its rival's technology choice. We characterize equilibrium development and investment decisions of the firms, and derive innovative capacity hurdles that govern a firm's choice between the risky and safe alternatives. The effects of development flexibility-where firms might have the option to revert to the safe product if the advanced product fails-are also considered.

The first form of the incentive comprises an additional marginal payment on crossing a specified sales threshold and the second form of the incentive scheme comprises a lumpsum bonus payment on crossing the predetermined sales threshold. We model the effect of such incentives under two specific scenarios: an exclusive dealership selling a single product and a non-exclusive dealer selling two competing products. For an exclusive dealer, we show that a bonus contract not only increases the expected sales, but, more importantly, decreases the sales (order) variance. Consequently, the bonus-based scheme allows the manufacturer to regulate sales variance better. With a non-exclusive dealer, the sales variance increases substantially with an additional marginal payment contract. However, our analysis suggests that the bonus contract continues to perform better in this case, too, if the threshold level is set appropriately using the underlying demand distribution.

Either party can offer an MIR to the end consumer if it is in his best interest. The consumer demand is stochastic and depends on the product price and the amount of MIRs. When the retail price is exogenous, we show the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium under both additive and multiplicative demand functions and characterize it completely. We show that any of the following four scenarios can be the equilibrium: both parties offer MIR, only one party offers MIR, none offers MIR. When the retail price is a decision variable for the retailer and the rebate redemption rate increases with the amount of MIR, we once again prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium where both the retailer and the manufacturer offer MIRs. Using a numerical study, we show that the average post-purchase price of the product is higher not only than the perceived pre-purchase price but also than the newsvendor optimal price without an MIR. This implies that an MIR makes a product look cheaper while the consumers actually pay more on average.

As an incentive mechanism for software security quality improvement, software liability has been intensely discussed among both academics and practitioners for a long time. An alternative approach to managing software security is patch release, which has been widely adopted in practice. In this paper, we examine these two different ways of mitigating customer risk in the software market: liability and patch release. We study the impact of both mechanisms on a monopolistic software vendor's decision on security quality. We find the conditions under which each mechanism is effective in terms of improving security quality and increasing social surplus. The heterogeneous nature of loss is identified to be a key factor for the effectiveness of the liability mechanism. On the other hand, patch release can be effective and welfare-enhancing regardless of the nature of loss as long as customers incur low patching cost, and/or the vendor incurs low patch development cost. We also examine the impact of customer misperception of the outcome from vulnerable software on the effectiveness of liability.

This problem involves forecasting theater-level box office revenues for a given movie and using these forecasts to choose the best locations to screen a movie. We first develop a method that predicts theater-level box office revenues over time for a given movie as a function of movie attributes and theater characteristics. These estimates are then used by the distributor to choose where to screen the movie. The distributor's location selection problem is modeled as an integer programming-based optimization model that chooses the location of theaters in order to optimize profits. We tested our methods on realistic box office data and show that it has the potential to significantly improve the distributor's profits. We also develop some insights into why our methods outperform existing practice, which are crucial to their successful practical implementation.

To develop a model that accurately assesses the impact of patient volume and teaching status on quality, we draw on three related research streams pertaining to the volume-quality relationship, the comparative quality of care in teaching and non-teaching hospitals, and quality drivers in service institutions. We propose the impact of patient volume on process quality varies across hospitals with different teaching intensities. The test of this proposition uses a large data set that measures process quality for treatments for heart attacks and heart failures in all major US hospitals. Our results suggest that, as hospital teaching intensity increases, greater patient volume is associated with decreased process quality. Never before was such a relationship uncovered. This initial finding has important practical implications. First, the regionalization policy of hospitals should be re-evaluated in light of their teaching function. Second, the root causes for the lower quality scores of large, high resident-to-bed ratio teaching hospitals, compared with smaller versions, must be found.

Likewise, it would seem that firms could benefit by adopting and implementing technologies in some logical way so as to increase their overall performance. In this study of 555 hospitals, we investigate the order in which medical technologies are transformed into information technologies through a process of converting them from stand-alone technologies to interoperable, integrated information systems and whether certain configurations of sequences of integration yield additional value. We find that sequence does matter and that hospitals that integrated foundational technologies first-which in this case are known to be more complex-tend to perform better. Theoretical and practical implications of this finding and others are discussed.

However, ED congestion is often caused by the inability to move patients into the wards while the wards in turn are often congested primarily due to patients waiting for a bed in a long-term care (LTC) facility. The scheduling of clients to LTC is a complex problem that is compounded by the variety of LTC beds (different facilities and room accommodations), the presence of client choice and the competing demands of the hospital and community populations. We present a Markov decision process (MDP) model that determines the required access in order for the census of patients waiting for LTC in the hospitals to remain below a given threshold. We further present a simulation model that incorporates both hospital and community demand for LTC in order to predict the impact of implementing the policy derived from the MDP on the community client wait times and to aid in capacity planning for the future. We test the MDP policy vs. current practice as well as against a number of other proposed policy changes.

Controlling inpatient admissions can effectively reduce variability in hospital occupancy to mitigate these problems. Currently there are two major gateways for admission to a hospital: the ED and scheduled elective admission. Unfortunately, in highly utilized hospitals, excessive wait times make the scheduled gateway undesirable or infeasible for a subset of patients and doctors. As a result, this group often uses the ED gateway as a means to gain admission to the hospital. To better serve these patients and improve overall hospital functioning, we propose creating a third gateway: an expedited patient care queue. We first characterize an optimal admission threshold policy using controls on the scheduled and expedited gateways for a new Markov decision process model. We then present a practical policy based on insight from the analytical model that yields reduced emergency blockages, cancelations, and off-unit census via simulation based on historical hospital data.

If the second stage is full, a patient whose service at the first stage is complete is blocked and cannot leave the first stage. We develop a new heuristic for tandem systems to efficiently evaluate the effects of such blocking on system performance and we demonstrate that this heuristic performs well when compared with exact solutions and other approaches presented in the literature. In addition, we show how our tandem heuristic can be used as a building block to model more complex multi-stage hospital systems with arbitrary patient routing, and we derive insights and actionable capacity strategies for a real hospital system where such blocking occurs between units.

We compare several heuristics for scheduling an Outpatient Procedure Center. First, a discrete event simulation model is used to evaluate how 12 different sequencing and patient appointment time-setting heuristics perform with respect to the competing criteria of expected patient waiting time and expected surgical suite overtime for a single day compared with current practice. Second, a bi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine if better solutions can be obtained for this single day scheduling problem. Third, we investigate the efficacy of the bi-criteria GA when surgeries are allowed to be moved to other days. We present numerical experiments based on real data from a large health care provider. Our analysis provides insight into the best scheduling heuristics, and the trade-off between patient and health care provider-based criteria. Finally, we summarize several important managerial insights based on our findings.

This congestion is in part attributable to surgical scheduling practices, which often focus on the efficient use of operating rooms but ignore resulting downstream bed utilization. This paper describes a transparent and portable approach to improve scheduling practices, which combines a Monte Carlo simulation model and a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. For a specified surgical schedule, the simulation samples from historical case records and predicts bed requirements assuming no resource constraints. The MIP model complements the simulation model by scheduling both surgeon blocks and patient types to reduce peak bed occupancies. Scheduling guidelines were developed from the optimized schedules to provide surgical planners with a simple and implementable alternative to the MIP model. This approach has been tested and delivered to planners in a health authority in British Columbia, Canada. The models have been used to propose new surgical schedules and to evaluate the impact of proposed system changes on ward congestion.

The downstream impact on post-operative bed availability is often ignored. This can lead to the boarding of patients overnight in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) because intensive care unit beds are unavailable. In this paper, we apply integer programming and simulation to develop improved surgical scheduling assignments. We want to balance new surgeries with hospital discharges in order to reduce the variability of occupied beds from one day to the next and, as a result, to reduce boarding in the PACU.

Despite the potential importance of this issue, we find surprisingly few studies that look at how the allocation of capacity, paired with various appointment scheduling policies and different patient flow configurations, affects patient flow and clinical efficiency. In this paper, we develop an empirically based discrete-event simulation to examine the interactions between patient appointment policies and capacity allocation policies (i.e., the number of available examination rooms) and how they jointly affect various performance measures, such as resource utilization and patient waiting time. Findings suggest that scheduling lower-variance, shorter appointments earlier in the clinic (and, conversely, higher-variance, longer appointments later) results in less overall patient waiting without reducing physician utilization or increasing clinic duration. Additionally, exam rooms exhibited classic bottleneck behavior: there was no effect on physician utilization by adding exam rooms beyond a certain threshold, but too few exam rooms were devastating to clinic throughput. Some significant interactions between these variables were observed, but were not influential to the level of managerial concern. Clinicians' intuition about managing capacity in healthcare settings may differ substantially from best policies.

We formulate a stochastic model of appointment scheduling in a primary care practice. We conduct numerical experiments to optimize the performance of this system accounting for revenue and these two service quality measures as a function of the number of reserved slots for urgent patients. We compare traditional methods with the advanced-access system advocated by some physicians, in which urgent slots are not reserved, and evaluate the conditions under which alternative appointment scheduling mechanisms are optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of patient arrival dynamics to their relative performance finding that encouraging routine patients to call for same-day appointments is a key ingredient for the success of advanced-access.

We extend the analytical epidemiologic model by utilizing a patient flow approach, in order to model the multiple care-provider visit patterns of patients with a specific chronic illness. The patterns of care received by a group of patients are represented in compact form by means of a Markov model that is based on a disease-specific state space. Our framework also reflects the case-mix biases as well as the care-provider level clustering of the patients. By using this approach, we identify the patterns of care, determine the care provider and patient characteristics associated with optimal management of care, and estimate the potential influence of various interventions. The framework is applied to the data of 4000+ stroke patients discharged from the acute care hospitals of Quebec to their homes. Our findings provide a basis for designing community-based care initiatives for stroke survivors in the province.

In one form a drug manufacturer pays a rebate to the payer on a portion of sales in excess of a specified threshold. We examine the optimal design of such an agreement under complete and asymmetric information about demand. We consider two types of uncertainty: information asymmetry, defined as the payer's uncertainty about mean demand; and market uncertainty, defined as both parties' uncertainty about true demand. We investigate the optimal contract design in the presence of asymmetric information. We find that an incentive compatible contract always exists; that the optimal price is decreasing in expected market size, while the rebate may be increasing or decreasing in expected market size; that the optimal contract for a manufacturer with the highest possible demand would include no rebate; and, in a special case, if the average reservation profit is non-decreasing in expected market size, then the optimal contract includes no rebates for all manufacturers. Our analysis suggests that price-volume agreements with a rebate rate of 100% are not likely to be optimal if payers have the ability to negotiate prices as part of the agreement.

Our "secure price-masking (SPM)" technology contributes to procurement theory and practice in four significant ways: First, it preserves the privacy of every party's individual component prices. Second, SPM assures that the contract manufacturers will bid their own private purchase cost (i.e., not add a margin to their cost). Third, SPM is not invertible; i.e., none of the participants can "solve" for the private inputs of any other participant based on its own inputs and the outputs provided to it by SPM. Fourth, the posterior distribution of any other participant's private inputs is practically indistinguishable from its prior distribution. We also describe the results of a proof-of-concept implementation.

As the price decreases with the total quantity, buyers receive lower prices than they otherwise would be able to obtain individually. Previous studies on group buying focus on the benefit buyers receive in reduced acquisition costs or enhanced bargaining power. In this paper, we show that buyers can instead get hurt from such cooperation. Specifically, we consider a two-level distribution channel with a single manufacturer and two retailers who compete for end customers. We show that, under linear demand curves, group buying is always preferable for symmetric (i.e., identical) retailers. For asymmetric retailers (i.e., differing in market base and/or efficiency), group buying is beneficial to the smaller (or less efficient) player. However, it can be detrimental to the larger (or more efficient) one. Despite the lower wholesale price under group buying, the manufacturer can receive a higher revenue. Interestingly, group buying is more likely to form when retailers are competitive in different dimensions. These insights are shown to be robust under general nonlinear demand curves, except for constant elastic demand with low demand elasticity.

The suppliers have heterogeneous production costs, which are private information, and the winning supplier has to invest in production capacity before the demand uncertainty is resolved. The buyer chooses to offer a push or pull contract, for which the single price and winning supplier are determined via the auction. We show that, with a pull contract, the buyer does not necessarily benefit from a larger number of suppliers participating in the auction, due to the negative effect of supplier competition on the incentive of supplier capacity investment. We thus propose an enhanced pull mechanism that mitigates this effect with a floor price. We then analyze and compare the outcomes of auctions for push and (enhanced) pull contracts, establishing when one form is preferred over the other based on the buyer's profits. We also compare our simple, price-only push and pull contract auctions to the optimal mechanisms, benchmarking the performance of the simple mechanisms as well as establishing the relative importance of auction design and contract design in procurement auctions.

The study first establishes procurement strategies that differ based on their level of strategic emphasis, i.e., the importance that is placed on the pursuit of four strategic objectives. Underlying objectives, which are obtained via factor analysis, include the focus on price, security of supply, internal procurement efficiencies, and bundle building. Next, cluster analysis is used to derive prototypical strategic approaches. The three cluster groups that emerge possess the same relative ranking of the four objectives, but differ based on the intensity with which these objectives are pursued. The clusters are labelled as the three strategic groups of strategists, opportunists, and responders. The research then explores, using an industrial buyer behavior lens, the impact of environmental antecedents in determining a particular strategy. Environmental variables include purchase importance, market uncertainty, supply base availability, buyer bargaining power, item experience, and supply base experience. Finally, the study tests the impact of procurement strategy on the buyer's perceived performance, suggesting that strategists, placing more emphasis on the pursuit of strategic sourcing objectives, achieve better performance than opportunists and responders.

Each retailer has private information about uncertain demand. The manufacturer is the Stackelberg leader who sets the contract terms with the retailers, and benefits from retailers sharing their private information. When all retailers are given the same wholesale price, truthful information sharing is not an equilibrium outcome. We propose two variants of differential pricing mechanisms that induce truthful information sharing by all retailers. The first variant rewards a retailer for providing optimistic information and achieves truthful information sharing as a unique equilibrium. The differential pricing mechanism is optimal in the class of linear-price, incentive-compatible, direct mechanisms. The second variant, which incorporates provision for a fixed payment in addition to wholesale prices, preserves all the equilibrium properties of the first variant and additionally "nearly coordinates" the supply chain. Our analysis of differential pricing with a fixed payment provides interesting observations regarding the relationship between product substitutability, number of retailers, information precision, and market power. As products become closer substitutes and/or number of retailers increase, the manufacturer's market power increases, enabling her to extract a larger fraction of the supply chain surplus.

Each retailer is restricted to order once in every order cycle and their orders are replenished in a balanced manner within the cycle.

We find that the supplier benefits from the two mechanisms via two important factors, the information about observed end-customer demands and the decision on re-establishing the replenishment sequence. We derive the supplier's optimal sequence for stochastically comparable end-customer demands with AOI and propose a sequencing rule for the setting with information sharing. Our numerical study examines the cost impacts of two proposed mechanisms on the entire supply chain.

The underlying retail demand for the IDP is influenced by word-of-mouth from past adopters and follows a Bass-type diffusion process. The word-of-mouth influence creates a trade-off between immediate and future sales and profits, resulting in a multi-period dynamic supply chain coordination problem. Our analysis shows that while in some environments, the manufacturer is better off with a far-sighted retailer, there are also environments in which the manufacturer is better off with a myopic retailer. We characterize equilibrium dynamic pricing strategies and the resulting sales and profit trajectories. We demonstrate that revenue-sharing contracts can coordinate the IDP's supply chain with both far-sighted and myopic retailers throughout the entire planning horizon and arbitrarily allocate the channel profit.

Among the controversies, perhaps the most fundamental one is whether or not GPOs reduce purchasing costs for their members. However, the fiercest controversy is around the "contract administration fees (CAFs)" that GPOs charge to manufacturers. We examine these and other controversies using a Hotelling duopoly model. Among our conclusions: GPOs increase competition between manufacturers and lower prices for healthcare providers. However, GPOs reduce manufacturers' incentives to introduce innovations to existing products. We also demonstrate that the existence of lower off-contract prices is not, per se, evidence of anticompetitive behavior on the part of GPOs. Indeed, we demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, the presence of a GPO lowers off-contract prices. We also examine the consequences of eliminating the "safe harbor" provisions that permit healthcare GPOs to charge CAFs to manufacturers, and conclude that it would not affect any party's profits or costs.

Our model suggests that the choice of product architecture depends on firm, market, and product characteristics in addition to supply chain structure. In contrast to other studies, we find that the optimal mapping from architecture to supply chain structure is not always one-to-one. A decentralized supply chain may be associated with a more integral product when the technical collaboration penalty is not excessive and suppliers have significantly superior product development capabilities. Furthermore, in a decentralized supply chain, the nature of the relationship between the original equipment manufacturer and its supplier (adversarial or collaborative) plays a role in the choice of product architecture: modular architectures are more likely when the parties have adversarial relationships, while long-term trust-based relationships facilitate more integral product architectures.

In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of this competition in a multi-supplier retail point. Assuming that sales are shelf space dependent, we consider a retailer that optimizes its shelf space allocation among different products based on their sales level and profit margins. In this context, product manufacturers set their wholesale prices so as to obtain larger shelf space allocations but at the same time keep margins as high as possible. We analyze the equilibrium situation in the supply chain, and find that generally the retailer's and the suppliers' incentives are misaligned, resulting in suboptimal retail prices and shelf space allocations. We however find that the inefficiencies induced by suboptimal shelf space allocation decisions are small relative to those induced by suboptimal pricing decisions.

This paper analyzes its implications for category management. We consider a model where two competing manufacturers sell their differentiated products through a single retailer who determines the shelf space allocated to the category. The scope of category management is pricing. We consider two category management mechanisms: retailer category management (RCM), where the retailer determines product prices and category captainship (CC), where a manufacturer in the category determines them. Our analysis reveals that the retailer can use the form of category management and the category shelf space to control the intensity of competition between manufacturers to his benefit. We also show that the emergence of CC depends on the degree of product differentiation, the opportunity cost of shelf space, and the profit sharing arrangement in the alliance. The equilibrium category shelf space under CC may be higher than under RCM if the value to the retailer of eliminating double marginalization and putting price pressure on the non-captain manufacturer dominates the loss from sharing the profit with the category captain. CC has been criticized for disadvantaging non-captain manufacturers. While we provide some support for this claim, we also find that CC may benefit non-captain manufacturers when implemented by a powerful retailer in categories with sufficiently differentiated products, because the shelf space allocated to the category increases in this case.

However, when the underlying demand depends on the retail price, it has been known that channel coordination cannot be achieved if only one of these mechanisms is deployed. In this article, we show that a policy that combines the use of wholesale price, channel rebate, and returns can coordinate a channel with both additive and multiplicative price-dependent demands. In addition to determining the sufficient conditions for the contract parameters associated with the equilibrium policy, we show that multiple equilibrium policies for channel coordination exist. We further explore how the equilibrium policy can be adjusted to achieve Pareto improvement. Other issues such as the maximum amount of expected profit that the manufacturer can share under the coordinated channel, the structural properties of the contracts under both the additive and multiplicative price-dependent demand functions are also discussed.

One of the suppliers is a big company for whom the manufacturer's business constitutes a small part of his business. The other supplier is a small company for whom the manufacturer's business constitutes a large portion of his business. We analyze the problem from the perspective of the big supplier and address the following questions: What is the optimal contracting strategy that the big supplier should follow? How does the information about the small supplier's production cost affect the profits and contracting decision? How does the existence of the small supplier affect profits? By studying various information scenarios regarding the small supplier's and the manufacturer's production cost, we show, for example, that the big supplier benefits when the small supplier keeps its production cost private. We quantify the value of information for the big supplier and the manufacturer. We also quantify the cost (value) of the alternative-sourcing option for the big supplier (the manufacturer). We determine when an alternative-sourcing option has more impact on profits than information. We conclude with extensions and numerical examples to shed light on how system parameters affect this supply chain.

Numerous papers have appeared on this topic in the last four decades; they show that firms are better off producing in larger batches in the presence of learning and forgetting. However, these papers fail to consider one or more of realistic features of learning and forgetting; factors such as (1) the amount forgotten increases with break length between two batches and (2) the forgetting could be slow over an initial short interval followed by fast forgetting. Our paper contributes by demonstrating that a consideration of these realistic features leads to a different conclusion-firms may be better off producing in smaller batches in the presence of learning and forgetting. This is a new insight that provides one more justification for producing in small batches.

Advance selling helps retailers to reduce demand uncertainty. Consumers, however, may prefer not to purchase in advance unless given a discount because they are uncertain about their valuation for the product in advance. It is then unclear whether or when advance selling to pass some uncertainty risk to consumers is optimal for the retailer. This paper examines the advance selling price and inventory decisions in a two-period setting, where the first period is the advance selling period and the second is the selling (and consumption) period. We find that an advance selling strategy is not always optimal, but is contingent on parameters of the market (e.g., market potential and uncertainty) and the consumers (e.g., valuation, risk aversion, and heterogeneity). For example, we find that retailers should sell in advance if the consumers' expected valuation exceeds consumers' expected surplus when not buying early by a certain threshold. This threshold increases with the degree of risk aversion but decreases with stock out risk. If the degree of risk aversion varies across consumers, then a retailer should sell in advance if the probability for a consumer to spot buy is less than a critical fractile.

Carriers also sell capacity to direct-ship customers on each flight. We study capacity contracts between a carrier and a forwarder when certain parameters such as the forwarder's demand, operating cost to the carrier, margin, and reservation profit are its private information. We propose contracts in which the forwarder pays a lump sum in exchange for a guaranteed capacity allotment and receives a refund for each unit of unused capacity according to a pre-announced refund rate. We obtain an upper bound on the informational rent paid by the carrier for a menu of arbitrary allotments and identify conditions under which it can eliminate the informational rent and induce the forwarder to choose the overall optimal capacity allotment (i.e., one that maximizes the combined profits of the carrier and the forwarder).

Using a number of common demand distributions, as well as the distribution-free approximation, we compare the centralized (pooled) system with the decentralized (non-pooled) system. We investigate the sensitivity of the absolute and relative reduction in costs to the variability of demand and to the number of locations (facilities) being pooled. We show that for the distributions considered, the absolute benefit of risk pooling increases with variability, and the relative benefit stays fairly constant, as long as the coefficient of variation of demand stays in the low range. However, under high-variability conditions, both measures decrease to zero as the demand variability is increased. We show, through analytical results and computational experiments, that these effects are due to the different operating regimes exhibited by the system under different levels of variability: as the variability is increased, the system switches from the normal operation to the effective and then complete shutdown regimes; the decrease in the benefits of risk pooling is associated with the two latter stages. The centralization allows the system to remain in the normal operation regime under higher levels of variability compared to the decentralized system.

The competing viewpoints and the asymmetric nature of market returns associated with these goals in R&D projects can heighten stress levels among project team members and reduce their psychological safety. While current research calls for greater focus on task design for improving psychological safety, we know little about how team contextual factors affect this relationship. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that examines the moderating role of R&D team contextual factors, namely, relative exploration and project-organization metric alignment on the relationship between a key task design variable, namely, team autonomy, and psychological safety. Relative exploration captures the extent to which exploration goals are emphasized over exploitation goals in an R&D project, while project-organization metric alignment measures the extent to which project metrics are aligned with broader organizational metrics. Furthermore, we examine the performance consequences of psychological safety in R&D projects. The empirical analysis is conducted using primary data collected from multiple informants across 110 R&D projects in 34 high technology business units. Our results indicate that relative exploration and project-organization metric alignment have contrasting moderating effects. Furthermore, the effect of psychological safety on project performance is found to be indirect and mediated through team turnover. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

These marketplaces serve as an intermediary, matching buyers with sellers, whereas control of the good is left to the seller. In some cases, e.g., the Amazon marketplace system, the firm that owns and manages the marketplace system will also sell competing products through the marketplace system. This creates a new form of channel conflict, which is a focus of this article. We consider a setting in which a marketplace firm operates an online marketplace through which retailers can sell their products directly to consumers. We consider a single retailer, who currently sells its product only through its own website, but who may choose to contract with Amazon to sell its product through the marketplace system. Selling the product through the marketplace expands the available market for the retailer, but comes at some expense, e.g., a fixed participation fee or a revenue sharing requirement. Thus, a key question for the retailer is whether she should choose to sell through the marketplace system, and if so, at what price. We analyze the optimal decisions for both the retailer and the marketplace firm and characterize the system equilibrium.

The papers dealing with this problem are mainly focused on supperadditive games, where the cost savings associated with a coalition increase with the number of players in the coalition. The most relevant question addressed then is how to allocate the savings to the players. In this paper, we propose to go further by dealing with a non-supperadditive game, where a set of independent retailers have the common understanding to share the cost savings according to the cost-based proportional rule. In this setting, the global cost optimization is no longer a relevant approach to identify appealing coalitions for any retailer. Here, we provide an iterative procedure to form the so-called efficient coalition structure and we show that this coalition structure has the nice properties of being (i) weakly stable in the sense of the coalition structure core and (ii) strongly stable under a given assumption. An exact fractional programming based solution is also given to generate such efficient coalitions.

The firm has a preference ordering of the suppliers based on factors such as their past performance, quality, service, geographical location, and financial strength, which are commonly included in a supplier scorecard system. Thus, the firm first uses available inventory from supplier 1, if any, then supplier 2, if any, and so on. The suppliers differ in costs and prices. The buyer firm seeks to determine which suppliers to purchase from and in what quantities to maximize its total expected profit subject to the preference ordering constraint. We present the optimal solution to this problem, and show that it has a portfolio structure. It consists of a sub-set of suppliers that are ordered by their underage and overage costs. This portfolio achieves a substantial profit gain compared to sourcing from a unique supplier. We present an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal solution. Our model applies to component sourcing problems in manufacturing, merchandizing problems in retailing, and capacity reservation problems in services.

We show that IPR offers superior DfR incentives as compared to CPR, and provides a level competitive ground. CPR may distort competition and allow free-riding on DfR efforts to reduce product recovery costs. Thus, manufacturer preferences for IPR or CPR may differ because of the free-riding implications under CPR, with even high-end manufacturers having incentives to free-ride under certain competitive conditions. The policy choice between IPR and CPR is not clear cut from an economic welfare perspective. This choice involves a comparison between the effects of superior recovery cost reduction through improved DfR under IPR and the operational cost-efficiency under CPR.

Assigning and scheduling vehicles to service a pre-determined set of clients is a common distribution problem. Accounting for time-dependent travel times between customers, we present a model that considers travel time, fuel, and CO2 emissions costs. Specifically, we propose a framework for modeling CO2 emissions in a time-dependent vehicle routing context. The model is solved via a tabu search procedure. As the amount of CO2 emissions is correlated with vehicle speed, our model considers limiting vehicle speed as part of the optimization. The emissions per kilometer as a function of speed are minimized at a unique speed. However, we show that in a time-dependent environment this speed is sub-optimal in terms of total emissions. This occurs if vehicles are able to avoid running into congestion periods where they incur high emissions. Clearly, considering this trade-off in the vehicle routing problem has great practical potential. In the same line, we construct bounds on the total amount of emissions to be saved by making use of the standard VRP solutions. As fuel consumption is correlated with CO2 emissions, we show that reducing emissions leads to reducing costs. For a number of experimental settings, we show that limiting vehicle speeds is desired from a total cost perspective. This namely stems from the trade-off between fuel and travel time costs.

We show that under the optimal wholesale price contract, both the manufacturer and the reseller are always better off as the reseller's forecasting accuracy improves. Nevertheless, under the menu of two-part tariffs, the manufacturer prefers the reseller to be either uninformed or perfectly informed about the market condition. We further find that the improved forecasting accuracy is beneficial for the reseller if its current forecasting system is either very poor or very good.

We examine a channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, where the retailer is capital constrained. The retailer may fund its business by borrowing credit either from a competitive bank market or from the manufacturer, provided the latter is willing to lend. When only one credit type (either bank or trade credit) is viable, we show that trade credit financing generally charges a higher wholesale price and thus becomes less attractive than bank credit financing for the retailer. When both bank and trade credits are viable, the unique equilibrium is trade credit financing if production cost is relatively low but is bank credit financing otherwise. We also study the case where both the retailer and the manufacturer are capital constrained and demonstrate that, to improve the overall supply chain efficiency, the bank should finance the manufacturer if production cost is low but finance the retailer otherwise. Our analysis further suggests that the equilibrium region of trade credit financing shrinks as demand variability or the retailer's internal capital level increases.

In this paper we consider mechanisms by which the uncertainty surrounding inventory ordering decisions drives gray markets. We start with a minimal stochastic supply chain model composed of a producer and a retailer; then we restructure the model to add a distributor whereby the distributor and authorized retailer have the option of diverting inventory to a gray market. Our analysis sheds light on three issues: impacts of diversion on the various supply chain participants, strategies producers could use to combat or exploit gray markets, and important considerations for authorized retailers trying to set optimal order quantities in the presence of a gray market. Our analysis yields new insights into the behavior and impact of gray markets, which can inform management strategies and policies for confronting them.

In addition to random demand for the serviceable product and random returned quantities of different types of cores in each time period, the remanufacturing yield of each type of core is also uncertain. By analyzing a multi-period stochastic dynamic program, we derive several properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy. In addition to some insights, these properties can be used to reduce the search effort of the optimal policy. We also demonstrate that some existing results derived from related models no longer hold in remanufacturing systems with random yield. Recognizing the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy is highly complex, we examine three simple heuristics that can be efficiently solved and implemented in practice. Among these three heuristics, our numerical analysis suggests that the heuristic that captures most of the yield uncertainty and future system evolvement as well as some of the properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy outperforms the other two heuristics.

Although this can seemingly misalign the interests of a manager, we show that the use of such measures can help supply chain partners to overcome hold-up issues with respect to capacity and promotion investments. We develop a game theoretic model in which two supply chain partners engage in repeated interactions in which the supplier invests in capacity and the buyer invests in demand promotion. Following the realization of demand in each period, the two firms negotiate over the output quantity and wholesale price. The novelty of our model is that we allow the owners of each firm to delegate decision-making power and negotiating responsibility to a free-agent manager. We characterize the conditions under which the owners of both firms employ RF-MPMs in equilibrium and benefit from doing so. For a special case of our model, we show that for the owners of the buyer, an RF-MPM is equivalent to a price only relational contract, and that it complements a price and quantity relational contract as a mechanism for mitigating hold-up issues.

The revenue manager uses a buy-up model to select booking limits and updates estimates of the model parameters as data are accumulated. The buy-up model we consider is based upon a simple model of customer choice, wherein each low-fare customer who is not able to purchase a low-fare ticket will, with a fixed probability, buy up to the high fare, independent of everything else. We analyze the evolution of the parameter estimates (e.g., the buy-up probability) and chosen booking limits in situations where the buy-up model is misspecified, that is, in situations where there is no setting of its parameters for which its objective function gives an accurate representation of expected revenue as a function of the booking limit. The analysis is motivated by the common situation in which a revenue manager does not know precisely how customers behave but nevertheless uses a parametric model to make decisions. Under some assumptions, we prove that the booking limits and parameter estimates converge and we compare the actual expected revenue at the limiting values with that associated with the booking limits that would be chosen if the revenue manager knew the actual behavior of customers. The analysis shows that the buy-up model often works reasonably well even when it is misspecified, and also reveals the importance of understanding how parameter estimates of misspecified models vary as functions of decisions.

The model assumes that there are three sales components: the first is from consumers who have already committed to purchasing (or renting) a product (e.g., based on promotion of, or exposure to, the product prior to its launch); the second comes from consumers who are potential buyers of the product; and the third comes from either a networking effect on closely tied (as in a social group) potential buyers from previous buyers (in the case of movie rental and all retail products) or re-rents (in the case of game rental). In addition, we explicitly formulate into our model dynamic interactions between these sales components, both within and across sales periods. This important feature is motivated by realism, and it significantly contributes to the accuracy of our model. The model is thoroughly tested against sales data for rental and retail products from Blockbuster. Our empirical results show that the model offers excellent fit to actual sales activity. We also demonstrate that the model is capable of delivering reasonable sales forecasts based solely on environmental data (e.g., theatrical sales, studio, genre, MPAA ratings, etc.) and actual first-period sales. Accurate sales forecasts can lead to significant cost savings. In particular, it can improve the retail operations at Blockbuster by determining appropriate order quantities of products, which is critical in effective inventory management (i.e., it can reduce the extent of over-stocking and under-stocking). While our model is developed specifically for product sales at Blockbuster, we believe that with context-dependent modifications, our modeling approach could also provide a reasonable basis for the study of sales for other short-Life-Cycle products.

No-shows reduce revenues and provider productivity, increase costs, and limit patient access by reducing effective clinic capacity. In this article, we construct a flexible appointment scheduling model to mitigate the detrimental effects of patient no-shows, and develop a fast and effective solution procedure that constructs near-optimal overbooked appointment schedules that balance the benefits of serving additional patients with the potential costs of patient waiting and clinic overtime. Computational results demonstrate the efficacy of our model and solution procedure, and connect our work to prior research in health care appointment scheduling.

The final phase starts when the part production is terminated and continues until the last service contract or warranty period expires. Placing final orders for service parts is considered to be a popular tactic to satisfy demand during this period and to mitigate the effect of part obsolescence at the end of the service life cycle. Previous research focuses on repairing defective products by replacing the defective parts with properly functioning spare ones. However, for consumer electronic products there typically is considerable price erosion while repair costs stay steady over time. As a consequence, there might be a point in time at which the unit price of the product drops below the repair costs. If so, it is more cost effective to adopt an alternative policy to meet service demands toward the end of the final phase, such as offering customers a new product of the similar type or a discount on a next generation product. This study examines the cost trade-offs of implementing alternative policies for the repair policy and develops an exact expression for the expected total cost function. Using this expression, the optimal final order quantity and switching time from repair to an alternative policy can be determined simultaneously. Numerical analysis of a real world case sheds light on the cost benefits of these policies and also yields insights into the quantitative importance of the various cost parameters.

In addition to the OEM's product, the CM also produces for a smaller OEM. Both the larger OEM and the CM can purchase the component from the supplier, but their purchase prices may differ and remain unknown to each other. The main question we address is whether the larger OEM should retain component procurement by purchasing components from the supplier and reselling to the CM (buysell), or outsource component procurement by letting the CM purchase directly from the supplier (turnkey). We show that, under buysell, the larger OEM's optimal strategy is to resell components at the highest possible component purchase price of the CM (i.e., the street price). By comparing buysell and turnkey, we find that a CM with low component price is better off under turnkey, even though under buysell he receives more profits through the products sold to the smaller OEM. Furthermore, the larger OEM's preference between buysell and turnkey depends on her component price, the volatility of the CM's component price and substitutability between the two products.

As a result, some researchers and practitioners have been seeking to improve the performance of non-repetitive systems using JIT concepts. In this process, the JIT concepts that were originally designed for mass production have been modified to adapt JIT to non-repetitive systems. This article uses a priority rule that is based on real-time demand and production information for sequencing jobs in a kanban-controlled flowshop. The analysis of the effect of this priority rule; the number of kanbans; the length of the withdrawal cycle; First-Come, First-Served (FCFS); and Shortest Processing Time (SPT) on four performance measurescustomer wait time, total inventory, input stock-point inventory, and output stock-point inventory, shows that the use of this priority rule results in a significant reduction of customer wait time and a slight decrease in inventory.

Workload control (WLC) accomplishes this in complex make-to-order job shops by controlling lead times, capacity, and work-in-process (WIP). However, the concept has been dismissed by many authors who believe its order release mechanism reduces the effectiveness of shop floor dispatching and increases work center idleness, thereby also increasing job tardiness results. We show that these problems have been overcome. A WLC order release method known as LUMS OR (Lancaster University Management School order release) combines continuous with periodic release, allowing the release of work to be triggered between periodic releases if a work center is starving. This paper refines the method based on the literature (creating LUMS COR [Lancaster University Management School corrected order release]) before comparing its performance against the best-performing purely periodic and continuous release rules across a range of flow directions, from the pure job shop to the general flow shop. Results demonstrate that LUMS COR and the continuous WLC release methods consistently outperform purely periodic release and Constant WIP. LUMS COR is considered the best solution in practice due to its excellent performance and ease of implementation. Findings have significant implications for research and practice: throughput times and job tardiness results can be improved simultaneously and order release and dispatching rules can complement each other. Thus, WLC represents an effective means of implementing lean principles in a make-to-order context.

The need to jointly price the services assumes significance because they are partial substitutes of one another. Our study finds that the influence of the logistics network on prices is especially strong when there are non-linearities in the cost of provisioning the logistics services. Furthermore, the impact of logistics decisions on different types of pricing schemes (e.g., volume discount, bundled pricing) is different, both in its structure and extent. In present times, when the market for the fit-sorting service is relatively immature, our findings have major implications to the way an SLP's business is managed.

We explore this trade-off by examining the production quantity and cost reducing R&D investment decisions in a two period model wherein a startup firm must make a minimum level of profit at the end of the first period to survive and operate in the second period. We specify a probabilistic survival measure as a function of production and investment decisions to track and manage the risk exposure of the startup depending on three key market factors: technology, demand, and competitor's cost. We develop managerial insights by characterizing how to create operational hedges against the bankruptcy risk: if a startup makes a conservative investment decision, then it also selects an optimal quantity that is less than the monopoly level and hence sacrifices some of first period expected profits to increase its survival chances. If it decides to invest aggressively, then it produces more than the monopoly level to cover the higher bankruptcy risk. We also illustrate that debt constraint shrinks the decision space, wherein such process investments are viable.

In recent years, these efforts have been further augmented through complementary investments in information systems, which provide the technological platforms for information sharing and coordination across functional and organizational boundaries. Somewhat overlooked has been the critical mediating role of the intelligence gained through these efforts and capabilities. This study draws on the theory of complementarity to elaborate on the nature of this mediating concept. Theoretical predictions of the model are tested using instrument variable regression analysis of data collected from a sample of publicly traded US manufacturing firms. The findings suggest that the effects of both internal and external coordination on market intelligence and supply-chain intelligence are moderated by the firm's information system capability. The effect of both types of intelligence quality on new product development performance was contingent with the effects being enhanced (attenuated) when the market conditions were dynamic (stable). The results are robust to common-method bias, endogeneity concerns, and alternative estimation methods.

The first production stage (fabrication) is a push process where parts are replenished, tested, and assembled into components according to product-level build plans. The component inventory is kept in stock ready for the final assembly of the end products. The second production stage (fulfillment) is a pull-based assemble-to-order process where the final assembly process is initiated when a customer order is received and no finished goods inventory is kept for end products. One important planning issue is to find the right trade-off between capacity utilization and inventory cost reduction that strives to meet the quarter-end peak demand. We present a nonlinear optimization model to minimize the total inventory cost subject to the service level constraints and the production capacity constraints. This results in a convex program with linear constraints. An efficient algorithm using decomposition is developed for solving the nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical results are presented to show the performance improvements achieved by the optimized solutions along with managerial insights provided.

Simulation and nonlinear regression are used to derive an equation to predict the planning constant as a function of the environmental factors. We also introduce an adjustment procedure for appointment systems to explicitly minimize the disruptive effects of no-shows and walk-ins. The procedure adjusts the mean and standard deviation of service times based on the expected probabilities of no-shows and walk-ins for a given target number of patients to be served, and it is thus relevant for any appointment rule that uses the mean and standard deviation of service times to construct an appointment schedule. The results show that our Dome rule with the adjustment procedure performs better than the traditional rules in the literature, with a lower total system cost calculated as a weighted sum of patients waiting time, doctor's idle time, and doctor's overtime. An open-source decision-support tool is also provided so that healthcare managers can easily develop appointment schedules for their clinical environment.

In many industries, service level-based supply contracts are commonly used. Under such a contract, a company agrees to achieve a certain service level and to pay a financial penalty if it misses it. The service level used in our study refers to the fraction of a manufacturer's demand filled by the supplier. We analyze two types of service level-based supply contracts that are designed by a manufacturer and offered to a supplier. The first type of contract is a flat penalty contract, under which the supplier pays a fixed penalty to the manufacturer in each period in which the contract service level is not achieved. The second type of contract is a unit penalty contract, under which a penalty is due for each unit delivered fewer than specified by the parameters of the contract. We show how the supplier responds to the contracts and how the contract parameters can be chosen, such that the supply chain is coordinated. We also derive structural results about optimal values of the contract parameters, provide numerical results, and connect our service level measures to traditional service level measures. The results of our analyses can be used by decision makers to design optimal service level contracts and to provide them with a solid foundation for contract negotiations.

A class of data we call individualized trace data (ITD) identifies the real-time status of individual entities as they move through execution processes, such as an individual product passing through a supply chain or a uniquely identified mortgage application going through an approval process. We develop a mathematical framework which we call the State-Identity-Time (SIT) Framework to represent and manipulate ITD at multiple levels of aggregation for different managerial purposes. Using this framework, we design a pair of generic quality measurestimeliness and correctnessfor the progress of entities through a supply chain. The timeliness and correctness metrics provide behavioral visibility that can help managers to grasp the dynamics of supply chain behavior that is distinct from asset visibility such as inventory. We develop special quality control methods using this framework to address the issue of overreaction that is common among managers faced with a large volume of fast-changing data. The SIT structure and its associated methods inform managers on if, when, and where to react. We illustrate our approach using simulations based on real RFID data from a Walmart RFID pilot project.

The manufacturer produces a single product and sells it exclusively through the retailer. The extended warranty can be offered either by the manufacturer or by the retailer. The party offering the extended warranty decides on the terms of the policy in its best interest and incurs the repair costs of product failures. We use game theoretic models to answer the following questions. Which scenario leads to a higher supply-chain profit, the retailer offering the extended warranty or the manufacturer? How do the optimum price and extended warranty length vary under different scenarios? We find that, depending on the parameters, either party may provide better extended warranty policies and generate more system profit. We also compare these two decentralized models with a centralized system where a single party manufactures the product, sells it to the consumer, and offers the extended warranty. We also consider an extension of our basic model where either the manufacturer or the retailer resells the extended warranty policies of a third party (e.g., an independent insurance company), instead of offering its own policy.

Customers choose one queue to join upon arrival and can switch between queues in real time before entering service to maximize their spot utility, which is a function of price and queue length. We characterize the steady-state distribution for queue lengths, and then investigate a two-stage game in which the two service providers first simultaneously select service rates and then simultaneously charge prices. Our results indicate that neither service provider will have both a faster service and a lower price than its competitor. When price plays a less significant role in customers service selection relative to queue length or when the two service providers incur comparable costs for building capacities, they will not engage in price competition. When price plays a significant role and the capacity costs at the service providers sufficiently differ, they will adopt substitutable competition instruments: the lower cost service provider will build a faster service and the higher cost service provider will charge a lower price. Comparing our results to those in the existing literature, we find that the service providers invest in lower service rates, engage in less intense price competition, and earn higher profits, while customers wait in line longer when they are unable to infer service rates and are naive in service selection than when they can infer service rates to make sophisticated choices. The customers jockeying behavior further lowers the service providers capacity investment and lengthens the customers duration of stay.

Our objective is to maximize the production rate. We identify optimal server assignment policies for systems with three stations, two servers, different flexibility structures, and either deterministic service times and arbitrary buffers or exponential service times and small buffers. We use these policies to develop server assignment heuristics for Markovian systems with larger buffer sizes that appear to yield near-optimal throughput. In the deterministic setting, we prove that the best possible production rate with full server flexibility and infinite buffers can be attained with partial flexibility and zero buffers, and we identify the critical skills required to achieve this goal. We then present numerical results showing that these critical skills, employed with an effective server assignment policy, also yield near-optimal throughput in the Markovian setting, even for small buffer sizes. Thus, our results suggest that partial flexibility is sufficient for near-optimal performance, and that flexibility structures that are effective for deterministic and infinite-buffered systems are also likely to perform well for finite-buffered stochastic systems.

In such promotions, customers who buy the product in an advance preselling period are offered rebates if a pre-specified weather condition is realized during the later normal selling season. We investigate the potential benefits of these programs for retailers. We show that the weather-conditional rebate program can increase sales by price discriminating among a customer's post-purchase states. Taking advantage of the early sales, it can also reduce the inventory holding cost and ordering cost, and hence can increase the retailer's expected profits. In addition, we numerically investigate the sensitivity of the rebate program's effectiveness to the model parameters and illustrate its advantages over an advance-discount policy.

Yet little is known about the operations and capabilities needed for provision of business-to-business (B2B) e-services. This paper aims to make a contribution toward closing this gap. First, we develop a new construct of B2B e-service capability, a term that captures a generic set of five interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) e-service recovery, (2) e-customization, (3) ease of navigation, (4) service portfolio comprehensiveness, and (5) information richness. These combined operational abilities are associated with B2B service delivery, including its portal design, technology architecture, and mix of product and service offerings. They are posited to be necessary for delivering effective B2B e-services. We also argue that, both service orientation (SO) and customer receptivity to technology, influence B2B e-service capability. We empirically test a path model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 181 businesses that have deployed B2B e-services. We find that the influence of SO on performance is not direct but rather mediated by the e-service capability, a finding that holds for both goods producers and service providers. We suggest that a firm's SO may mitigate industrial customers' resistance toward conducting business online.

Specifically, we focus on trust building in the context of a salesperson who acts as a representative of a manufacturer and shares demand forecast information with a retailer. The actions of the salesperson affect both her immediate economic gain and her future credibility as determined by retailer's trust. Our analysis reveals that, in such environments, although salespersons of widely varying types (e.g., honest, self-serving, benevolent, loyal) lie some extent about their forecast information, they tend to be trusted in long relationships, provided their forecasting accuracy is higher than that of the retailer. Furthermore, while the presence of a salesperson can improve the profits of both the retailer and manufacturer, there are cost structures under which the manufacturer is better off without a salesperson. Finally, we make the general observation that the appropriate salesperson compensation scheme depends on her social characteristics, and the specific observation that when the salesperson cares for the retailer, the linear compensation scheme commonly suggested in the literature as the optimal compensation scheme for the salesperson is no longer optimal.

In both single-level and two-level supply chains, from the manufacturer's perspective, while information sharing is always valuable, production postponement can sometimes be detrimental. Furthermore, the value of production postponement is not merely driven by savings in inventory holding cost as postponement enables the manufacturer to avoid both excess and shortfall in production. We find that production postponement and information sharing strategies may substitute, complement, or conflict with each other, depending on the extent of the increase in the unit production cost when production is postponed. In a two-level supply chain, from the retailer's perspective, information sharing and production postponement can be beneficial or detrimental. When information sharing is beneficial to the retailer, the retailer always shares her demand information with the manufacturer voluntarily. In addition, this voluntary information sharing is truthful because inflated or deflated demand information hurts the retailer through a higher wholesale price or a stock-out. However, the retailer never shares her demand information voluntarily if the manufacturer has already adopted production postponement because production postponement and information sharing strategies always conflict with each other. Even when the retailer does not benefit from information sharing, we show that the manufacturer can always design an incentive mechanism to induce the retailer to share the demand information, irrespective of whether the manufacturer has already implemented production postponement or not. The above findings underscore the need for a careful assessment of demand uncertainty-reduction strategies before the supply chain players embark upon them.

We define quality risk as the possibility of product misfit, defect, or unconformity with the consumers perception. These notions of quality risks differ in return policy restriction, residual values, and whether it is possible to unambiguously reduce the probability of mismatch. Using a stylized two-segment market setting, we demonstrate that consumer returns are offered only when the high-segment consumers incur a higher hassle cost, and both the quality risk and the valuation of the low segment are moderate. Moreover, it is possible to wisely design the returns policy that eliminates all inappropriate returns. Furthermore, the seller with a high-quality risk may offer a refund that exceeds the selling price, which provides a theoretical ground and specific operating regime for the satisfaction guaranteed policy used in some e-tailers. In contrast, when the quality risk is relatively low, further improvement on mitigating the quality risk may not necessarily benefit the seller. Finally, we observe that the restocking fee may be non-monotonic in product quality; thus, a more generous returns policy does not necessarily indicate a lower quality risk.

At the beginning of a period, the retailer makes replenishment and pricing decisions, and at the end of a period, the retailer decides whether to dispose of ending inventory or carry it forward to the next period. The objective of the retailer is to maximize the long-run average profit. Assuming zero lead time, we propose an efficient solution approach to the problem, which is also generalized to solve three extensions to the basic model. A feature of the present study is that we consider explicitly the influence of perishability on the demand. Among the insights gathered from the numerical analysis, we find that dynamic pricing aids extending shelf life and when disposal incurs a lower cost, or even a positive salvage value, the retailer is induced to dispose earlier since the benefit of selling new inventory offsets the loss due to disposal. We also observe that the faster the perceived rate of deterioration, the lower the threshold of the ending inventory for disposal. Perhaps a bit counter-intuitive, maximizing profits does not mean eliminating disposals or expirations.

The retailers place their regular orders before the season starts. In addition to this initial order, quick response (QR) provides a retailer with an additional replenishment opportunity after demand uncertainty is resolved. The manufacturer determines the unit price for QR replenishment. We characterize the retailers ordering, and the manufacturer's pricing decisions in equilibrium when none, only one, and both of the retailers have QR ability. We study how the profitability of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the channel depend on QR and competition. We find it may be optimal for the manufacturer to offer QR to only one of the ex ante identical retailers when demand variability is sufficiently, but not overly high. The manufacturer may also find it optimal to offer QR to both or none of the retailers, depending on demand variability. Finally, while QR ability is always attractive for a retailer when competition is ignored, we find QR may prove detrimental when its impact on competition is taken into account.

In such cases, absent retail competition concerns, standard two-part tariff negotiations set the per-unit wholesale price equal to marginal cost, and require fixed transfers from the retailer to the manufacturer. In this article, we recognize that manufacturers often rely on imperfectly competitive markets for at least some inputs. Incorporating this seemingly natural feature has profound implications for manufacturerretailer negotiations since it shifts their focus from being exclusively on output markets to one that balances strategic concerns in both input and output realms. The article's main result is that the added need to discipline input prices can lead the manufacturer and retailer to write contingent contracts that are cost-plus and prescribe lump-sum slotting allowances (i.e., fixed transfer from the manufacturer to the retailer).

The firm under consideration replenishes a certain product from a set of capacitated suppliers for a price-dependent demand in each period. Under deterministic capacities, we derive a multilevel base stock list price policy and establish the optimality of cost-based supplier selection, that is, ordering from a cheaper source before more expensive ones. With general random capacities, however, neither result holds. While it is optimal to price low for a high inventory level, the optimal order quantities are not monotone with respect to the inventory level. In general, a near reorder-point policy should be followed. Specifically, there is a reorder point for each supplier such that no order is issued to him when the inventory level is above this point and a positive order is placed almost everywhere when the inventory level is below this point. Under this policy, it may be profitable to order exclusively from the most expensive source. We characterize conditions under which a strict reorder-point policy and a cost-based supplier-selection criterion become optimal. Moreover, we quantify the benefit from dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing, and the benefit from multiple sourcing, as opposed to single sourcing. We show that these two strategies exhibit a substitutable relationship. Dynamic pricing is less effective under multiple sourcing than under single sourcing, and supplier diversification is less valuable with price adjustments than without. Under limited supply, dynamic pricing yields a robust, long-term profit improvement. The value of supply diversification, in contrast, mainly comes from added capacities and is most significant in the short run.

We show that the problem can be reduced to an equivalent single-sourcing problem. However, the corresponding ordering cost is neither concave nor convex. Using the notion of quasi-convexity, we partially characterize the structure of the optimal policy and show that it can be specified by multiple thresholds which determine when to order from each supplier and how much. In contrast to previous research, which does not consider order size constraints, we show that it is optimal to simultaneously source from both suppliers when the beginning inventory level is sufficiently low. We also show that the decision to source from the low-cost supplier is not monotonic in the inventory level. Our results require that the variable costs satisfy a certain condition which guarantees quasi-convexity. However, extensive numerical results suggest that our policy is almost always optimal when the condition is not satisfied. We also show how the results can be extended to systems with multiple capacitated suppliers.

This problem can be observed in situations where a firm orders semi-finished product prior to the selling season and customizes the product in response to customer orders during the selling season. The total demand during the selling season and the lead-time required for customization are uncertain. The demand for the product depends not only on the selling price but also on the quoted lead-time. To set the quoted lead-time, the firm has to carefully balance the benefit of increasing demand as the quoted lead-time is reduced against the cost of increased tardiness. Our model enables the firm to determine the optimal selling price, quoted lead-time, and order quantity simultaneously, and provides a new set of insights to managers.

In essence, opaque selling transforms a differentiated good into a commodity. Opaque pricing has become popular in service pricing as it allows firms to sell their differentiated product at higher prices to regular brand loyal customers while simultaneously selling to non-brand loyal customers at discounted prices. We use a nested logit model in combination with logistic regression and dynamic programming to illustrate how a service firm can optimally set prices on an opaque sales channel. The choice model allows the characterization of consumer trade-offs when purchasing opaque products while the dynamic programming approach allows the characterization of the optimal pricing policy as a function of inventory and time remaining. We compare optimal prices and expected revenues when dynamic pricing is restricted to daily price changes. We provide an illustrative example using data from an opaque selling mechanism () and a Washington DC-based hotel.

Oral communication among dispatchers and production units has given way to electronic communication between production planners and these units by continuous progress in information technologies. Current production literature alludes to the idea that, collectively, these advances have paved the way for application of Just-In-Time (JIT) production concepts, which were originally developed for mass production systems, in intermittent production systems. But this literature does not actually consider the possibility. This article presents a modification to JIT procedures to make them more suitable for jumbled-flow shops. This article suggests providing real-time information about net-requirements for each product to each work center operator for setting production priorities at each work center. Simulation experiments conducted for this study show that using Net-Requirements in JIT (NERJIT) reduces customer wait time by 4560% while reducing inventory slightly. The analysis of work centers input and output stock-point inventories shows that using the information about net-requirements results in production of items that are in current demand. NERJIT results in smaller input stock-point inventory and availability of products with higher priority in the output stock-points of work centers.

Despite the attention given to team familiarity and its contingencies, prior work has focused on whether team members have worked together, not on which team members have worked together, and under what conditions. In this paper, I parse overall team familiarity to consider effects of geographic location and the hierarchical roles of team members. Using data on all software-development projects completed over 3 years at a large Indian firm in the global outsourced software services industry, I find that team familiarity gained when team members work together in the same location has a significantly more positive effect on team performance compared with team familiarity gained while members were collaborating in different locations. Additionally, I find that hierarchical team familiarity (a manager's experience with front-line team members) and horizontal team familiarity (front-line team members' experience gained with one another) have differential effects on project team performance. These findings provide insight into the relationship between team experience and team performance.

A major challenge for MTO manufacturers operating under high demand variability is to produce customized parts in time to meet internal production schedules. We present a case study of a producer of MTO offshore oil rigs that highlights the key aspects of the problem. The producer was faced with an increase in both demand and demand variability. Consequently, it had to rely heavily on subcontracting to handle production requirements that were in excess of its capacity. We focused on the manufacture of customized steel panels, which represent the main sub-assemblies for building an oil rig. We considered two key tactical parameters: the planning window of the master production schedule and the planned lead time of each workstation. Under the constraint of a fixed internal delivery lead time, we determined the optimal planning parameters. This improvement effort reduced the subcontracting cost by implementing several actions: the creation of a master schedule for each sub-assembly family of the steel panels, the smoothing of the master schedule over its planning window, and the controlling of production at each workstation by its planned lead time. We report our experience in applying the analytical model, the managerial insights gained, and how the application benefits the oil-rig producer.

The model is motivated by applications from various industries, in particular, the automobile industry, where a part supplier receives orders from both an original equipment manufacturer and the aftermarket. The product for the original equipment manufacturer is produced to stock, it has higher priority, and its demands are fully accepted. The aftermarket product is produced to order, and its demands can be either accepted or rejected. We characterize the optimal production and admission policies with a partial-linear structure, and using computational analysis, we provide insights into the benefits of the new policies. We also investigate the impact of production capacity, cost structure, and demand structure on system performance.

In this article, we investigate for the optimal leasing price and leasing duration decisions by a monopolist when the production and servicing capacity are constrained. The effect of diffusion of consumers in the installed base is considered, with the ownership of the product resting with the monopolist during the product lifecycle. The monopolist operating the installed base jointly optimizes the profits from leasing the product/service bundle along with maintenance revenues and remanufacturing savings. We formulate the manufacturer's problem as an optimal control problem and show that the optimal pricing strategy of the firm should be a skimming strategy. We also find that the effect of remanufacturing savings on the pricing decision and the length of the leasing duration changes significantly depending on the duration of the product's lifecycle. If the product lifecycle is long and remanufacturing savings are low, the firm should offer a shorter leasing duration, whereas if the remanufacturing savings are high, the firm should optimally offer a higher leasing duration. In contrast, if the time duration of the product lifecycle is low and remanufacturing savings are low, the firm prefers to offer a shorter leasing duration, whereas if the remanufacturing savings are high, the firm should optimally have a longer leasing duration. The article also shows that if the production capacity is small, the manufacturer increases the leasing duration. If the production capacity is very small, the manufacturer sets the leasing duration to be equal to the product lifecycle and does not use remanufacturing.

The retailer has to pay a fixed cost for each product included in the assortment and a variable cost per product sold. Quality levels, fixed, and variable costs are exogenously determined. Customers differ in their valuation of quality and choose the product (if any) that maximizes their utility. First, we consider a setting in which the selling prices are also fixed. We find that the optimal set of products to offer depends on the distribution of customer valuations and might include dominated products, that is, products which are less attractive than at least one other product, on every possible dimension. We develop an efficient algorithm to identify an optimal assortment. Second, we consider a setting in which the retailer also determines the selling prices. We show that in this case the optimal assortment does not include any dominated product and does not vary with the distribution of customer valuations when there is no fixed cost. We develop several efficient algorithms to identify an optimal assortment and optimally price the products. We also test the applicability of our methods with realistic data for two product categories.

We identify conditions where storage decisions have a large impact on throughput (e.g., a 20% increase in productivity) and conditions where the impact is minimal. Conditions associated with high impact are high variation in worker skill, high variation in SKU volume, and a moderate level of walking-to-picking work content per pick list.

We first consider the approach of operational statistics and review related results which enable us to maximize a priori expected profit uniformly over all parameter values, when the demand distribution is known up to the location and scale parameters. For the case of the unknown shape parameter, we first suggest a heuristic approach based on operational statistics to obtain improved ordering policies and illustrate the same for the case of a Pareto demand distribution. In more general cases where the heuristic is not applicable, we suggest linear correction and support vector regression approaches to better estimate ordering policies, and illustrate these using a Gamma demand distribution. In certain cases, our proposed approaches are found to yield significant improvements.

In our developed stylized model, a retailer sources from a supplier with uncertain lead-time to meet his stable and known demand, and the supply lead-time is composed of two random duration stages. At the completion time of the first stage, the retailer has the option to expedite a portion of the replenishment order via an alternative faster supply mode. We characterize the optimal expediting policy in terms of if and how much of the order to expedite and explore comparative statics on the optimal policy to better understand the effects of changes in the cost parameters and lead-time properties. We also study how the expediting option affects the retailer's decisions on the replenishment order (time and size of order placement). We observe that with the expediting option the retailer places larger orders closer to the start of the selling season, thus having this option serve as a substitute for the safety lead-time and allowing him to take increased advantages of economies of scale. Finally we extend the basic model by looking at correlated lead-time stages and more than two random lead-time stages.

The buyer allocates demand to the suppliers using a score function with an exponential form, which specifies the relative importance of price vs. service, in order to minimize his costs, while the suppliers choose their prices and fill rates to maximize their profits. For the case of dual-sourcing, we characterize the optimal parameter of the exponential score function, considering the impact of the buyer's decisions on the suppliers, and considering how the suppliers compete against each other to earn a portion of the buyer's demand. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium and characterize the equilibrium behavior of the system. We then consider a general number of suppliers and show that the equilibrium prices and fill rates, and the buyer's cost, are increasing in the number of suppliers. We compare these results to a model of single-sourcing, in which the buyer is the Stackelberg leader and extracts all profits from the supplier. We find that the buyer always prefers single-sourcing to multisourcing. Finally, we study a centralized system and use the results to develop a coordinating contract for the decentralized system.

The supplier's unit production cost, which characterizes his type, is only privately known to him. When trading with the retailer, the supplier demands a reservation profit that depends on his unit production cost. We model this problem as a game of adverse selection. In this model, the retailer offers a menu of contracts, each of which consists of two parameters: the ordering quantity and the supplier's share of the channel profit. We show that the optimal contract depends critically on a surrogate measurethe ratio of the types reservation profit differential to their production cost differential. An important implication from our analysis is that information asymmetry alone does not necessarily induce loss in channel efficiency. The optimal contract can coordinate the supply chain as long as the low-cost supplier's cost efficiency is neither much overvalued nor much undervalued in the outside market. We further discuss the retailer's preference of the supplier's type under different market conditions, as well as evaluate the effects of the supplier's reservation profit, the retail price, and the demand uncertainty on the optimal contract.

The firm can purchase the product either from option contracts or from the spot market. Different option contracts are offered by a set of suppliers with a two-part fee structure: a unit reservation cost and a unit exercising cost. The spot market price is random and its realization may affect the subsequent option contract prices. The firm decides the reservation quantity from each supplier and the product selling price at the beginning of each period and the number of options to exercise (inventory replenishment) at the end of the period to maximize the total expected profit over its planning horizon. We show that the optimal inventory replenishment policy is order-up-to type with a sequence of decreasing thresholds. We also investigate the optimal option-reservation policy and the optimal pricing strategy. The optimal reservation quantities and selling price are shown to be both decreasing in the starting inventory level when demand function is additive. Building upon the analytical results, we conduct a numerical study to unveil additional managerial insights. Among other things, we quantify the values of the option contracts and dynamic pricing to the firm and show that they are more significant when the market demand becomes more volatile.

Between two replenishments, a unit can be transshipped to a stocked-out retailer from the other. It arrives a transshipment time later, during which the stocked-out retailer incurs backorder cost. Without transshipment, backorder cost is incurred until the next replenishment. Since the transshipment time is shorter than the time between two replenishments, transshipments can reduce the backorder cost at the stocked-out retailer and the holding costs at the other retailer. The system is directed by a centralized inventory manager, who minimizes the long-run average cost consisting of replenishment, holding, backorder, and transshipment costs. The transshipment policy is characterized by hold-back inventory levels, which are nonincreasing in the remaining time until the next replenishment. The transshipment policy differs from those in the literature because we allow for multiple transshipments between replenishments, positive transshipment times, and backorder costs. We also discuss the challenges associated with positive replenishment time and develop upper and lower bounds of average cost in this case. Bounds are numerically shown to have an average gap of 1.1%. A heuristic solution is based on the upper bound and differs from the optimal cost by at most this gap.

One of the sequential approaches to which the simultaneous approach is compared is a so-called first-come-first-served (FCFS) approach, i.e., an approach that generates randomized production policies that do not depend on the deterioration state of the machine. However, the model formulation for this approach does not generate policies consistent with this FCFS notion. Therefore, we present a revised FCFS model and analyze its performance using an existing experimental design. The results suggest that previous work overestimates the degree to which a FCFS approach is suboptimal, and underestimates the value of simultaneously optimizing the maintenance and production decisions. Lastly, we conduct additional experiments which suggest that the joint impact of using both simultaneous optimization and a deterioration dependent production policy is quite significant.

High uncertainty in a new product introduction often leads to extreme cases of demand and supply mismatches. Pricing is an effective tool to either prevent or alleviate these problems. We study the optimal pricing decisions in the context of a product transition in which a new-generation product replaces an old one. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem and derive the optimal prices for both the old and new products. Our analysis sheds light on the pattern of the optimal prices for the two products during the transition and on how product replacement, along with several other dynamics including substitution, external competition, scarcity, and inventory, affect the optimal prices. We also determine the optimal initial inventory for each product and discuss a heuristic method.

Two important phases involved in working with technology vendors are vendor selection and vendor management. Because for both steps theory development of key decision guidelines is still immature, we use detailed case studies of 31 innovation outsourcing projects at Siemens to develop grounded theory on provider selection criteria and on project management success drivers. A selection criterion often associated with successful outsourcing is the provider's track record or previous experience. Our cases suggest that there is no standard track record for success but that a match between the client firm's outsourcing motivation and the provider's strengths appears to be a necessary condition for a successful outsourcing collaboration. As to the second phasemanaging the vendorwe identify a number of operational project success drivers. There seems to be no universal checklist, but the most important drivers seem to be contingent on the type of vendor chosen and on the maturity of the technology. We compare five provider typesuniversities, competitors, customers, start-up companies, and component suppliersand find that some success drivers are common to all providers, while others are relevant only for certain types of provider. Moreover, drivers in the case of a mature technology are more focused on successful transfer to manufacturing than on development itself. Our findings offer guidelines for innovation managers on how to select innovation providers and how to manage them during the project.

We develop a measure of seat value, called the Seat Value Index, and relate it to seat location and consumer characteristics. We implement our analysis on a proprietary data set that a professional baseball franchise in Japan collected from its customers, and provide recommendations. For instance, we find that customers seated in symmetric seats on left and right fields might derive very different valuations from the seats. We also find that the more frequent visitors to the stadium report extreme seat value less often when compared with first-time visitors. Our findings and insights remain robust to the effects of price and game-related factors. Thus, our research quantifies the significant influence of seat location on the ex-post seat value perceived by customers. Utilizing the heterogeneity in seat values at different seat locations, we provide segment-specific pricing recommendations based on a service-level objective that would limit the fraction of customers experiencing low seat value to a desired threshold.

To stimulate demand and enhance revenue, in some periods, the firm may choose to offer a part of its available inventory at a discount. As customers learn to expect such discounts, a fraction may wait rather than purchase at a regular price. A problem the firm faces is how to incorporate this waiting and learning into its revenue management decisions. To address this problem we summarize two types of learning behaviors and propose a general model that allows for both stochastic consumer demand and stochastic waiting. For the case with two customer classes, we develop a novel solution approach to the resulting dynamic program. We then examine two simplified models, where either the demand or the waiting behavior are deterministic, and present the solution in a closed form. We extend the model to incorporate three customer classes and discuss the effects of overselling the capacity and bumping customers. Through numerical simulations we study the value of offering end-of-period deals optimally and analyze how this value changes under different consumer behavior and demand scenarios.

This is despite emphasis on the need to involve all actors in the supply chain in order to best achieve the aims of EPR. In this paper, we examine the economic and environmental implications of product recovery mandates and shared responsibility within a supply chain. We use a two-echelon model consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer to determine the impacts of product collection and recycling mandates on the incentive to recycle and resulting profits in the integrated and decentralized supply chains. For the decentralized supply chain, we demonstrate how the sharing of responsibility for product recovery between the echelons can improve total supply chain profit and suggest a contract menu that can Pareto-improve profits. To examine both the economic and environmental performance associated with responsibility sharing, we propose a social welfare construct that includes supply chain profit, consumer surplus, and the externalities associated with virgin material extraction, product consumption, and disposal of nonrecycled products. Using a numerical example, we discuss how responsibility sharing may or may not improve social welfare. The results of this paper are of value to firms either anticipating or subject to product recovery legislation, and to social planners that attempt to balance economic and environmental impacts and ensure fairness of such legislation.

Yet, the assumption that remanufacturing is desirable to society has never been systematically investigated. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness and eco-efficiency of remanufacturing in the personal computer and mobile phone industries. We investigate whether remanufacturing substantially reduces the environmental impact, as measured by cumulative energy demand (CED), generated over the life cycles (LCs) of these products, and the size of any reduction. We also examine the relative eco-efficiency of remanufacturing compared with virgin manufacturing for these two products, where eco-efficiency includes both willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the products as well as the energy consumed in producing the products. Our main findings are the following. One, remanufacturing is an effective way to reduce the total energy consumed during the LCs of personal computers and mobile phones, with one notable exception, when the life spans of remanufactured products are substantially shorter than the life spans of their new counterparts. Two, a remanufactured personal computer or mobile phone is not always more eco-efficient than a corresponding new product. Three, the WTP for remanufactured personal computers and mobile phones, and consequently, their eco-efficiencies, are a function of the prices of the correspondent new products at launch and years elapsed between launch and remanufacturing. Four, remanufactured units are sold at a discount relative to the price of new personal computers and mobile phones. Five, on the whole, the market for remanufactured mobile phones is more eco-efficient than the market for new mobile phones. Six, the market for remanufactured computers is more eco-efficient than the market for new computers. Lastly, because the group of remanufactured products is heterogeneous, not all remanufactured units are more eco-efficient than the average new computer and mobile phone. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of our findings on European WEEE and WEEE-like legislation.

Each ship has a capacity constraint limiting the total number of containers it can carry and each ship visits a given set of ports following a predetermined route. Each container has a release date at its origination port, and a due date at its destination port. A container has a size 1 or size 2; size 1 represents a 1 TEU (20-foot equivalent unit) and size 2 represents 2 TEUs. The delivery time of a container is defined as the time when the ship that carries the container arrives at its destination port. We consider the problem of minimizing the maximum tardiness over all containers. We consider three scenarios with regard to the routes of the ships, namely, the ships having (i) identical, (ii) nested, and (iii) arbitrary routes. For each scenario, we consider different settings for origination ports, release dates, sizes of containers, and number of ports; we determine the computational complexity of various cases. We also provide a simple heuristic for some cases, with its worst case analysis. Finally, we discuss the relationship of our problems with other scheduling problems that are known to be open.

A longer warranty protection period can boost sales, but it may also result in dramatically increased warranty cost, if product quality is poor. To investigate how these two decisions interact with each other and influence supply chain performance, we develop a single-period model with a supplier that provides a product to an original equipment manufacturer, which in turn sells it to customers. Customer demand is random and affected by the length of the product warranty period. Warranty costs are incurred by both the supplier and the manufacturer. We analyze two different scenarios based on which party sets the warranty period: manufacturer warranty and supplier warranty. Product quality is controlled by the supplier, and the manufacturer determines the ordering quantity. We analyze these decentralized systems and provide the structural properties of the equilibrium strategies. We also compare the results of centralized and decentralized systems and identify the conditions under which one system provides a longer warranty and better product quality than the other. Our numerical study further shows that, in decentralized settings, when the warranty period is determined by the firm sharing the larger proportion of total warranty costs, the supply chain can achieve greater system-wide profit. Both parties can therefore benefit from properly delegating the warranty decision and sharing the resulting additional profit. We further design a supplier-development and buy-back contract for coordinating decentralized supply chains. Several extensions are also discussed.

The two types of retailers are asymmetric in buying power, retailing cost, and the ability to service the manufacturer's product. The wholesale prices offered through a quantity discount (QD) schedule can coordinate such a supply chain, but invite channel flow diversion type of gray trading between the dominant retailer and the fringe retailers. Our analysis is focused on how such a channel can be coordinated and the gray market activities be prevented. We propose a dynamic QD contract or a revenue-sharing contract that the manufacturer can use to fight the gray market activity. The performance of the supply chain and the manufacturer's profit under each of the two contract forms are compared and managerial guidelines are provided to help the manufacturer make a judicious choice.

In this paper, we study the potential use of two contingency strategies on top of the conventionally used time bufferstatically planned safety lead-time (SL)approach to deal with the lead-time uncertainty. These are (1) the ex-ante planning for disruption safety stock (DSS) to be released when a disruption (in this case, late delivery of the order) occurs; and (2) the ex-post dynamic emergency response (DER), which dynamically decides on the timing and size of an emergency order to be placed. Our work elaborates on the optimal parameter setting for these strategies, compares their added values when used to complement the traditional SL approach, and examines how the use of the contingency strategies affects the SL and corresponding cycle length of a periodic review system. Our research finds that: (1) the above contingency strategies reduce the reliance on the SL and are cost effective when the coefficient of variation (CV) of the uncertain lead-time is high; (2) it is important to re-optimize the SL to account for the contingency plans; and (3) re-optimization of the cycle length to account for the presence of the contingency responses, as opposed to using an EOQ-determined cycle length, does not significantly improve the cost performance. However, such re-optimization does well in the SL approach when the CV of the uncertain lead-time is high.

We define uniform quotation mode (UQM) as the strategy where a firm offers a single lead time and price quotation, and differentiated quotation mode (DQM) is where a firm offers a menu of lead times and prices for customers to choose from. Both modes are followed in practice. Firms should determine which is more profitable. We classify customers into two groups: lead time sensitive (LS) and price sensitive (PS). LS customers value lead time reduction more than PS customers. We develop mathematical models of both quotation modes and analyze them to determine the most profitable mode under specified situations as well as the best lead time and price quotations within each mode. We find that DQM is dominated by UQM whenever PS customers have positive utilities from UQM or LS customers have positive utilities from DQM. Otherwise, which quotation mode is better depends on multiple factors, such as customer characteristics (including lead time reduction valuation and product valuation of a customer, and the proportion of LS customers) and production characteristics (including the desired service level and service or production cost).

Many studies demonstrated the potential benefit of using flexible capacity at the aggregate level by treating a whole plant or a whole process as a single stage. This paper extends these analyses by studying the benefits of flexible capacity while considering the multi-stage structure of processes and consequently determining which stages should be flexible, which should be dedicated, and how much capacity to assign to each stage. We consider a two-product firm which operates in a process-to-order environment and faces uncertain demand. Each stage of the process can be designed as dedicated or flexible. Dedicated resources are highly cost efficient but limited to the single product they are exclusively designed for, whereas flexible resources are versatile to handle several products but are more expensive. Using a general mathematical formulation our analysis shows that the optimal design may have some dedicated and some flexible stages along the process. Interestingly, this decision should be decoupled from the chronological order of the stages along the process.

This value chain encompasses all stages of the entrepreneurial phenomenon, including technology commercialization, where discovery, commitment, organization, and growth must take place. We report on a literature search that identifies research questions categorized with respect to topics crucial to operations management scholars and classify these questions under each stage of this value chain. The search guides the development of an evolutionary path for the use of resources, routines, and reputation (3Rs), often lacking in this process, and enables us to propose modeling and topical gaps in the literature. We offer a framework to set up exemplars for operational tradeoffs uniquely associated with the entrepreneurial value chain. We also articulate how five contributed articles in this issue tackle some of these tradeoffs, prior to introducing four perspective pieces. We hope this discussion motivates follow-on work and triggers a significant increase in the flow of articles that make it to both entrepreneurship and operations management top-tier academic and practitioner publications.

Existing studies show that fairness perceptions have a great influence on this cooperation, but no research investigates its precise mechanisms or dynamic patterns. This study explores the development of 17 ventures that cooperated with a university-owner of technology and thereby identifies different cooperation patterns in which fairness perceptions influence the degree of cooperation. These perceptions also change over time, partly as a function of accumulated experience and learning. A system dynamics model integrates insights from existing literature with the empirical findings to reveal which cooperation mechanisms relate to venture development over time; the combinations of individual experience, fairness perceptions, and market circumstances lead to four different patterns. This model can explain changes in entrepreneurial cooperation as a result of changes in fairness perceptions, which depend on learning effects and entrepreneurial experience. Each identified cooperation pattern has implications for research and offers insights for practitioners who need to manage relationships in practice.

The problem is especially challenging when the complementary technologies have uncertain cost reduction potentials. The entrepreneurship literature suggests that startups should pursue focused strategies for various reasons, including bounded rationality and budget constraints, but generally overlooks startups entering markets with complementary technologies. The advice for mature firms investing in complementary technologies is often to diversify investment across multiple complements to manage technological uncertainty. Given competing guidance, we seek to extend the entrepreneurship literature by modeling startups' entry decisions for markets in which complementary technologies exhibit strong learning effects. We find that, consistent with the extant entrepreneurship literature, startups generally achieve higher expected returns by channeling their integration investment to only one complementary technology. However, the mechanisms driving our results differ significantly by hinging on nonlinear feedback effects that occur when firms concentrate integration investment in only one complementary technology. Interestingly, this focused strategy often does not yield the highest market share or the lowest likelihood of bankruptcy. We characterize the situations under which each finding holds and describe the implications of these findings for theory, practice, and policy.

Commercial success of such technology products requires astute business practices related to product line design, price discrimination, and launch timing. We examine these issues for a platform firm that serves two marketslabeled as user and developer marketssuch that the size of each market positively impacts participation in the other. In addition, our model allows for sequential unfolding of consumer and developer participation, and for uncertainty regarding developer participation. We demonstrate that product versioning is an especially attractive strategy for platform firms, that is, the trade-off between market size and margins is tilted in the direction of more versions. However, when expanding the product line carries substantial fixed costs (e.g., marketing cost, cost of additional plant, increased distribution cost), then the uncertainty in developer participation adversely impacts the firm's ability to offer multiple versions. We show that for established firms with lower uncertainty about developer participation, the choice is essentially between an expanded or minimal product line. Startups and firms that are entering a new product category are more likely to benefit from a wait and see deferred expansion strategy.

Employing a sample of 728 biotech firms and their partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, we find that while portfolio depth and scope separately have positive impact on success, the relationship between portfolio scope and success is additionally moderated by portfolio depth. Further, insights from post hoc interviews also suggest that though it is challenging for entrepreneurial firms to incorporate both depth and scope in alliance partnerships, those that optimally combine both can achieve higher TIC success.

On the basis of operations management and entrepreneurship literature, we develop a contingency framework of operational capabilities especially appropriate at different life phases of a new venture's evolution. We expect that in the first years of a new venture's life, entrepreneurs should emphasize high inventory turnover to preserve working capital, support customer responsiveness, and aid firm adaptability. As new ventures grow, entrepreneurs should emphasize internal working capital generation via larger gross margins to support production ramp-up. Later, new venture entrepreneurs should emphasize employee productivity to buttress sustainable volume production. We analyze a 6-year longitudinal sample of 812 Swedish manufacturing new ventures using a gamma frailty-based Cox regression. The findings show that specific operational capabilities, while always supporting new venture survival, have exceptional influence in specific new venture life phases. The three hypotheses are confirmed, suggesting that higher inventory turnover, gross margin, and employee productivity further increase new venture survival likelihoods, respectively, in the venture's start-up, growth, and stability phases. This suggests a phased-capabilities approach to new venture survival. This study contributes to operations management and entrepreneurship theory and practice, and sets a foundation for future research on operations strategy for new ventures.

Much of the research published in the pages of Production and Operations Management deals with management under uncertainty. The shared concerns over the impacts of multiple types of uncertainty suggest that research on Operations Management (OM) can play a role in the development of theory in entrepreneurship. We discuss aspects of such a role from two perspectives. First, we consider several topics in the OM literature that have clear applications or parallels in entrepreneurship. These topics include innovation, the management of technology, new product development, flexibility, and hedging strategies. Understanding these topical connections should aid in the development of tools and applications central to the practice of entrepreneurship. On another level, when we consider how the approaches to many of these topics in OM are grounded in theory adapted from Operations Research and Economics we argue that these same roots can be used as starting points for the development of theory in entrepreneurship. As examples, we will argue that the theoretical bases supporting robust optimization, stochastic dynamic programming, and even Total Quality Management can also serve as foundations of theories about the roles, practice, and behaviors of entrepreneurs.

Second, we describe how knowledge enables the entrepreneur to make decisions under uncertainty such as determining which opportunity to pursue. For Phase 3 of the life cycle, we explore the challenges of managing knowledge during the development of the product or technology including the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

I argue that a narrower positioning of POM in the past is responsible for its perceived limited utility to growth firms and global economies. POM at its core is about doing more with less, which is very well aligned with the context and needs of resource-constrained entrepreneurial companies. My discussion is focused on how the research paradigm of POM is and can be relevant to meeting the emerging challenges of growth companies of tomorrow. Specifically, I examine how POM can help meet the needs of these organizations to become scalable and sustainable. The objective is to stimulate thought and discussion and encourage early-stage POM scholars to seriously consider the contexts of technology commercialization, entrepreneurship, and growth companies as avenues for future research.

Knowledge work is considered to be distributed whenever key decisions for execution of the project cut across organizational boundaries, as occurs under outsourcing, offshoring, or open-source arrangements. The growth of such arrangements in recent years is well documented. Nonetheless, research into maintaining the coherence of a DKW project from initiation to customer delivery, often referred to as supply chain integration, project or systems integration, or simply integration, is relatively new. We first review the relevant literature from operations, service, and information management, organizational theory, and engineering design, focusing on the key decisions identified by this literature in relation to the contracting, organization, work, and information infrastructure design of a knowledge work project. We then attempt to open the black box of integration by inductively organizing these key decisions. Finally, we contrast this approach with prior research frameworks and identify key topics for future study.

The explosive growth of open innovation intermediary networks, such as InnoCentive or Linked-in, enables the rapid pairing of firms seeking knowledge to address a wide range of business challenges (seekers) with other firms or individuals who already have relevant knowledge (solvers or knowledge brokers). These intermediary networks allow procurement departments to source codified and un-codified knowledge from firms or individuals outside their traditional supplier networks using one-off transactional relationships. Although sourcing ideas in this way theoretically poses problems for knowledge search and transfer, we have found that companies can draw on processes and integration mechanisms developed by procurement and design engineering to develop effective organizational learning routines. These routines are strategically vital to source new ideas through open innovation using intermediary networks and create competitive advantage.

Although prior research has documented that dispersion among project teams has an adverse effect on project performance, the role of IT as an enabler of communication to bridge the spatial distance among team members in distributed networks has not been empirically studied. We focus on the role of IT as a moderator of the relationship between team dispersion and project performance using projects as the unit of analysis. We find that IT mitigates the negative effect of team dispersion on project performance, especially in high information volume projects. Our central contribution is the development of an empirically tested model to improve the understanding of the operational impact of IT as a vehicle to bridge spatial dispersion among distributed teams that are engaged in knowledge-intensive work.

Product modularity, either in concert with or independent of such integration, can also produce flexibility for firms within a supply chain. In this proof-of-concept research, we explore whether the supply chain network affects each constituent firm's market valuation and how decisions regarding the level of supply chain integration and the usage of product modularity are associated with the value of the supply chain. We develop a method to identify and measure the supply chain's effect on each constituent firm's market valuation. Results indicate that greater integration is associated with a higher supply chain valuation, whereas increasing aggregated product modularity across the supply chain relates to a lower supply chain value. However, when combined, the interaction of aggregated product modularity and supply chain integration is positively associated with the supply chain's valuation.

For large organizations that design and develop complex products, this geographic distribution has added a new layer of complexity to product development operations. In this empirical study of a large auto manufacturer, we examine the operational performance implications of splitting the design of vehicle subsystems across multiple geographic locations. Our results indicate that global distribution diminishes the chance of completing tasks on time and degrades subsystem design quality. Finally, by examining the interplay between subsystem centrality and global distribution, we found that higher centrality in the product architecture amplifies the impact of global distribution on subsystem error rates.

It has a long history of use and is a formally prescribed procedure by a number of prominent standards organizations. In addition, it's popular use has evolved as a less formal and widely interpreted tool in the area of Lean/Six Sigma (LSS) process improvement. This paper investigates one of the most important issues related to FMEA practicethe quality of individual vs. group performance in ranking failure modes. In particular, we compare FMEA rankings generated by: (i) individuals, (ii) group consensus, and (iii) non-collaborative aggregation of group input (a synthesized group ranking). We find that groups outperform individuals and that synthetic groups perform as well as group consensus. We explain the implications of this result on the coordination of the design of products and processes amongst distributed organizations. The increasing distribution of product design efforts, both in terms of geography and different organizations, presents an opportunity to improve coordination using distributed synthetic group-based FMEA.

The quality management (QM) literature, however, has focused mostly on QM within a single firm. Thus, the need for data-driven research on managing quality with outsourced production is evident. We investigate the use and effectiveness of external failure penalties and audits of CMs' facilities to manage inter-firm quality. Building on agency theory and extant QM literature, this study addresses two research questions: (i) whether the control mechanisms of quality audits and contractual external quality failure penalties are substitutes or complements in use and (ii) whether they are substitutes or complements in their effectiveness at aligning the quality interests of customers and their CMs. Our analysis uses dyadic data gathered from brand-owning firms and their CMs representing 95 contract manufacturing relationships in Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated industries. The results indicate that more severe external failure penalties correspond to a lower use of facility audits (i.e., they are substitutes-in-use). We also find that both external failure penalties and facility audits have a unique positive effect on the CM's perception of relative quality importance. Finally, some evidence supports the hypothesis that each mechanism is more effective in the presence of the other (i.e., they are complements-in-effectiveness).

While there exist several studies (and modeling applications) for work distribution and allocation for manufacturing and supply chain networks, those related to product development organizations are limited to qualitative suggestions such as offshoring of modular tasks. However, most PD efforts are characterized by significant complexity in information sharing and information dependency among PD tasks (represented by coupling in the system architecture of the firm), thus preventing the identification of modular tasks. Also, redesigning the architecture to introduce modularity has associated risks of costs and product integrity. We demonstrate a methodology to organize work distribution globally in an industrial setting, utilizing the design structure matrix to quantify the system architecture of the firm. Our optimization results show significant cost savings through a restructured PD organization. On analysis of the results, we make two significant observations: (a) while offshoring based on modularity is generally appropriate, it is not the whole answer, as there exists a trade-off between the efficiency of performing specific PD tasks at the offshore location and the modularity of the task; and (b) firms should successively increase work allocation to the offshore location, benefiting from capability improvements through learning effects.

We recognize that learning from manufacturing experience has many advantages. Consistent with the literature, we assume both the buyer and supplier realize reductions in their respective production costs in period 2 due to volume-based learning from period 1 production. In addition, we introduce another learning concept, the future value, to capture the buyer's benefits of transferring current manufacturing experience for the design and development of future products and technologies. In contrast to the literature, we allow the supplier two mechanisms to impact the buyer's outsourcing decision: price and the investment in integration process improvement (IPI) that reduces the buyer's unit cost of integration. IPI may include the investment in new materials, specialized technology, or the re-design of the integration process. Conditions are given whereby the buyer partially outsources component demand as opposed to fully outsourcing or fully producing in-house. Furthermore, conditions are given characterizing when the supplier's price and investment in IPI are substitute strategies versus complements. Both analytic and numerical results are presented.

In our model, a profit-maximizing monopolistic firm facing price-dependent demand selects emissions control technology, production quantity, and price in response to the tax, subsidy, and rebate levels set by the regulator. The available technologies vary in environmental efficiency as well as in the fixed and variable costs. Both the optimal policy for the firm and the social-welfare maximizing policy for the regulator are analyzed. We find that the firm's reaction to an increase in taxes may be non-monotone: while an initial increase in taxes may motivate a switch to a greener technology, further tax increases may motivate a reverse switch. For the regulator, we compare the social welfare achievable in the centralized system (which serves as an upper bound) to the highest level achievable under different classes of environmental policies. If the regulator is limited to a tax-only policy, then when the regulator is moderately concerned with environmental impacts, the tax level that maximizes social welfare simultaneously motivates the choice of clean technology and closes the gap to the upper bound; however, both low and high levels of societal environmental concerns may lead to the choice of dirty technology and significant welfare losses as compared to the centralized case. Supplementing the environmental taxation with fixed cost subsidies and consumer rebates can eliminate this effect, expanding the range of parameters over which the green technology is chosen and often closing the welfare gap to the centralized solution.

Our method is motivated by the permanent income hypothesis in economics, which states that the amount of consumer spending and the mix of spending between discretionary and necessity items depend on the returns achieved on equity portfolios held by consumers. Taking as input forecasts from other sources, such as equity analysts or time-series models, we construct a market-based forecast by augmenting the input forecast with one additional variable, lagged return on an aggregate financial market index. For this, we develop and estimate a martingale model of joint evolution of sales forecasts and the market index. We show that the market-based forecast achieves an average 15% reduction in mean absolute percentage error compared with forecasts given by equity analysts at the same time instant on out-of-sample data. We extensively analyze the performance improvement using alternative model specifications and statistics. We also show that equity analysts do not incorporate lagged financial market returns in their forecasts. Our model yields correlation coefficients between retail sales and market returns for all firms in the data set. Besides forecasting, these results can be applied in risk management and hedging.

Where once clear distinctions between wholesale suppliers and retail competitors existed, now an era of blurring boundaries has emerged. This transformation has been marked by the introduction of online channels for suppliers to provide products directly to consumers while, at the same time, traditional retailers too persist. Thus, retailers are both wholesale customers and retail competitors of many manufacturers. The consequences of the rapid emergence of instances of such partial forward integration by suppliers are not yet fully known. To this end, we study how partial forward integration can affect competing firms' strategic investments. We find that integration shifts the environment from being one in which firms invest to undercut retail rivals to one in which firms invest more in boosting demand, even that of their competitors. A case in point is the tendency for a manufacturer to invest broadly in brand promotion (benefiting both itself and its retail competitor), rather than heavy promotion of its own sales channel. The shift in the nature of strategic investments arising from partial forward integration implies that such integration can benefit firms and consumers alike, even the firm which finds itself reliant on a competitor for supplies.

They compare performance during a period against a contracted service level and penalize outcomes exceeding some allowed deviation. SLAs have a number of design characteristics that need careful tuning to ensure that incentives are properly aligned. However, there is little theoretical research in this area. Using an example of an SLA for outsourcing inventory management, we make a number of recommendations. First it is preferable, if possible, that penalties be proportional to the underperformance rather than lump-sum ones. This goes a long way towards mitigating strategic (gaming) behavior by the supplier. Second, it might be thought that giving bonuses for good performance rather than penalties for bad performance are essentially identical apart from the former being a more positive approach to management. This turns out to be incorrect in the case of large percentage service rate targets and that penalties will normally be preferred by the buying firm. Third, in order not to incorrectly penalize underperformance resulting purely from noise rather than supplier efforts, management might think it best to make allowed deviations from the target generous. Again intuition is not a helpful guide here: for proportional penalties, acceptable performance deviations should be close to the target. Although these results come from a particular inventory application, it is likely that the lessons are applicable to SLAs in general.

I fully characterize the manufacturer's optimal selling mechanism for varying degrees of retailer asymmetry and competition intensity. I find that under certain conditions, the manufacturer is better off selling a larger quantity through the high-cost (or low-demand potential) retailer. I also show how the optimal mechanism can be implemented using a menu of two-part tariffs with quantity controls.

In this study, the decision problem of a farmer associated with allocating his land among different crops with varying water requirements is considered, given that a subset of the crops may be associated with a forward contract that is being offered by a buyer. The problem includes a decision to acquire a certain amount of irrigation water capacity prior to the season and to allocate this capacity as irrigation water to be applied during the season to each of the crops selected. Rainfall in the growing season and the market price of each crop at the end of the season are considered to be random variables. Two stochastic programming models are developed to consider facets of this problem and to understand how contracts that reduce market price uncertainty from the problem may change the farmer's decision. The structural properties of these models are discussed, and selected implications are illustrated through an application to data from the Ganganagar district in Rajasthan, India.

We extend the concept of a bottleneck to networks with heterogeneous, flexible servers. In contrast with a network with dedicated servers, the bottlenecks are not a priori obvious, but can be determined by solving a number of linear programming problems. Unlike the dedicated server case, we find that a bottleneck may span several nodes in the network. We then identify some characteristics of desirable flexibility structures. In particular, the chosen flexibility structure should not only achieve the maximal possible capacity (corresponding to full server flexibility), but should also have the feature that the entire network is the (unique) system bottleneck. The reason is that it is then possible to shift capacity between arbitrary nodes in the network, allowing the network to cope with demand fluctuations. Finally, we specify when certain flexibility structures (in particular chaining, targeted flexibility, and the N and W structures from the call center literature) possess these desirable characteristics.

In the first period, the product is new; in the next, it becomes old. The new product is perceived by customers to have a higher quality than the old product. Every period, the retailer makes three decisions: prices for the new and old products and how much new product to order. I first show, with some simple cases, that demand uncertainty can make the sale of the old product profitable. I then consider a more realistic case with dynamic demand substitution among customers. I recognize that the retailer's decisions may be constant or may vary across different periods, under different contexts. For instance, varying the price of the new product can sometimes be difficult due to the negative impact it generates among customers. I find that (i) the benefit obtained from selling the old product with constant decisions is much higher than the benefit from allowing all the decisions to vary; (ii) the former benefit increases with a higher procurement cost, a higher quality of the new product, and higher demand volatility; however, the latter benefit is non-monotone in these parameters; (iii) most of the latter benefit can be obtained by just changing the order quantity; and (iv) as the inventory of the old product increases, when all the decisions vary, the optimal price of the new product may increase or decrease.

We have access to a number of products to satisfy the demand over a finite selling horizon. Given that customers choose among the set of offered products according to the multinomial logit model, we need to decide which sets of products to offer over the selling horizon and how many units of each product to stock so as to maximize the expected profit. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear program, where the decision variables correspond to the stocking quantity for each product and the duration of time that each set of products is offered. This nonlinear program is intractable due to its large number of decision variables and its nonseparable and nonconcave objective function. We use the structure of the multinomial logit model to formulate an equivalent nonlinear program, where the number of decision variables is manageable and the objective function is separable. Exploiting separability, we solve the equivalent nonlinear program through a dynamic program with a two dimensional and continuous state variable. As the solution of the dynamic program requires discretizing the state variable, we study other approximate solution methods. Our equivalent nonlinear program and approximate solution methods yield insights for good offer sets.

This problem is often faced by large retail chains that carry private-label products. We formulate this problem as a convex-mixed integer program and show that it is strongly NP-hard. We determine a lower bound by applying a Lagrangian relaxation and show that this bound outperforms the standard convex programming relaxation while being computationally efficient. We also establish a worst-case error bound for the Lagrangian relaxation. We then develop heuristics to generate feasible solutions. Our computational results indicate that our convex programming heuristic yields feasible solutions that are close to optimal with an average suboptimality gap at 3.4%.

A key decision in this down-market stretch strategy is the introduction time. High inventory cost is pervasive in such industries, but its impact has long been ignored during the presale planning stage. This study takes a first step toward filling this gap. We propose an integrated inventory (supply) and diffusion (demand) framework and analyze how inventory cost influences the introduction timing of product-line extensions, considering substitution effect among successive generations. We show that under low inventory cost or frequent replenishment ordering policy, the optimal introduction time indeed follows the well-known now or never rule. However, sequential introduction becomes optimal as the inventory holding gets more substantial or the product life cycle gets shorter. The optimal introduction timing can increase or decrease with the inventory cost depending on the marketplace setting, requiring a careful analysis.

We demonstrate that whether a firm benefits from its power depends on the expected demand model but not on demand shock model. A firm benefits from its power only for linear but not for constant elasticity expected demand. The impact of power structure on supply chain efficiency depends on the models of both expected demand and demand shock. With additive shock, supply chain efficiency is highest (lowest) when neither firm dominates for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With multiplicative shock, the supply chain efficiency is highest with a power retailer (manufacturer) for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. The manufacturer always benefits from a reduction in demand uncertainty. However, the retailer loses (benefits) from demand uncertainty reduction for linear (constant elasticity) expected demand. With a power retailer, the retail price is always on the higher end for linear expected demand, and the customer service level is the lowest for constant elasticity expected demand. Consequently, consumers do not necessarily benefit from a power retailer.

The supply chain faces several factors, including multiple products, multiple warehouses, production constraints, high transportation costs, and limited storage at the production facility. This problem is motivated by the supply chain structure at Amy's Kitchen, one of the leading producers of natural and organic foods in the United States. We develop an enhanced myopic two-stage approach for this problem. The first stage determines the production plan and uses a heuristic, and the second stage determines the warehouse allocation plan and uses a non-linear optimization model. This two-stage approach is repeated every period and incorporates look-ahead features to improve its performance in future periods. We validate our model using actual data from one factory at Amy's Kitchen and compare the performance of our model to that of the actual operation. We find that our model significantly reduces both inventory levels and stockouts relative to those of the actual operation. In addition, we identify a lower bound on the total costs for all feasible solutions to the problem and measure the effectiveness of our model against this lower bound. We perform sensitivity analysis on some key parameters and assumptions of our modeling approach.

In this study, we study a two-period model in which the firm may create rationing in either period. In the anticipation of possible disappointment due to stock-outs, strategic customers decide when to purchase and the firm determines the prices and rationing levels in each period. We explore the impact of disappointment aversion on customers' strategic purchasing behavior and the firm's pricing and rationing decisions. Without disappointment aversion, it is optimal for the firm to adopt a uniform pricing policy without rationing. However, when strategic customers are averse to disappointment, a firm may be able to increase profits with an appropriate level of rationing. We analyze both the mark-up and mark-down policies. We show that, in a mark-down scenario, the firm always benefits from disappointment aversion behavior by using an appropriate level of rationing in a low-price period. However, in a mark-up scenario, whether it is beneficial for the firm to induce disappointment aversion behavior depends on how customers frame payoffs in different periods when forming utilities. Particularly, when customers compartmentalize payoffs in different periods to form utilities, the firm should not induce disappointment aversion behavior.

The existing literature on economics of net neutrality focuses only on the supply side of the market, that is, a broadband service provider (BSP) may charge content providers for priority delivery of their content to consumers. In this article, we explore a complete spectrum of broadband network management options based on both the supply and demand sides of the market. We find that although the BSP always prefers the non-neutral network management options, it does not always discriminate both sides of the market. From the social planner's perspective, we find that some network management options maximize the social welfare under certain market conditions while other options reduce the social welfare. Using the terminology from a recent Federal Communications Commission report and order, we categorize the social welfare maximizing options as reasonable network management and the social welfare reducing options as unreasonable discrimination. We also identify conditions under which the BSP's network management choices deviate from the social optimum. These conditions help establish the criteria under which the social planner might wish to regulate the BSP's actions.

In this study, we attempt to further understand the strategic impact of low-cost outsourcing on manufacturers' profitability by investigating the contractual form of outsourcing agreements and the industry structure of the upstream supply market. We consider a two-tier supply chain system, consisting of two competing manufacturers, who have the option to produce in-house or to outsource to an upstream supplier with lower cost. To reach an outsourcing agreement, each manufacturer engages in bilateral negotiation with her supplier, who may be an exclusive supplier or a common supplier serving both manufacturers. Our analysis shows that wholesale-price contracts always mitigate the competition between manufacturers regardless of whether they compete with price or quantity. In contrast, two-part tariffs intensify the competition when the manufacturers compete with quantity, but soften it when they compete with price. As a result, when outsourcing with two-part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn lower profits than they would from in-house production, although the suppliers are more cost efficient. This suggests that managers have to be wary about the downside of using coordinating contracts such as two-part tariffs when pursuing low-cost outsourcing strategies. Our analysis also sheds some light on the profitability of using an exclusive supplier for outsourcing. When outsourcing with wholesale-price contracts, the competing manufacturers are better off outsourcing to an exclusive supplier. However, when outsourcing with two-part tariffs, the manufacturers may earn higher profits by outsourcing to a common supplier than to an exclusive one when the manufacturers' bargaining power is sufficiently strong (weak) under quantity (price) competition.

A Tale of Two Price Partitioning Strategies in Online Retailing	WOS:000322019400003	retail; E-commerce pricing strategy; price partitioning; free shipping; shipping and handling costs	DISPERSION; DECISIONS; INTERNET; COMPETITION; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY; MARKETS; SHOPBOT; IMPACT	4	In this article, we study the price partitioning decisions of online retailers regarding shipping and handling (S&H) fees. Specifically, we analyze two partitioning formats used by retailers in this context. In the first scenario, retailers present customers with a price that is partitioned into a product price and a separate S&H surcharge (the PS strategy); in the second, customers are offered free shipping through a non-partitioned format where the product price already includes the shipping cost (the ZS strategy). We first develop a stylized game-theoretic model that captures the competitive dynamics between (and within) these two formats. Analysis of the model provides insights into how both firm and product level characteristics drive a retailer's strategic choice regarding which partitioning format to adopt and, hence, determines the equilibrium market structure in terms of proportion of ZS and PS retailers. Subsequently, we conduct empirical analyses, based on product and S&H prices data for two different product categories (digital cameras and printers) collected from online retailers, to validate all the results of our theoretical model. We establish that PS retailers charge lower product prices than ZS ones, but the total price (product + S&H) charged is higher for the first group. The S&H charge for PS retailers can be significantit is, on average, 5.4% (printers) and 3.0% (digital cameras) for our two product categories. Furthermore, retailers which are popular and/or face risky cost environment are more likely to opt for the ZS strategy, while retailers whose portfolio mostly includes large or heavy products with high cost (S&H)-to-price ratios usually choose the PS strategy. Lastly, our empirical study also illustrates that the price adjustment behavior of retailers is affected by their shipping-fee policiesfor example, ZS retailers change their product prices almost 1.5 times more frequently than PS ones.

The retailer either salvages returned products or resells them as open-box items at a discount. We develop a model in which the retailer decides on the quantity to procure, the price for new products, the refund amount, as well as the price of returned products when they are sold as open-box. Our model captures important features of MBG sales including demand uncertainty, consumer valuation uncertainty, consumer returns, the sale of returned products as open-box items, and consumer choice between new and returned products and possibility of exchanges when restocking is considered. We show that selling with MBGs increases retail sales and profit. Furthermore, the second-sale opportunity created by restocking returned products enables the retailer to generate additional revenues. Our analysis identifies the ideal conditions under which this practice is most beneficial to the retailer. Offering an MBG without restocking increases the new product price. We show that if the retailer decides to resell the returned items as open-box, the price of the new product further increases, while open-box items are sold at a discount. On the other hand, customers enjoy more generous refunds along with lower restocking fees. The opportunity to resell returned products also generally decreases the initial stocking levels of the retailer. Our extensive numerical study substantiates the analytical results and sharpens our insights into the drivers of performance of MBG policies and their impact on retail decisions.

Record inaccuracies are assumed to arrive via an error process that perturbs physical inventory but is unobserved by the inventory manager. The inventory manager maintains a probability distribution around the physical inventory level that he updates based on sales observations using Bayes Theorem. The focus of this study is on understanding, approximating, and evaluating optimal forward-looking replenishment in this environment. By analyzing one- and two-period versions of the problem, we demonstrate several mechanisms by which the error process and associated record inaccuracy can impact optimal replenishment. Record inaccuracy generally brings an incentive for a myopic manager to increase stock to buffer the added uncertainty. On the other hand, a forward-looking manager will stock less than a myopic manager, in part to improve information content for future decisions. Using an approximate partially observed dynamic programming policy and associated bound, we numerically corroborate our analytical findings and measure the effectiveness of an intelligent myopic heuristic. We find that the myopic heuristic is likely sufficiently good in practical settings targeting high service levels.

Typically, far less information characterizes retail. Here, an extreme environment of information shortfall is examined. The environment is technically termed unattended points of sale, but colloquially called vending machines. Once inventory is loaded into a machine, information on demand and inventory level is not observed until the scheduled reloading date. Technological advances and business process changes have drawn attention to the value of information (VOI) in retail inventory in many venues. Moreover, technology is now available that allows unattended points of sale to report inventory information. Capturing the value of this information requires changes in current business practice. We demonstrate the value of capturing information analytically in an environment with restrictive demand assumptions. Experiments in an environment with realistic demand assumptions and parameter values show that the VOI depends greatly on operating characteristics and can range from negligible effects to increasing profitability 30% or more in actual practice.

Thus, inventory durability and transit lags cause managers to deviate from inventory decision optimality. Durability creates a large increase in order volatility because players adjust orders insufficiently to reflect current inventory and backlogs, much as they adjust orders insufficiently to reflect holding and backlog costs in newsvendor studies (e.g., Schweitzer and Cachon 2000). Transit lags exacerbate non-optimal ordering by interfering with players' ability to correct prior errors. Our results suggest that non-optimal inventory decisions can be driven by inventory and supply chain characteristics, even in the absence of the coordination and information sharing problems studied by Croson etal. (2005) and Sterman (1989a,b). We also examine the influence of features related to personality. We find little evidence that the interactive effects of durability and transit lags are altered by need for cognition, impulsiveness, or locus of control, suggesting that these features make supply chain management extremely difficult. These results imply that retailers and their upstream partners must consider the characteristics of their product and supply chains when interpreting demand signals received from downstream partners.

Prior empirical research, however, shows that retailer inventory records are inherently inaccurate. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enables visibility into the movement of inventories in the supply chain. Using two different field experiments, the current research investigates the effectiveness of this visibility in reducing retail store inventory record inaccuracy (IRI). Study 1 used an interrupted time-series design and involved daily physical counts of all products in one category in 13 stores (8 treatments and 5 controls) of a major global retailer over 23weeks. Results indicate a significant decrease in IRI of approximately 26% due to RFID-enabled visibility. Using an untreated control group design with pre-test and post-test, Study 2 expands the number of categories to five and the number of stores to 62 (31 treatment and 31 control stores). Results show that the effectiveness of RFID in reducing IRI varies by category (ranging from no statistically significant improvement to 81%). Results also suggest that RFID ameliorates the effects of known determinants of IRI and provide the key insight that the technology is most effective for product categories characterized by these determinants.

In this article, we study retailer-initiated strategies to increase consumer valuation for a product under duopoly. In such a setting, it is possible that a consumer's valuation may be increased by one retailer; however, the consumer may decide to buy the product from the competitor. We consider a two-stage game where retailers first decide whether to invest in improvements in customer valuation and then engage in price competition. We computationally explore the Nash equilibria in terms of both investment and pricing. We find that in the majority of cases retailers price in a manner to discourage their local customers to buy from the competitor. Next, we focus on the pricing game and theoretically characterize the pricing Nash equilibrium. We find that a retailer could overcome competitive effects by improving consumer valuation beyond a certain threshold. We also find that a retailer who does not invest could benefit from competition in situations where his competitor increases consumer valuation beyond a threshold. Finally, we explore through a computational study the Nash equilibria of the two-stage game using an alternate model to establish the robustness of our findings.

We analyze the resulting dynamic substitution problem in a retail environment, where customers serve themselves from the store shelves, such that the sequence of customer arrivals affects how scarce products are allocated to customers.

We characterize environments where the sequence of customer arrivals can have a substantial impact on profitability.

More specifically, when self-service terminals are used as part of customers' checkout processes in retail operations without the explicit involvement of retailers as the direct service providers, inter-customer interactions become a significant managerial issue. In this article, we examine the impact of inter-customer interactions at retail self-service terminals on customers' service quality perceptions and repeat purchase intentions at retail stores. We conduct a scenario-based experimental design (N=674) using a 2x2 factorial design in which inter-customer interactions are divided into positive vs. negative and occur during the waiting or during the actual transaction stages of self-services at a retail store. We use attribution theory to develop the hypotheses. The results demonstrate that, through their interactions, fellow customers can exert influences on a focal customer's quality perceptions and repeat purchasing intentions toward a retail store. Furthermore, these influences were impacted by how customers attribute blame or assign responsibility toward the retail store. Service operations managers should leverage these interactions by designing into self-service settings the capacities and interfaces that are best suited for customers' co-production of their self-service experiences.

When a replenishment order for a given item arrives at a retail store, it may not fit on the allocated shelf space, making backroom storage necessary. In this article, we introduce the backroom effect (BRE) as a consequence of misalignment of case pack size, shelf space, and reorder point. This misalignment results from the fragmented nature of inventory policy decision making in the retail industry and affects basic trade-offs in inventory models. We specify conditions under which the BRE exists, quantify the expected amount of backroom inventory, derive an optimal short-term inventory policy, and assess the impact of the BRE on the optimal inventory policy and total costs. Our results indicate that ignoring the BRE leads to artificially high reorder points and higher total costs. The paper concludes with a discussion of theoretical and managerial implications.

The efficient execution of the in-store logistics related to such fast-moving, sensitive, and essential items is challenging and crucial for grocery retailers' sales, profits, and image. In our empirical study, we survey in-store logistics processes in 202 grocery supermarkets and hypermarkets belonging to a major retail chain in central Europe. Using a data envelopment analysis (DEA) and simulation, we facilitate process benchmarking. In particular, we identify ways of improving in-store logistics processes by showing the performance impacts of different managerial strategies and tactics. The DEA results indicate different efficiency levels for different store formats; the hybrid store format of the small hypermarket exhibits a comparatively worse performance in the analyzed execution of in-store logistics processes. The process simulation analysis reveals that the strategic and tactical design of in-store logistics processes (such as store locations/layouts, capacity management, reorder time, order period, and safety stock factors) lead to substantial service performance improvements (such as higher on-shelf availability combined with reduced inventory obsolescence costs). The results also show marginal improvements in the performance figures when delivery delays and damage to products are reduced.

In this article, we advance understanding on where such design changes can be most effective economically to the firm and examine their corresponding environmental consequences. We consider a profit maximizing firm (newsvendor) deciding on the production quantity as well as its environmentally focused design efforts. We focus our results along the two dimensions of demand characteristics and life-cycle environmental impact levels, specifically functional vs. innovative products, and higher manufacturing stage environmental impact vs. higher use stage environmental impact. We also discuss the environmental impact of overproduction and how it relates to the different types of products and their salvage options. We find that although the environmental impact per unit always improves when firms use eco-efficient or demand-enhancing innovations, the total environmental impact can either increase or decrease due to increased production quantities. We identify the conditions for such cases by looking at the environmentally focused design efforts needed to compensate for the increase in production. We also show that the environmental impact of overproduction plays an important role in the overall environmental impact of the firm. We conclude by applying our model to different product categories.

In this study, we analyze the optimal decisions of a firm when a substance within its product is identified as potentially hazardous. Although the substance is not currently regulated, regulation may occur in the future. Therefore, the firm must devise a strategy for the development and implementation of a replacement substance. In an environment where replacement costs can be millions of dollars, regulation is uncertain, and both consumer and non-governmental organization pressures exist, a carefully developed plan that balances costs and risks is critical for a firm. Our results demonstrate that as long as a threat of regulation exists, a firm should always dedicate resources toward developing a replacement substance. However, it is not always optimal for a firm to implement a developed replacement. Regarding competitive dynamics, we find that competition between firms can offset a low chance of a shift in consumer perception about a substance and compel firms to replace; however, competition can lead to inefficient outcomes in which firms incur avoidable costs to implement ahead of potential regulation.

We consider three general forms of product recovery: (i) when product recovery reuses (after reprocessing) quality inducing components or material (e.g., remanufacturing), (ii) when product recovery does not reuse quality inducing components or material but it is overall profitable (e.g., cell phone recycling), and (iii) when product recovery is costly (but mandated by legislation, e.g., recycling of small appliances in the European Union). Using a stylized economic model, we show that the form of product recovery, recovery cost structure, and the presence of product take-back legislation play an important role in quality choice. Generally speaking, product recovery increases the firm's quality choice, except for some instances of recovery form (ii). In addition, we find that product take-back legislation can lead to higher quality choice as opposed to voluntary take-back. We further demonstrate that both the firm and the consumers benefit from recovery form (ii), while both are worse off with recovery form (iii). However, environmental implications of the three recovery modes differ from their impact on consumer surplus and firm profit. While recovery forms (i) and (iii) reduce consumption and increase environmental benefits, the same is not true with recovery form (ii), which can increase consumption, potentially resulting in higher environmental impact.

We consider how the rate of this required innovation, which might be fast or slow depending on the product, affects reuse decisions. We consider two types of reuseremanufacturing to original specifications, and upgrading used items by replacing components that have experienced innovation since the item was originally produced. We find that optimal reuse decreases with the rate of innovation, implying that models that ignore innovation overestimate the optimal amount of reuse that a company should pursue. Furthermore, we show that reuse can be encouraged in two waysthe intuitive approach of increasing end-of-life costs, and the less intuitive approach of raising the cost to make items reusable. We also examine the environmental impact of reuse, measured in terms of virgin material usage, finding that reuse can actually increase total virgin material usage in some cases. In an extension, we show how the results and insights change when the rate of innovation is uncertain.

Prior to market entry, the supplier performs process design activities, which improve manufacturing yield and the chances of getting qualified for the customer's product. However, a long delay in market entry allows competitors to enter the market and pass the customer's qualification process before the supplier, reducing the supplier's share of the customer's business. After entering the market and if qualified, the supplier also needs to decide how much to produce for a finite planning horizon by considering several factors such as manufacturing yield and stochastic demand, both of which depend on the earlier time-to-market decision. To capture this dependency, we develop a sequential, nested, two-stage decision framework to optimize the time-to-market and production decisions in relation to each other. We show that the supplier's optimal market entry and qualification timing decision need to be revised in real time based on the number of qualified competitors at the time of market-entry decision. We establish the optimality of a threshold policy. Following this policy, at the beginning of each decision epoch, the supplier should optimally stop preparing for qualification and decide whether to enter the market if her order among qualified competitors exceeds a predetermined threshold. We also prove that the supplier's optimal production policy is a state-dependent, base-stock policy, which depends on the time-to-market and qualification decisions. The proposed framework also enables a firm to quantify how market conditions (such as price and competitor entry behavior) and operating conditions (such as the rate of learning and inventory/production-related costs) affect time-to-market strategy and post-entry production decisions.

Whether strategic customers are willing to visit a website when they know their clicks may be tracked is an important yet complex problem, which depends on various factors. Using a newsvendor framework, we examine this problem by focusing on the operational factor: how product availability induces strategic customers to voluntarily provide advance demand information. We find that a strong Nash equilibrium exists where every customer is willing to click, and customer incentives to click are robust to noise. Hence, we demonstrate the promise of strategic customer behavior in the context of click tracking, contrary to the conventional wisdom that it is typically a peril for the firm. Notably, click tracking is typically advantageous to both the firm and its customers, compared with other strategies such as advance selling, quantity commitment, availability guarantees, and quick response. Lastly, we extend to two settings by including marketing decisions, price-sensitive demand and markdown pricing, and discuss how operations and marketing decisions interact in influencing the value of click tracking.

We focus on manufacturing enterprises, but many of our findings apply also to the back office of service operations. Our starting point is that, in nearly every industrial enterprise, there are many profitable EE projects that could be implemented but are not. An oft-cited hindrance to implementation is the lack of an internal management framework in which to find, value, and execute these projects. Using a conceptual approach, we rely on proven sustainable operations tools to develop such a framework. We identify three major value drivers of EE projects: savings intensity, green image, and project complexity. We then describe a framework for understanding the context of EE projects in industry, with an underlying analytic foundation in optimal portfolio analysis. A case study of a large manufacturing site is used to illustrate emerging best practicesbased on Kaizen management principlesfor integrating EE project management with operations, engineering, and strategy.

We designed a video experiment that varied the level of verbal scripting for standardized and customized service encounters. We found that in standardized service encounters, an increase in the level of verbal scripting had no effect on perceived service quality. However, for customized encounters, perceived service quality was impacted. More specifically, a predominantly scripted encounter for customized service processes, on average, resulted in the lowest perception of service quality by respondents. Since verbal scripting was shown to impact customer perceptions of service quality, we suggest that a service provider's decision regarding the degree of verbal scripting is an important service design consideration.

We provide a conceptual framework that describes a firm's network structure along three dimensions: market focus, plant focus, and network dispersion. Normalized dependent variables are specified that act as proxies for a company's placement into our conceptual network classification via the calculation of just a few key independent variables. We provide robust equation sets for eight cost structure clusters. Many different product types could be classified into one of these groups, which would allow managers to use the equations directly without needing to run the MIP for themselves. Our numerical tests suggest that the formulas representing the network structure driverseconomies of scale, complexity costs, transportation costs, and tariffsmay be sufficient for managers to design their strategic network structures, and perhaps more importantly, to monitor them over time to detect potential need for adjustment.

Both private customers and companies can rent temporary space from such facilities. The design of self-storage warehouses differs from other facility designs in its focus on revenue maximization. A major question is how to design self-storage facilities to fit market segments and accommodate volatile demand to maximize revenue. Customers that cannot be accommodated with a space size of their choice can be either rejected or upscaled to a larger space. Based on data of 54 warehouses in America, Europe, and Asia, we propose a new facility design approach with models for three different cases: an overflow customer rejection model and two models with customer upscale possibilities, one with reservation and another without reservation. We solve the models for several real warehouse cases, and our results show that the existing self-storage warehouses can be redesigned to generate larger revenues for all cases. Finally, we show that the upscaling policy without reservation generally outperforms the upscaling policy with reservation.

We show that in an upward market where the expected valuation increases over time, the optimal pricing policy is an ex ante static one where the seller prices into the future and prices the myopic consumers out of the advance market. However, in a downward market where the expected valuation decreases over time, the seller adopts a dynamic pricing strategy except for the case when higher initial sales can trigger more demand subsequently and when the downward trend is not too high. In this case, the seller prefers an ex ante static pricing strategy and deliberately prices lower initially to sell to speculators. We identify the conditions under which the seller benefits from the existence of speculators in the market. Moreover, although the presence of entry costs is ineffective as an entry deterrence, we determine the conditions under which exit costs can rein in speculative purchase.

Use of a common base platform and modular design approach allows a firm to offer updates for improved performance and flexibility via remanufacturing when products have multiple lifecycles. However, as the product evolves through multiple lifecycles, the large pool of product variants leads to the curse of product proliferation. In practice, product proliferation causes high levels of line congestion and results in longer lead times, higher inventory levels, and lower levels of customer service. To offer insights into the product proliferation problem, the authors employ a delayed differentiation model in a multiple lifecycle context. The delayed differentiation model gives flexibility to balance trade-offs between disassembly and reassembly costs by adaptively changing the push-pull boundary. An adaptive, evolving push-pull boundary provides flexibility for a remanufacturing firm to meet changing customer demands. The delayed differentiation model includes both a mixed-integer linear program and an analytical investigation of the evolutionary nature of the push-pull boundary. Both field observations and experimental results show that the nature of product proliferation and changing demand structures play significant roles in the cost and flexibility of the evolving delayed differentiation system.

While the demand structure creates opportunities through proliferation, the firm should avoid cannibalization between its own products. Moreover, the oligopolistic market structure puts competitive pressure and limits the firm's market share. On the other hand, the firm has limited resources that cause a supply-side fight for adequate and profitable production. We explicitly characterize the conditions where each force dominates. Our focus is on understanding how capacity constraints and competition affect a firm's product-mix decisions. We find that considering capacity constraints could significantly change traditional insights (that ignore capacity) related to product-line design and the role of competition therein. In particular, we show that when the resources are limited, the firm should offer only the product that has the highest margin per unit capacity. We find that this product could be the diametrically opposite product suggested by the existing literature. In addition, we show that for intermediate capacity levels, whereas the margin per unit capacity effect dominates in a less competitive market, proliferation and cannibalization effects dominate in a more competitive market.

Many retailers actively decide whether or not to encourage negotiation on the shop floor. Of course, the retailer's pricing policy influences not only the retailer's profit, but also the profits of the manufacturers who sell through the retailer. However, little is known about the forces that shape the pricing policy when two self-interested parties interact in a supply chain. We consider two alternative models depending on who has the power to decide the pricing policy: the manufacturer or the retailer. We find that an increase in the wholesale price weakens the retailer's ability to price discriminate through negotiation. Therefore, the retailer prefers negotiation at lower wholesale prices and posted pricing at higher wholesale prices. We also find that whenever the retailer prefers negotiation, the manufacturer does too. Therefore, the retailer's discretion over the pricing policy causes friction only when the retailer wants to use posted pricing, while the manufacturer wishes the retailer to use negotiation. We show that such friction arises only when product availability or the cost of negotiation is moderate. In this case, we show that the manufacturer may offer a substantial discount to persuade the retailer to negotiate. Surprisingly, in this region of friction, a decrease in the supply chain's capacity or an increase in negotiation costs (both of which are typically considered as worsening the retailer's business environment) translates into higher profit for the retailer.

In the make-to-order manufacturing context considered in this paper, sales plans cover both contract and spot sales, and procurement plans require the selection of supplier contracts. S&OP decisions also involve the allocation of capacity to support sales plans. This article studies the coordinated contract selection and capacity allocation problem, in a three-tier manufacturing supply chain, with the objective to maximize the manufacturer's profitability. Using a modeling approach based on stochastic programming with recourse, we show how these S&OP decisions can be made taking into account economic, market, supply, and system uncertainties. The research is based on a real business case in the Oriented Strand Board (OSB) industry. The computational results show that the proposed approach provides realistic and robust solutions. For the case considered, the planning method elaborated yields significant performance improvements over the solutions obtained from the mixed integer programming model previously suggested for S&OP.

We contrast the contracting outcome of a Stackelberg game, in which the manufacturers offer take-it-or-leave-it contracts to the retailers, with that of a bargaining game, in which the firms bilaterally negotiate contract terms via a process of alternating offers. The manufacturers in the Stackelberg game possess a Stackelberg-leader advantage in that the retailers are not entitled to make counteroffers. Our analysis suggests that whether this advantage would benefit the manufacturers depends on the contractual form. With simple contracts such as wholesale-price contracts, which generally do not allow one party to fully extract the trade surplus, the Stackelberg game replicates the boundary case of the bargaining game with the manufacturers possessing all the bargaining power. In contrast, with sophisticated contracts such as two-part tariffs, which enable full surplus extraction, the two games lead to distinct outcomes. We further show that the game structure being Stackelberg or bargaining critically affects firms' preferences over contract types and thus their equilibrium contract choices. These observations suggest that the Stackelberg game may not be a sufficient device to predict contracting behaviors in reality where bargaining is commonly observed.

Each firm serves a primary market, and the capacity agent sustains a common market to draw demand for capacity from the external firms. The firms can partner with the capacity agent under her contract to serve the common market. When they use the common market mainly as an outlet for their unused capacities, the capacity agent will only specify a variable fee for each capacity unit deployed through her, and prefer to partner with one firm in most circumstances. When the firms adjust capacities to accommodate the businesses created by serving the common market, the capacity agent will specify a lump-sum payment and a variable fee, and will be more likely to incentivize only one firm to partner with her, when the common market is sufficiently large or the demands in the common and primary markets are strongly correlated. She will always use a fixed fee to extract, while not necessarily all, the profit gains to the firms serving the common market, but will use a variable fee only when partnering with both firms. The key results are robust with respect to market configuration and contract type.

These approaches often lead to fragile solutions whenever the preselected family of distributions was inadequate. In this article, we propose a minimax robust model that integrates data fitting and inventory optimization for the single-item multi-period periodic review stochastic lot-sizing problem. In contrast with the standard assumption of given distributions, we assume that histograms are part of the input. The robust model generalizes the Bayesian model, and it can be interpreted as minimizing history-dependent risk measures. We prove that the optimal inventory control policies of the robust model share the same structure as the traditional stochastic dynamic programming counterpart. In particular, we analyze the robust model based on the chi-square goodness-of-fit test. If demand samples are obtained from a known distribution, the robust model converges to the stochastic model with true distribution under generous conditions. Its effectiveness is also validated by numerical experiments.

As a result, the scope of supply chain related operations have increasingly cut across organizational boundaries. To understand and capture such cross-organizational activities, researchers have broadened the focus of their studies and included multiple stakeholders in their analysis (e.g., integration, sustainability, and buyer-supplier relationships). However, multi-stakeholder research has also increased the complexity and effort required to conduct studies across organizational boundaries. Unfortunately, many studies that use multi-stakeholder constructs fail to fully address their multi-sided nature during both construct conceptualization and data collection. Several studies suggest that neglecting the multi-sided nature of certain constructs can affect the research validity and reliability and may invalidate research inferences and results, although such concerns have not been empirically demonstrated. The current study addresses this gap by performing a series of tests using data from 105 matched pairs of buyers and their suppliers to illustrate key methodological considerations for conducting multi-stakeholder research. This study also offers practical guidance regarding assumptions routinely made in single rater research and proposes when single rater data may be appropriate for multi-stakeholder research.

In this operation, order requests arrive continuously, and filled orders are shipped at a specific time each day. The metric links the continuous operation of order fulfillment to the scheduled shipment times. To prescribe goals against the metric, a performance model is developed that incorporates the motivational effect of a goal. Goal-Setting Theory is used to establish the performance goal and to show how to match arriving orders to deadlines based on their arrival times and expected processing times. Monte Carlo simulation on data from a large distribution center is used to demonstrate that setting these two parameters in the light of motivational research yields quite different results than doing so with an intuitive method. Moreover, a motivational goal leads to better operational performance; that is, correctly setting up the metric causes more customers to receive their orders sooner.

In many cities, local governments have introduced policy measures, in particular time-access restrictions, to alleviate these problems. However, setting time windows is very challenging due to the conflicting interests and objectives of the stakeholders involved. In this article, we examine whether it is possible to develop time-window policies that enhance environmental sustainability and distribution efficiencies, while meeting the objectives of the municipalities. We develop a framework for balancing retailer (costs), municipality (satisfaction), and environmental (emissions) objectives, using data envelopment analysis, under different urban time-window policies. The approach is illustrated by a case study of three Dutch retail organizations, with a large number of stores affected by such time windows. On the basis of an evaluation of 99 different time-window policies, our results show that harmonizing time windows between neighboring cities leads to the best overall performance. The currently used time-window policy appears to perform reasonably well, but can be improved on all dimensions. However, harmonizing time-window policies may be difficult to realize in practice.

Taking a supply chain perspective, logistics performance refers to cost, time, and complexity in accomplishing import and export activities. We draw on a data set compiled by the World Bank containing specific quantitative metrics of logistics performance in terms of time, cost, and variability in time. Numerous researchers have shown that logistics performance is statistically significantly related to the volume of bilateral trade. Our research calibrates the impact of specific improvements in logistics performance (time, cost, and reliability) on increased trade. Our findings can spur public and private agencies that have direct or indirect influence over logistics performance to focus attention on altering the most relevant aspects of logistics performance to improve their country's ability to compete in today's global economy. Moreover, as our logistics metrics are directly related to operational performance, countries can use these metrics to target actions to improve logistics and monitor their progress.

Suppliers under the threat of default have different objectives from profit-seeking companies. This paper analytically tests how profit-seeking or survival-seeking behavior, single-period or two-period consideration, and buyer's subsidy influence the supplier's and buyer's final utilities. The results show that under single-period consideration, the supplier's survival-seeking strategy in fact drives more start-ups or small suppliers out of business when the competition becomes severe; under two-period consideration, no matter which strategy (profit-seeking or survival-seeking) the supplier selects, the second-period price and profit are always higher than those of the first period. Furthermore, we find that providing subsidy is an effective way for buyer to keep suppliers' competition at a certain level on the behalf of buyer's interest. By numerically estimating the benefits associated with the cost of subsidy, we provide a basis for understanding the costbenefit analysis of buyer's subsidy strategy.

We use externally validated quality certification and quality awards as proxies for QMS and TQM, respectively, as it is difficult to directly measure the QMS and TQM efforts of firms. We use an unbalanced panel of 220 firms and a balanced panel of 73 firms from the Indian auto component industry over the period 19932006 to study these links. Both parametric as well as non-parametric approaches are used, as appropriate, to measure the rate of change in productivity and the impact of quality initiatives on productivity change during this period. We determine the proportion of productivity resulting from technical change and relative efficiency change, thus providing insights into the structure of productivity improvements. We find that TQM efforts resulted in a high rate of productivity change (11%) in the award-winning firms after the award. On the other hand, pre-certification productivity change due to QMS was 5% and post-certification change was 3.6%. In the periods prior to certification, productivity change was driven mainly by technical change; whereas the source of productivity change after certification is mixed. However, prior to awards, productivity change was driven mainly by relative efficiency change, whereas post-award productivity change was due to technical change. The results suggest that management focus on attaining certification did generate conceptual learning (linked to technical change) during the period leading to certification, but these effects were not significant after certification. The results also suggest that the TQM programs generated significant productivity gains in the long run, although setting the associated systems in place did not result in significant productivity change prior to winning awards. Thus, the study provides direct but nuanced evidence linking quality certification as well as the adoption of TQM programs to the associated conceptual and operational learning processes and their impact on the change in productivity.

In academia, there has been a growing interest in quantifying the impacts of such efforts on the corporate performance of Chinese firms, and research has been carried out in areas such as finance and accounting. However, due to limited visibility of operational decisions and data, there seems to be a lack of investigation into the impacts on the firms' operational performance in the literature. In this article, we apply an empirical method to investigate the inventories of 1286 firms listed on the two stock exchanges in China, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

Using data collected from 205 emerging market-based BPO service providers in India, we examine the antecedents and consequences of establishing governance control mechanisms in BPO service providers. Specifically, we examine how structural (use of contracts with the client), administrative (effective allocation and demarcation of responsibilities within the firm), and relational (collaboration and information sharing with the client) mechanisms drive the performance of a BPO service provider operating in an emerging market. We also examine how key task-related (task connectivity and task security) and client-related (end customer orientation and global control) antecedents influence the use of different governance control approaches in this environment. Our analysis finds that both task connectivity and task security significantly impact use of structural and administrative mechanisms, whereas end customer orientation is significantly associated with the strength of the relational mechanisms governing the emerging market-based BPO service provider and its client. Further global control significantly influences the strength of the structural mechanisms between the client and the BPO service provider. Finally, the three mechanisms have a complementary influence in driving the BPO service provider's performance.

A major challenge is for firms to manage costly inventories to address demand and supply risks in emerging markets. However, emerging market penetration may offer opportunities for firms to lower inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve operating performance. Using data for 482 manufacturing firms over the 5-year period, 20032007, obtained from the COMPUSTAT Industrial and Segment Databases, this article examines the relationships between emerging market penetration, inventory supply, and financial performance. Our results show that a multinational firm's sales penetration into emerging markets is associated with fewer days of inventory supply and improved financial performance. As emerging market penetration may allow firms to operate with lower inventory supply, the positive effect from emerging market penetration, such as labor cost reductions, may be enhanced due to inventory cost savings.

Limited (hereafter ITC) developed the e-Choupals for the rural areas of India. In this new business model, ITC reaches implicit agreements with some farmers (inside the network) that they can sell the products directly to ITC at the market price in the local market, but allow the farmers, both inside and outside the network, to access valuable information through the e-Choupals. In this study, we investigate ITC's incentive of offering such opportunities, especially to those farmers outside the network, and analyze the farmers' strategic quantity decisions. We show that the implicit agreement behaves as a formal contract, regardless of the price elasticity of the local market: Once reaching an agreement with ITC, the farmers always give priority to delivering directly to ITC. The e-Choupal network leads naturally to the complete separation of selling channels, provided that ITC's capacity constraint is not tight. Surprisingly, in a variety of scenarios, ITC finds it optimal to provide the best available training to the farmers outside the network. We further show that our results are not prone to potential cheating in the mandi system, the possible exploitation via postponed payments, and the stochastic effects on the market-clearing price.

Shortage of health care workers, severe financial constraints, and lack of awareness are some of the major obstacles that prevent higher access. However, ineffective and poorly designed supply chains for purchasing and distributing the medicines, vaccines, and health technologies are one of the most important barriers to increasing access. We argue that the ineffectiveness of the global health supply chain can be attributed largely to: coordination problems across multiple stakeholders with widely divergent objectives, lack of careful supply chain design, and use of myopic operational objectives and metrics. The operations management research community can contribute to improving this by applying existing knowledge to the field of global health delivery and by researching new frameworks of analysis which would then become the cornerstones for policy advice to those who design, operate, or finance these supply chains.

The interaction generally couples strongly the price decision of the supplier and the quantity decision of the buyer. We propose a basic model for a repeated supplierbuyer interaction, during several rounds. In each round, the supplier first quotes a price, and the buyer places an order at that price. We find conditions for existence and uniqueness of a well-behaved subgame-perfect equilibrium in the dynamic game. When costs are stationary and there are no holding costs, we identify some demand distributions for which these conditions are met, examine the efficiency of the equilibrium, and show that, as the number of rounds increases, the profits of the supply chain increase towards the supply chain optimum. In contrast, when costs vary over time or holding costs are present, the benefit from multi-period interactions is reduced and after a finite number of time periods, supply chain profits stay constant even when the number of rounds increases.

This harms supply chain performance. This study investigates the impact of information sharing in a principal-agent setting that is typical for many supply chain transactions. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test whether information sharing has an influence on supply chain coordination. We find that information sharing within the supply chain has two positive effects. First, information sharing reduces the inefficiencies resulting from information deficits if there is a certain amount of trust in the supply chain. Second, communication can limit out-of-equilibrium behavior with a small impact on the firm's own payoff, but a large impact on the supply chain partner. Furthermore, we find that both effects are amplified when communication takes place in an environment that allows the less informed supply chain party to punish or to reward the better informed party. Although our extended mechanisms substantially enhance the poor performance of the theoretically optimal coordination contract menu, we find no mechanism that implements supply chain performance superior to the theoretically predicted second-best level.

The supplier produces a single product and sells it to the retailers, who in turn sell the product to consumers. The supplier has limited production capacity, and the retailers are engaged in a Cournot competition at the consumer/market level. When the sum of the retailer orders exceeds the capacity, the supplier allocates her capacity according to a pre-announced allocation mechanism. Two mechanisms are considered: proportional allocation and lexicographic allocation. An extensive study of the two allocation mechanisms shows that the lexicographic mechanism has the ability to dampen the competition at the retail level, increasing the profits for both the supplier and the supply chain.

With two suppliers, the insightcost is the order qualifier while reliability is the order winnerderived in the literature for the case of exogenously determined price and independent suppliers, continues to hold when the suppliers' capacities are correlated. Moreover, a firm orders only from one supplier if the effective purchase cost from him, which includes the imputed cost of his unreliability, is lower than the wholesale price charged by his rival. Otherwise, the firm orders from both. Furthermore, the firm's diversification decision does not depend on the correlation between the two suppliers' random capacities. However, its order quantities do depend on the capacity correlation, and, if the firm's objective function is unimodal, the total order quantity decreases as the capacity correlation increases in the sense of the supermodular order. With more than two suppliers, the insight no longer holds. That is, when ordering from two or more suppliers, one is the lowest-cost supplier and the others are not selected on the basis of their costs. We conclude the paper by developing a solution algorithm for the firm's optimal diversification problem.

Our focus is on the contribution of flexibility in market good design to effective capacity allocation. The application studied is a capacity allocation problem involving several agents, each with a job, and a facility owner. Each agent generates revenue by purchasing capacity and scheduling its job at the facility. Ascending auctions with various market good designs are compared. We introduce a new market good that provides greater flexibility than those previously considered in the literature. We allow ask prices to depend both on agents' utility functions and on the number of bids at the previous round of the auction, in order to model and resolve resource conflicts. We develop both optimal and heuristic solution procedures for the winner determination problem. Our computational study shows that flexibility in market good design typically increases system value within auctions. A further increase is achieved if each agent is allowed to bid for multiple market goods at each round. On average, the multiple flexible market goods auction provides over 95% of the system value found by centralized planning.

While it can buffer against environmental threats to help ensure business continuity, slack can also be costly and reduce profitability. In this study we focus on operational slack, the form related to the firm's production processes. We investigate the role of operational slack on firm survival during its venture stage when its survival is significantly challenged by environmental threats. Specifically, we explore how change in three types of environmental uncertainty, namely dynamism, complexity, and lack of munificence, affect the relationship between operational slack and venture survival. Results suggest that with an increase in environmental uncertainty, operational slack lowers the likelihood of venture failure.

In procurement auctions, bidder quality may or may not be publicly known to all bidders, and the effect of this quality transparency on the auction outcome is one aspect of auction design that we examine. The second aspect of auction design that we examine is the effect of price visibility on the auction outcome, and the interaction between price visibility and quality transparency. In terms of price visibility, we consider two extreme cases: the sealed bid request for proposals (RFPs), and the open-bid dynamic auction event. In terms of bidder quality transparency, we also consider two extreme cases: a setting in which bidder qualities are publicly known and the case in which they are private. We find that in our laboratory experiments, the RFP format is consistent in generating higher buyer surplus levels than does the open-bid dynamic format. This advantage is independent of the quality transparency. In contrast, the open-bid format is highly sensitive to quality transparency, generating significantly lower buyer surplus levels when the information about bidder quality is public.

However, component commonality decisions that ignore remanufacturing can adversely affect the profitability of the firm. In this article we analyze how remanufacturing could reverse the OEM's commonality decision that is based on the manufacturing and sales of new products only. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which the OEM's optimal decision on commonality may be reversed and illustrate how her profit can be significantly higher if remanufacturing is taken into account ex ante. We illustrate the implementation of our model for two products in the Apple iPad (TM) family.

Successful engagement in after-sales service improves customer loyalty and allows for competitive differentiation through superior service like an extended service period during which customers are guaranteed to be provided with service parts. Inventory management during this period is challenging due to the substantial uncertainty concerning demand over a long time horizon. The traditional mechanism of spare parts acquisition is to place a large final order at the end of regular production of the parent product, causing major holding costs and a high level of obsolescence risk. With an increasing length of the service period, more flexibility is needed and can be provided by adding options like extra production and remanufacturing. However, coordinating all three options yields a complicated stochastic dynamic decision problem. For that problem type, we show that a quite simple decision rule with order-up-to levels for extra production and remanufacturing is very effective. We propose a heuristic procedure for parameter determination which accounts for the main stochastic and dynamic interactions in decision making, but still consists of relatively simple calculations that can be applied to practical problem sizes. A numerical study reveals that the heuristic performs extremely well under a wide range of conditions, and therefore can be strongly recommended as a decision support tool for the multi-option spare parts procurement problem. A comparison with decision rules adapted from practice demonstrates that our approach offers an opportunity for major cost reductions.

The resulting dynamic program for the firm is intractable and approximated by a deterministic linear program called the CDLP which has an exponential number of columns. However, under the choice-set paradigm when the segment consideration sets overlap, the CDLP is difficult to solve. Column generation has been proposed but finding an entering column has been shown to be NP-hard. In this study, starting with a concave program formulation called SDCP that is based on segment-level consideration sets, we add a class of constraints called product constraints (sigma PC), that project onto subsets of intersections. In addition, we propose a natural direct tightening of the SDCP called ESDC kappa, and compare the performance of both methods on the benchmark data sets in the literature. In our computational testing on the data sets, 2PC achieves the CDLP value at a fraction of the CPU time taken by column generation. For a large network our 2PC procedure runs under 70 seconds to come within 0.02% of the CDLP value, while column generation takes around 1 hour; for an even larger network with 68 legs, column generation does not converge even in 10 hours for most of the scenarios while 2PC runs under 9 minutes. Thus we believe our approach is very promising for quickly approximating CDLP when segment consideration sets overlap and the consideration sets themselves are relatively small.

We assume the presence of a continuum of infinitesimal firms where no individual firm has any discernable influence over the evolution of the overall market condition. Under this nonatomic-game approach, the unanimous adoption of an equilibrium pricing policy by all firms will yield a market-condition process that in turn will elicit the said policy as one of the best individual responses. For both deterministic- and stochastic-demand cases, we show the existence of equilibrium pricing policies that exhibit well-behaving monotone trends. Our computational study reveals many useful insights, including the fact that only a reasonable number of firms are needed for our approach to produce near-rational pricing policies.

The two parties can engage in one of three Cournot competition games: a simultaneous game, a sequential game with the OEM as the Stackelberg leader, and a sequential game with the CM as the Stackelberg leader. On the basis of these three basic games, this study investigates the two parties' Stackelberg leadership/followership decisions. When the outsourcing quantity and wholesale price are exogenously given, either party may prefer Stackelberg leadership or followership. For example, when the wholesale price or the proportion of production outsourced to the CM is lower than a threshold value, both parties prefer Stackelberg leadership and, consequently, play a simultaneous game in the consumer market. When the outsourcing quantity and wholesale price are decision variables, the competitive CM sets a wholesale price sufficiently low to allow both parties to coexist in the market, and the OEM outsources its entire production to this CM. This study also examines the impact of the supply chain parties' bargaining power on contract outcomes by considering a wholesale price that is determined via the generalized Nash bargaining scheme, finding a Stackelberg equilibrium to be sustained when the CM's degree of bargaining power is great and the non-competitive CM's wholesale price is high.

The research question we aim to address in this paper is: Does quality still pay in the new competitive environment? Using replication research, we re-examine the impact of an effective total quality management (TQM) program on a firm's operating performance in the new competitive environment. We use publicly available data for award-winning firms and adopt several control-firm-selection approaches in our event study. Based on data from more than 500 firms, we find that over a 10-year period-6 years before to 3 years after winning their first quality award firms in our sample perform significantly better than control groups in various operating performance measures. Not only do award-winning firms have better results after receiving awards, they also have superior performance records before the award. Our results suggest that quality is still critical to achieving long-term competitive advantages, and firms who continuously improve their quality continue to reap rewards by way of sales and financial performances exceeding those of their competitors.

With restoration capability, if disruption occurs, additional costly effort can be exerted to rebuild capacity, although its outcome is uncertain. We study how a firm (buyer) can use incentive mechanisms to motivate a supplier's investment in capacity restoration, and compare this approach with the traditional approach of diversifying part of the order to an expensive but reliable supplier. Under a Restoration Enhancement (RE) strategy, the buyer uses price and/or order quantity incentives to encourage the supplier's restoration investment decision. Two different cases are considered when the incentive is committed to ex ante (prior to disruption) and when it is committed to ex post (after disruption). In contrast, under a Supplier Diversification (SD) strategy, the buyer splits orders between a reliable supplier and an unreliable supplier to hedge against the disruption risk. Here, the buyer does not provide any separate incentive to the unreliable supplier. Our analysis indicates that under the RE strategy, where the buyer offers incentives, both the buyer and the supplier (weakly) prefer the ex ante commitment over the ex post one. Furthermore, the RE strategy is preferred over the SD strategy when the unreliable supplier's restoration outcome is more predictable or when a high restoration outcome is more likely. However, the buyer's preference for the SD strategy increases as market demand increases.

In practice, most manufacturers distribute a line of products with different features and qualities and not just a single product. Consider a manufacturer who distributes a product line through competing downstream retailers. In this setting, we investigate how and why the retailers' price and inventory decisions deviate from the centrally optimal decisions. Due to substitution between different product variants, as well as between different retailers, the incentive problems associated with distributing a product line are more complicated than that of distributing a single product. We characterize retailers' incentive distortions under a residual-claimancy contract, and construct contracts that achieve channel coordination. We show that retail price floors or inventory buybacks, appropriately tailored to each product variant, are among the contracts that can achieve coordination. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the optimal contract terms (such as wholesale prices and buyback prices) for each variant are influenced by the parameters of an underlying consumer choice model.

We analyze the performance of contingency responses to the realized yield information at the end of production and prior to its delivery to the destination market. The contingency responses considered are: (i) Emergency Production via which an emergency order is placed with another fast and perfectly reliable offshore supplier; (ii) Emergency Production and Delivery via which an expedited shipping of (partial or total) good units is used on top of Emergency Production. Within a periodic review inventory system with uncertain demand setting, we theoretically characterize the optimal decisions on the cycle order size, the emergency order size, and the way to split the available good units between the fast and slow shipping modes. We provide comparative statics on how the choices of these quantities are affected by each other and by the demand and yield uncertainties. We use numerical examples to illustrate the values of such contingency responses and the impact of other factors on the cost of meeting demand.

Its objective is to minimize the operational risks inherent in today's volatile environment of operations.

We derive the optimal adjusting mechanism analytically and extensively analyze the application boundary of the market-based adjustable outsourcing contract. We conclude by discussing implications for practice and research.

Using the Hotelling model, we find two retailers' optimal prices, given their host and guest space in two stores under the space-exchange strategy. Next, using the optimal space-dependent prices, we analyze a non-cooperative game, where each retailer makes a space allocation decision for the retailer's own store. We show that the two retailers will implement such a strategy in the game, if and only if their stores are large enough to serve more than one-half of their consumers. Nash equilibrium for the game exists, and its value depends on consumers' utilities and trip costs as well as the total available space in each retailer's store. Moreover, as a result of the space-exchange strategy, each retailer's prices in two stores are both higher than the retailer's price before the space exchange, but they may or may not be identical.

In this study we investigate the problem of designing a multi-item manufacturing system, where there is both demand- and production-related uncertainty, so that stockless operation will be optimal for all items. For the problem of interest, we focus on gaining an understanding of the effect of two design variables: (i) manufacturing speed measured by the average manufacturing rate or, equivalently, the average unit manufacturing time, and (ii) manufacturing consistency measured by the variation in unit manufacturing times. We establish conditions on these two variables that decision makers can use to design stockless production systems. Managerial implications of the conditions are also discussed.

We demonstrate that the model provides accurate approximations to various system performance measures, such as the response time distribution and the distribution of the number of busy ambulances, and that it can be used to identify near-optimal compliance tables. Our numerical results show that performance depends strongly on the compliance table that is used, indicating the importance of choosing a well-designed compliance table.
