J	Atasu, A; Cetinkaya, S				Atasu, Atalay; Cetinkaya, Sila			Lot sizing for optimal collection and use of remanufacturable returns over a finite life-cycle	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product returns; remanufacturing; inventory control; life cycle	REVERSE LOGISTICS; INVENTORY MODEL; PRODUCT; POLICY	Reverse supply chains process used product returns to recover value by re-processing them via remanufacturing operations. When remanufacturing is feasible, the longer the return flows are delayed during the active (primary) market demand period of the product, the lower the value that can be recovered through these operations. In fact, in order to recover the highest value from remanufactured products, the collection rates, return timings, and reusability rates should be matched with the active market demand and supply. With these motivations, this paper is aimed at developing analytical models for the efficient use of returns in making production, inventory, and remanufacturing decisions during the active market. More specifically, we consider a stylistic setting where a collector collects used product returns and ships them to the manufacturer who, in turn, recovers value by remanufacturing and supplies products during the active market demand. Naturally, the manufacturer's production, inventory and remanufacturing decisions and costs are influenced by the timing and quantity of the collector's shipments of used product returns. Hence, we investigate the impact of the timing of returns on the profitability of the manufacturer-collector pair by developing system-wide cost optimization models. Analyzing the properties of the optimal shipment frequency, we observe that the fastest reverse supply chain may not always be the most efficient one.

For this economic lot scheduling problem with returns (ELSPR), we consider policies with a common cycle time for all products, and with one manufacturing lot and one remanufacturing lot for each product during a cycle. For a given cycle time, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MIP) problem, which provides the basis for an exact solution. The application of this model for one of the core products of the case study company indicates a 16% reduction in cost compared to the current lot scheduling policy.

Joint life-cycle dynamics of new and remanufactured products	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; product diffusion; closed-loop supply chains	REPLACEMENT PURCHASES; CONSUMER DURABLES; DIFFUSION-MODELS	M any products considered for remanufacturing are durables that exhibit a well-pronounced product life cycle-they diffuse gradually through the market. The remanufactured product, which is a cheaper substitute for the new product, is often put on the market during the life cycle of the new product and affects its sales dynamics. In this paper, we study the integrated dynamic management of a portfolio of new and remanufactured products that progressively penetrate a potential market over the product life cycle. To this end, we extend the Bass diffusion model in a way that maintains the two essential features of remanufacturing settings: (a) substitution between new and remanufactured products, and (b) a constraint on the diffusion of remanufactured products due to the limited supply of used products that can be remanufactured. We identify characteristics of the diffusion paths of new and remanufactured products. Finally, we analyze the impact of levers such as remanufacturability level, capacity profile and reverse channel speed on profitability.

J	Georgiadis, P; Vlachos, D; Tagaras, G				Georgiadis, Patroklos; Vlachos, Dimitrios; Tagaras, George			The impact of product lifecycle on capacity planning of closed-loop supply chains with remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						closed-loop supply chains; remanufacturing; capacity planning; system dynamics; lifecycle	REVERSE LOGISTICS; MANAGEMENT; RECOVERY; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Product recovery operations in reverse supply chains face rapidly changing demand due to the increasing number of product offerings with reduced lifecycles. Therefore, capacity planning becomes a strategic issue of major importance for the profitability of closed-loop supply chains. This work studies a closed-loop supply chain with remanufacturing and presents dynamic capacity planning policies developed through the methodology of System Dynamics. The key issue of the paper is how the lifecycles and return patterns of various products affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The model can be used to identify effective policies, to conduct various "what-if" analyses, and to answer questions about the long-term profitability of reverse supply chains with remanufacturing. The results of numerical examples with quite different lifecycle and return patterns show how the optimal collection expansion/contraction and remanufacturing contraction policies depend on the lifecycle type and the average usage time of the product, while the remanufacturing capacity expansion policy is not significantly affected by these factors. The results also show that the collection and remanufacturing capacity policies are insensitive to the total product demand. The insensitivity of the optimal policies to total demand is a particularly appealing feature of the proposed model, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate demand forecasts.

This can be a challenge due to the inherent variability in the condition and amount of returns, which has a direct impact on remanufacturing costs and leadtimes. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to compare two alternative strategies that use either manufacturing or remanufacturing as the primary means of satisfying customer demand. Of course, in the event that the demand cannot be met by the prioritized process, the secondary process is used as a contingency. In our basic model, the priority decisions are made at the component level in replenishing the serviceable inventory, while the disposal and new component ordering decisions are made independently. The second model represents the coordination of remanufacturable and new component inventory control decisions. Using simulation-based optimization on a large number of experiments, we observe that when prioritization is in the upstream echelon and there is no coordination in managing component stocks, there exists a critical return ratio, below which it is beneficial to give priority to manufacturing and above which it is beneficial to give priority to remanufacturing. We also see that coordinated control of the component inventories considerably reduces the importance of prioritization. These observations remain valid when congestion in the shop floor is also taken into account. We also study the benefits of state-dependent dispatching policies in a realistic case.

Closed-loop supply chains: An introduction to the feature issue (part 1)	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						closed-loop supply chains; sustainable operations	PRODUCT RETURNS	Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) have product returns at the center of attention. Our view is that CLSC are best managed from a business perspective where organizations seek to maximize value recovery. The research in the feature issue, and our experiences, shows that there are still numerous, unresolved, managerially relevant issues that deserve further investigation. We also observe that there is a pressing need to validate the assumptions in our models using interdisciplinary, industry-driven research. The time is right for production and operations management to play a central role in the sustainability movement slowly taking hold in practice.

Beril			The effect of competition on recovery strategies	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; competition; pricing; entry-deterrent strategies	REMANUFACTURABLE PRODUCTS; SEGMENTATION; QUALITY; BACK	Manufacturers often face a choice of whether to recover the value in their end-of-life products through remanufacturing. In many cases, firms choose not to remanufacture, as they are (rightly) concerned that the remanufactured product will cannibalize sales of the higher-margin new product. However, such a strategy may backfire for manufacturers operating in industries where their end-of-life products (cell phones, tires, computers, automotive parts, etc.) are attractive to third-party remanufacturers, who may seriously cannibalize sales of the original manufacturer. In this paper, we develop models to support a manufacturer's recovery strategy in the face of a competitive threat on the remanufactured product market. We first analyze the competition between new and remanufactured products produced by a monopolist manufacturer and identify conditions under which the firm would choose not to remanufacture its products. We then characterize the potential profit loss due to external remanufacturing competition and analyze two entry-deterrent strategies: remanufacturing and preemptive collection. We find that a firm may choose to remanufacture or preemptively collect its used products to deter entry, even when the firm would not have chosen to do so under a pure monopoly environment. Finally, we discuss conditions under which each strategy is more beneficial.

Optimal price and quantity of refurbished products	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						reverse logistics; refurbishment; queueing networks; optimization	REMANUFACTURABLE PRODUCTS; TECHNOLOGY	Many retail product returns can be refurbished and resold, typically at a reduced price. The price set for the refurbished products affects the demands for both new and refurbished products, while the refurbishment and resale activities incur costs. To maximize profit, a manufacturer in a competitive market must carefully choose the proportion of returned products to refurbish and their sale price. We model the sale, return, refurbishment, and resale processes in an open queueing network and formulate a mathematical program to find the optimal price and proportion to refurbish. Examination of the optimality conditions reveals the different situations in which it is optimal to refurbish none, some, or all of the returned products. Refurbishing operations may increase profit or may be required to relieve a manufacturing capacity bottleneck. A numerical study identifies characteristics of the new product market and refurbished products that encourage refurbishing and some situations in which small changes in the refurbishing cost and quality provoke large changes in the optimal policy.

Optimal acquisition and sorting policies for remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; product acquisition management; used product sorting	LOOP SUPPLY CHAINS; PRODUCT RECOVERY; REVERSE-LOGISTICS; INDUSTRY PRACTICE; MANAGEMENT; RETURNS; COMPETITION; OPERATIONS; MODELS	The condition of the used items acquired by remanufacturers is often highly variable, and sorting is an important aspect of remanufacturing operations. Sorting policies-the rules specifying which used products should be remanufactured and which should be scrapped-have received limited attention in the literature. In this paper, we examine the case of a remanufacturer who acquires unsorted used products as needed from third party brokers. As more used items are acquired for a given demand, the remanufacturer can be more selective when sorting. Thus, two related decisions are made: how many used items to acquire, and how selective to be during the sorting process. We derive optimal acquisition and sorting policies in the presence of used product condition variability for a remanufacturer facing both deterministic and uncertain demand. We show the existence of a single optimal acquisition and sorting policy with a simple structure and show that this policy is independent of production amount when acquisition costs are linear.

Value of information in closed loop supply chains	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						value of information; inventory control; supply chain management	INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTS	We explore the value of information (VOI) in the context of a firm that faces uncertainty with respect to demand, product return, and product recovery (yield). The operational decision of interest in matching supply with demand is the quantity of new product to order. Our objective is to evaluate the VOI from reducing one or more types of uncertainties, where value is measured by the reduction in total expected holding and shortage costs. We start with a single period model with normally distributed demands and returns, and restrict the analysis to the value of full information (VOFI) on one or more types of uncertainty. We develop estimators that are predictive of the value and sensitivity of (combinations of) different information types. We find that there is no dominance in value amongst the different types of information, and that there is an additional pay-off from investing in more than one type. We then extend our analysis to the multi-period case, where returns in a period are correlated with demands in the previous period, and study the value of partial information (VOPI) as well as full information. We demonstrate that our results from the single period model (adapted for VOPI) carry-over exactly. Furthermore, a comparison with uniformly distributed demand and return show that these results are robust with respect to distributional assumptions.

Motivated by the automotive parts remanufacturing industry, we consider an end-of-life product from which a particular part can be recovered and remanufactured for reuse, and the remainder of the product can be recycled for material recovery. Both the supply of end-of-life products and demand for remanufactured parts are price-sensitive. Yield of the recovery process is random and depends on the acquisition price offered for the end-of-life products. In this setting, we develop models to determine the optimal acquisition price for the end-of-life products and the selling price for remanufactured parts. We also analyze the effects of yield variation to the profitability of remanufacturing, benefits of delaying pricing decisions until after yield realization, and value of perfect yield rate information.

Optimal order quantities with remanufacturing across new product generations	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MARKET-SEGMENTATION; INVENTORY PROBLEM; RECOVERY; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; MODELS	We address the problem of determining the optimal retailer order quantities from a manufacturer who makes new products in conjunction with ordering remanufactured products from a remanufacturer using used and unsold products from the previous product generation. Specifically, we determine the optimal order quantity by the retailer for four systems of decision-making: (a) the three firms make their decisions in a coordinated fashion, (b) the retailer acts independently while the manufacturer and remanufacturer coordinate their decisions, (c) the remanufacturer acts independently while the retailer and manufacturer coordinate their decisions, and (d) all three firms act independently. We model the four options described above as centralized or decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and provide insights into the optimal order quantities. Coordination mechanisms are then provided which enable the different players to achieve jointly the equivalent profits in a coordinated channel.

We also assess the diversity of articles in terms of the purposes of research, data collection approaches, and data analysis techniques. We classify the empirical research articles based on their primary purpose (theory building, theory verifying, application, and providing evidence), data collection approach (case study, qualitative research, archival research, survey-based research, laboratory research, and field research), data analysis technique (descriptive statistics, various multivariate statistical techniques, and mathematical modeling), and operations topics (strategy, quality, and supply chain management). We also discuss directions for future empirical research in operations management. During 1992 to 2005, the articles based on empirical data have increased substantially from 30 to 50 percent of all articles published in POM. During 1992 to 1998, about three-fourths of the empirical-research-based articles published in POM focused on the manufacturing industry, but recently the gap between the numbers of manufacturing- and service-focused articles published in POM has almost disappeared. While a previous assessment of articles published in a range of operations management journals showed that almost all of the empirical articles were based on either surveys or case studies, our results indicate that POM has published articles that were based on a much wider and more diverse range of data collection approaches. Production and Operations Management has clearly established itself as a leading outlet for publishing empirical research in operations management.

The manuscripts covered dealt with topics including supply chain design, uncertainty and the bullwhip effect, contracts and supply chain coordination, capacity and sourcing decisions, applications and practice, and teaching supply chain management. In the process of this review, we highlight the significant contribution of POM to the field of supply chain management, and illustrate how this body of work has served to further the mission of the journal. We then highlight works from this group along with the discussion of selected papers from other top journals in an effort to provide a reasonably complete overview of important issues addressed in recent supply chain management research. Using our research survey and conceptual overview of the area as a foundation, we offer comments which highlight opportunities and suggest ideas on how to usefully expand the body of work in the supply chain management area.

J	Boyaci, T; Ray, S				Boyaci, Tamer; Ray, Saibal			The impact of capacity costs on product differentiation in delivery time, delivery reliability, and price	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product differentiation; capacity management; time-based customer service; delivery time guarantee; pricing	DEMAND	W e develop an analytical framework for studying the role capacity costs play in shaping the optimal differentiation strategy in terms of prices, delivery times, and delivery reliabilities of a profit-maximizing firm selling two variants (express and regular) of a product in a capacitated environment. We first investigate three special cases. The first is an existing model of price and delivery time differentiation with exogenous reliabilities, which we only review. The second focuses on time-based (i.e., length and reliability) differentiation with exogenous prices. The third deals with deciding on all features for an express variant when a regular product already exists in the marketplace. We subsequently address the integrative framework of time-and-price-based differentiation for both products in a numerical study. Our results shed light on the role that customer preferences towards delivery times, reliabilities and prices, and the capacity costs (absolute and relative) have on the firm's optimal product positioning policy.

J	Biller, S; Muriel, A; Zhang, YM				Biller, Stephan; Muriel, Ana; Zhang, Yongmei			Impact of price postponement on capacity and flexibility investment decisions	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						dedicated and flexible capacity investments; pricing; stochastic programming	COORDINATING INVENTORY CONTROL; FIXED ORDERING COST; MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; FLEXIBLE RESOURCES; RANDOM DEMAND; STRATEGIES; SYSTEMS	Investments in dedicated and flexible capacity have traditionally been based on demand forecasts obtained under the assumption of a predetermined product price. However, the impact on revenue of poor capacity and flexibility decisions can be mitigated by appropriately changing prices. While investment decisions need to be made years before demand is realized, pricing decisions can easily be postponed until product launch, when more accurate demand information is available. We study the effect of this price decision delay on the optimal investments on dedicated and flexible capacity. Computational experiments show that considering price postponement at the planning stage leads to a large reduction in capacity investments, especially in the more expensive flexible capacity, and a significant increase in profits. Its impact depends on demand correlation, elasticity and diversion, ratio of fixed to variable capacity costs, and uncertainty remaining at the times the pricing and production decisions are made.

In this paper, I build both theoretical and empirical understanding of task-environmental contingencies that may either enable or constrain the selection of various flexibility strategies. The special emphasis is on the various plant-level actions that are used to seek manufacturing flexibility. Demand uncertainty and variability, technology, and competitive strategy emerge as the most important contingencies, although not in ways that are immediately apparent. Finally, managerial implications at both the corporate as well as manufacturing unit levels are discussed.

This study controlled for industry by investigating the online home delivery grocery business, and an analysis of 1,919 customers of home delivery grocers identified four groups of online customers based on reasons for selecting this service. These four groups were next linked to operational execution in terms of service, product, and Internet quality, and found to vary in predicable ways. Subsequent to the initial data collection, five month's of post hoc longitudinal purchasing history was collected on the four groups of online customers to determine the relative profitability. Finally, as a follow-on analysis, the study used regression to predict future consumer purchases based upon operational execution. Time savings and service quality emerged as the two most important independent variables in terms of future buying from such online home delivery services.

Neil; Hall, Nicholas G.; Sriskandarajah, Chelliah			Supply chain scheduling: Distribution systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain scheduling; distribution system; cooperation in decision making; algorithms	COORDINATION; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; MACHINE	We study conflict and cooperation issues arising in a supply chain where a manufacturer makes products which are shipped to customers by a distributor. The manufacturer and the distributor each has an ideal schedule, determined by cost and capacity considerations. However, these two schedules are in general not well coordinated, which leads to poor overall performance. In this context, we study two practical problems. In both problems, the manufacturer focuses on minimizing unproductive time. The distributor minimizes customer cost measures in the first problem and minimizes inventory holding cost in the second problem. We first evaluate each party's conflict, which is the relative increase in cost that results from using the other party's optimal schedule. Since this conflict is often significant, we consider several practical scenarios about the level of cooperation between the manufacturer and the distributor. These scenarios define various scheduling problems for the manufacturer, the distributor, and the overall system. For each of these scheduling problems, we provide an algorithm. We demonstrate that the cost saving provided by cooperation between the decision makers is usually significant.

Each stage holds no finished goods inventory, but rather only backlogs that can be managed by adjusting staffing levels. We develop optimal control policies to balance backlog costs against hiring and firing personnel costs-assuming shared backlog information-under both centralized and decentralized control. We examine when there is sufficient economic incentive for two completely decentralized stages to begin: (1) to share backlog information without centralizing control, or (2) to completely centralize control. These switching points are determined by the relative service and personnel costs of the two stages. From these results, we show that decentralizing control in many cases does not materially worsen performance, so long as information is shared. Moreover, in some cases, even sharing information is of only marginal benefit.

Inventory models with continuous and Poisson demands and discounted and average costs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						(s, S) policy; stochastic inventory model; EOQ model; compound Poisson process; average discounted-cost formula	LEAD TIMES; SIMPLE PROOF; S POLICIES; SYSTEMS; OPTIMALITY; ENVIRONMENT	We develop a new, unified approach to treating continuous-time stochastic inventory problems with both the average and discounted cost criteria. The approach involves the development of an adjusted discounted cycle cost formula, which has an appealing intuitive interpretation. We show for the first time that an (s, S) policy is optimal in the case of demand having a compound Poisson component as well as a constant rate component. Our demand structure simultaneously generalizes the classical EOQ model and the inventory models with Poisson demand, and we indicate the reasons why this task has been a difficult one. We do not require the surplus cost function to be convex or quasi-convex as has been assumed in the literature. Finally, we show that the optimal s is unique, but we do not know if optimal S is unique.

All installations use continuous review installation-stock (R, Q) policies. The analysis builds on an approximation model where the stochastic warehouse delays are replaced by their correct averages. The contributions include insights as to how beta* is influenced by system parameters, and the determination of simple closed form beta* estimates. The latter offering a practical means to achieve coordinated control of large size systems.

By contrast, cells with a dual gripper robot, although more productive, have so far received scant attention, perhaps due to their inherent complexity. We consider the problem of scheduling operations in dual gripper robotic cells that produce identical parts. The objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-rain average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. We provide a structural analysis of cells with one or more machines per processing stage to obtain first a lower bound on the throughput and, subsequently, an optimal solution under conditions that are common in practice. We illustrate our analysis on two, cells implemented at a semiconductor equipment manufacturer and offer managerial insights for assessing the potential productivity gains from the use of dual gripper robots.

Foundations and implications of a proposed Unified Services Theory	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						services management theory; service operations; business process models	CUSTOMER CONTACT MODEL; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; SUPPLY CHAINS; QUALITY; PERCEPTIONS; BUSINESSES; EXPERIENCE; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; INSIGHTS	Diverse businesses, such as garbage collection, retail banking, and management consulting are often tied together under the heading of "services", based on little more than a perception that then are intangible and do not manufacture anything. Such definitions inadequately identify managerial and operational implications common among, and unique to, services. We present a "Unified Services Theory" (UST) to clearly delineate service processes from non-service processes and to identify key commonalities across seemingly disparate service businesses. The UST defines a service production process as one that relies on customer inputs; customers act as suppliers for all service processes. Non-services (such as make-to-stock manufacturing) rely on customer selection of outputs, payment for outputs, and occasional feedback, but production is not dependent upon inputs from individual customers. The UST reveals principles that are common to the wide range of services and provides a unifying foundation for various theories and models of service operations, such as the traditional "characteristics of services" and Customer Contact Theory. The UST has significant operational corollaries pertaining to capacity and demand management, service quality, services strategy, and so forth. The UST provides a common reference point to which services management researchers can anchor future theory-building and theory-testing research.

J	Ferdows, K				Ferdows, K			Transfer of changing production know-how	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						transfer of production know-how; knowledge management; absorptive capacity; production networks; codified versus tacit knowledge	KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; MANAGING KNOWLEDGE; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT; STICKINESS; IMPACT; FIRM	Even with the rich literature on knowledge management, we still don't know enough about how the rate of change in production-know-how affects the choice of mechanisms for its transfer. Codifying tacit know-how helps, but codification becomes more challenging as the know-how changes more frequently. Transfer of tacit know-how becomes much more complicated when it changes often. We need more research in this area, particularly to help production and operations managers who must ultimately use the new know-how and change their companies' production processes. The paper suggests a framework as a step in that direction. The framework focuses on the interplay between the level of codification and the rate of change of production know-how, and identifies four zones for classifying production know-how: "slow and codified," "slow and tacit," "fast and codified," and "fast and tacit." Examples from McDonald's, Club Med, Intel, and AOL are used to illustrate primary transfer mechanisms for each zone (manuals and systems, people, joint-development, and projects, respectively). Appropriate absorptive capacities in the production units for each zone are also identified. Since the ultimate responsibility of operations managers is to improve (i.e., change) their production know-how as fast as possible, they would be wise to adopt policies that are closer to those suited for the "fast and codified" zone. Intel and Toyota show good models.

J	Squire, B; Brown, S; Readman, J; Bessant, J				Squire, B; Brown, S; Readman, J; Bessant, J			The impact of mass customisation on manufacturing trade-offs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						trade-offs; manufacturing strategy; empirical research	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; CUSTOMER; MODEL; LINK	Management literature has suggested that the advent of mass customisation marks the end for trade-offs between customisation and other competitive priorities (Pine et al. 1993; Westbrook and Williamson 1993; Tu et al. 2001). However, evidence supporting this proposition is anecdotal. This paper examines the impact of product customisation on four competitive priorities, drawing upon the results of a recent survey of 102 U.K. manufacturing firms from eight industry sectors. The study indicates significant compatibility between customisation and quality, volume flexibility, delivery reliability and non-manufacturing costs. On the other hand, trade-offs remain between customisation and manufacturing costs and delivery lead times. The results contradict the initial proposition that customisation can be "free," and have important implications for firms embarking upon a mass customisation strategy.

We analyze the effect of contract leadership (i.e., the ability to offer wholesale price and two-part tariff contracts) on supply chain performance and use that as a basis to study coordination and cooperation. There is strong evidence of first-mover advantage in wholesale price contracting which is amplified when the chain is coordinated using two-part tariff contracts. We analyze cooperation and the implications of leader location in uncoordinated chains. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the entire sequence of successive contracts when assessing the performance of a supply chain. We find that in some cases an inefficient supply chain may have a natural tendency to reduce inefficiency through cooperation between non-leader members.

We first consider that in order to mitigate channel conflict the manufacturer, who chooses wholesale prices as a Stackelberg leader, commits to setting a direct channel retail price that matches the retailer's price in the traditional channel. We find that the specific equal-pricing strategy that optimizes profits for the manufacturer is also preferred by the retailer and customers over other equal-pricing strategies. We next consider the implications of the equal-pricing constraint through a numerical experiment that indicates that the equal-pricing strategy is appropriate as long as the Internet channel is significantly less convenient than the traditional channel. If the Internet channel is of comparable convenience to the traditional channel, then the manufacturer has tremendous incentive to abandon the equal-pricing policy, at great peril to the traditional retailer.

We assume a periodic review model with stochastic demand, lost sales, and order quantity restrictions. The product lifetime is fixed and deterministic once received by the retailer, although the age of replenished items provided by the supplier varies stochastically over time. Since the product is perishable, any unsold inventory remaining after the lifetime elapses must be discarded (outdated). Without the supplier explicitly informing the retailer of the product age, the age remains unknown until receipt. With information sharing, the retailer is informed of the product age prior to placing an order and hence, can utilize this information in its decision-making. We formulate the retailer's replenishment policies, with and without knowing the age of the product upon receipt, and measure the VOI as the marginal improvement in profit that the retailer achieves with information sharing, relative to the case when no information is shared. We establish the importance of information sharing and identify the conditions under which substantial benefits can be realized.

J	Cotteleer, MJ				Cotteleer, MJ			An empirical study of operational performance parity following enterprise system deployment	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						enterprise systems; information technology performance; parity; synchronization; empirical research	PRODUCTIVITY PARADOX; SUPPLY CHAINS; E-COMMERCE; MANAGEMENT; ERP; COORDINATION	This paper presents an empirical investigation into whether the implementation of packaged Enterprise Systems (ES) leads to parity in operational performance. Performance change and parity in operational performance are investigated in three geographically defined operating regions of a single firm. Order lead time, the elapsed time between receipt of an order and shipment to a customer, is used as a measure of operational performance. A single ES installation was deployed across all regions of the subject firm's operations. Findings illustrate parity as an immediate consequence of ES deployment. However, differences in rates of performance improvement following deployment eventually result in significant (albeit smaller than pre-deployment) performance differences. An additional consequence of deployment seems to be an increased synchronization of performance across the formerly independent regions.

The arrival rate and the proportion of servers present are treated as random variables. The basic model is a multi-server queue with customer abandonment, allowing non-exponential service-time and time-to-abandon distributions. The goal is to maximize the expected net return, given throughput benefit and server, customer-abandonment and customer-waiting costs, but attention is also given to the standard deviation of the return. The approach is to approximate the performance and the net return, conditional on the random model-parameter vector, and then uncondition to get the desired results. Two recently-developed approximations are used for the conditional performance measures: first, a deterministic fluid approximation and, second, a numerical algorithm based on a purely Markovian birth-and-death model, having state-dependent death rates.

J	Chambers, C; Kouvelis, P				Chambers, C; Kouvelis, P			Modeling and managing the percentage of satisfied customers in hidden and revealed waiting line systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						waiting lines; customer satisfaction; management of customer queues	SERVICE	We perform an analysis of various queueing systems with an emphasis on estimating a single performance metric. This metric is defined to be the percentage of customers whose actual waiting time was less than their individual waiting time threshold. We label this metric the Percentage of Satisfied Customers (PSC.) This threshold is a reflection of the customers' expectation of a reasonable waiting time in the system given its current state. Cases in which no system state information is available to the customer are referred to as "hidden queues." For such systems, the waiting time threshold is independent of the length of the waiting line, and it is randomly drawn from a distribution of threshold values for the customer population. The literature generally assumes that such thresholds are exponentially distributed. For these cases, we derive closed form expressions for our performance metric for a variety of possible service time distributions. We also relax this assumption for cases where service times are exponential and derive closed form results for a large class of threshold distributions. We analyze such queues for both single and multi-server systems. We refer to cases in which customers may observe the length of the line as "revealed" queues." We perform a parallel analysis for both single and multi-server revealed queues. The chief distinction is that for these cases, customers may develop threshold values that are dependent upon the number of customers in the system upon their arrival. The new perspective this paper brings to the modeling of the performance of waiting line systems allows us to rethink and suggest ways to enhance the effectiveness of various managerial options for improving the service quality and customer satisfaction of waiting line systems. We conclude with many useful insights on ways to improve customer satisfaction in waiting line situations that follow directly from our analysis.

J	Hays, JM; Hill, AV				Hays, JM; Hill, AV			An extended longitudinal study of the effects of a service guarantee	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						service recovery; complaint management; customer satisfaction; service guarantees; empirical research	CUSTOMER COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT; LIKELIHOOD FACTOR-ANALYSIS; TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; RECOVERY; ORGANIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; IMPACT; POWER	This paper examines the long-term effects of a service guarantee on employee motivation, learning through service failure, and customer intention to return. Service guarantees have been hypothesized to positively affect customer perception of service quality (and/or customer intention to return) through their positive effect on both learning through service failure and employee motivation. However, there has been no long-term study of these effects. A longitudinal, empirical study was conducted to investigate the question of whether a service guarantee program is a short-term fix or a long-term solution. The service guarantee was found to have a positive, long-term effect on both employee motivation and customer intention to return. However, the service guarantee did not have a significant direct effect on employee perceptions of improvement through learning from service failure. This research highlights the need for organizations to make better use of the information and knowledge gained from invocations of a service guarantee and strongly supports using a service guarantee to improve customer loyalty and increase employee motivation.

Our problem has a number of general features such as demand fluctuation, operating and maintenance costs that depend on the amount of capacity utilized, capacity disposal, and capacity shortage. Formulated as a mixed integer programming model, we are able to exploit special structures inherent in the problem to develop primal-based and dual-based heuristic solution methods. We discuss the merits of our solution approach based on results obtained by solving a wide array of reasonably sized randomly generated problems.

J	Treleven, MD; Watts, CA; Penlesky, RJ				Treleven, MD; Watts, CA; Penlesky, RJ			Processing time estimation errors' impact on dispatching performance	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						job shop; dispatching; due dates; processing time estimation; simulation	RESOURCE CONSTRAINED SYSTEM; DYNAMIC JOB-SHOP; LOAD	This paper examines the impact of inaccuracies in the estimation of processing times on the performance of dispatching rules in dual-resource-constrained and machine-limited job shops. Four distributions of estimation errors are examined in eight different simulated shop environments representing DRC and ML job shops with different labor utilization levels and dispatching rules. A unique approach to setting total-work-content-based due dates is introduced and recommended as more appropriate than the approaches previously used. The mean and standard deviation of the absolute value of lateness are reported as performance measures. The results indicate that errors in the estimation of processing times have a significant impact on shop performance. Specifically, optimistic and high variance estimated processing time distributions produce significantly worse shop performance than accurate and pessimistic errors. The interactions between the effects of the estimated processing time distribution and due date tightness are also shown to be significant.

J	Yeung, ACL; Cheng, TCE; Lai, KH				Yeung, ACL; Cheng, TCE; Lai, KH			An operational and institutional perspective on total quality management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Total Quality Management; institutional perspective; organizational performance; empirical research	MANAGING QUALITY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; CORPORATE PERFORMANCE; ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY; EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; IMPLEMENTATION; TQM; ORGANIZATION; MODEL; EQUIFINALITY	Although Total Quality Management (TQM) is widely touted as a management paradigm that will enable firms to gain a competitive advantage, many practitioners report that TQM programs fail to live up to their expectations. There is an on-going debate over the effectiveness of TQM in the literature. This study investigates a number of controversial benefits of TQM. We seek to determine if TQM is generally beneficial to the firms that adopt it, and if these firms gain operational efficiency over time and secure institutional values. We also attempt to discern if advanced TQM adopters lead to different management paradigms, as proponents of TQM claim, or if both TQM and non-TQM firms can be equally successful. Based on a study of 225 TQM and non-TQM electronics manufacturing firms in Hong Kong, we find that the adoption of TQM correlates with significant advances in performance measures. However, unlike other organizational innovations, the implementation of TQM in industry does not follow a social perspective in institutional theory that there seems to be no legitimacy effect. A comparison of advanced TQM firms and leading non-TQM firms reveals that they do not differ in their organizational performances. No distinctive TQM paradigms are found, implying equifinality in quality management.

This note argues that it can be proved from the fundamental assumptions of the model and that this result does not require an infinite time horizon. We provide two proofs. The general proof is couched in a mathematical programming formulation. The second is by contradiction and suitable for classroom use.
