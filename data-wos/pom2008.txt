PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Annual Conference of the Production-and-Operations-Management-Society	2006	Boston, MA	Product Operat Management Soc		POM; rejuvenation; reunification; networks; research		I am concerned that the field of production and operations management is losing direction and cohesion, as well as the battle for the best new faculty, student enrollments, and research funding. This problem is not due to a lack of interesting initiatives but because our several active subfields are pulling LIS in different directions and causing our common ground to shrink. This is at a time when firms around the globe are facing perplexing operating problems that are apparently not resolvable through existing theories and techniques. Other academic fields have experienced similar strains at certain points, and they tend to get to that point following a progression like those that production and operations management has witnessed three times in the past 50 years. After briefly describing these past histories, I propose that we are near the end of one cycle and need a new jolt of energy to begin another. The problems of coordinating the complex collaborations among networked organizations (the Coordination of Operations across Multiple Organizations) are becoming increasingly important in today's economy I suggest that intensive multiteam studies of such networks could provide new insights into these pressing problems, stimulate creativity, and help reunify our field.

J	Lee, SY; Klassen, RD				Lee, Su-Yol; Klassen, Robert D.			Drivers and Enablers That Foster Environmental Management Capabilities in Small- and Medium-Sized Suppliers in Supply Chains	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						green supply chain management; environmental issues; SME suppliers; newly industrialized and developing countries	GREEN; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS	The limited capabilities and resources available within many small- and medium-sized enterprises frequently hamper an effective response to environmental pressures, which in turn hurts large buying firms (i.e., customers). Using a case study method with multiple suppliers of two large buying firms, we mapped factors that initiated and improved environmental capabilities in small- and medium-sized enterprises over time. Through several specific mechanisms, buyers' green supply chain management initiated and then enabled the improvement of suppliers' environmental capabilities. Independent of buyers, internal championing of environmental concerns also provided an impetus for small- and. medium-sized enterprise suppliers to acquire resources outside the supply chain. Thus, synergistic linkages emerged in supportive buyer-supplier relationships, resource acquisition, and capability development. When these findings are combined with earlier research on larger suppliers, an integrative framework emerges that provides direction for suppliers, buyers, and public agencies seeking to improve environmental performance.

First, because multifunction products provide complete or partial functionalities of single-function products, we incorporate substitution or cannibalization effects between the potential products. Second, we explicitly model the variable costs of manufacturing the single-function and multifunction products. Third, we examine the firm's pricing decisions because of their impact on the degree of cannibalization between the multifunction product and one or more single-function products. Using an economic model, we first characterize the firm's optimal product portfolio (through a quantity-based decision), which in turn determines the market equilibrium prices for each product in its portfolio. Some of the unique insights stemming from our analysis are: (a) the optimal product portfolio choice is driven primarily by maximum profit margins for the single-function products weighted by the demand substitution effects; and (6) from a product design perspective, the complete functionality of the base single-function product is always included in the optimal product offering, but this is not necessarily the case with the complete functionality of the nonbase single-function product.

We call this type of visibility order progress information. In this paper, we investigate how order progress information can be used to improve inventory replenishment decisions. To this end, we examine a retailer facing a stochastic lead time for order fulfillment. We characterize a replenishment policy that is based on the classical (Q,R) policy and that allows for releasing emergency orders in response to the order progress information. We show that the optimal structure of this policy is given by a sequence of threshold values dependent on order progress information. In a numerical Study we evaluate the cost savings due to this improved replenishment policy.

However, the benefits of sharing information can vary depending on the supply chain structure and its operational characteristics. Most of the existing research has studied the impact of sharing downstream information (e.g., a manufacturer sharing information with its suppliers). We evaluate the benefits of sharing upstream yield information (e.g., a supplier sharing information with the manufacturer) in a two-stage serial supply chain in which the supplier has multiple internal processes and is faced with uncertain Output due to yield losses. We are interested in determining when the sharing of the supplier's information is most beneficial to the manufacturer. After proposing an order-up-to type heuristic policy, we perform a detailed computational study and observe that this information is most beneficial when the supplier's yield variance is high and when end-customer demand variance is low. We also find that the manufacturer's backorder-to-holding cost ratio has little, if any, impact on the usefulness of information.

J	Akcay, Y; Tan, B				Akcay, Yalcin; Tan, Baris			On the Benefits of Assortment-Based Cooperation Among Independent Producers	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cooperation; network organizations; customer choice; assortment pooling	INVENTORY SYSTEMS; AIRLINE ALLIANCES; NASH EQUILIBRIUM; SUPPLY CHAINS; TRANSSHIPMENT; COMPETITION; SUBSTITUTION; RETAILERS; NETWORKS	Motivated by the challenges small- to medium-size companies face in export-oriented industries, we consider a competitive market for a set of substitutable products. Depending on the assortment of the firms and the substitution behavior of the customer, either a product is sold to the customer or the sale is lost. We consider the cooperation of independent producers that offer a combined set of products to their customers. Producers use discounted price contracts to manage the exchange of products among themselves. We propose an analytical model that enables us to determine the characteristics of firms and their products that would facilitate a beneficial cooperation. We conclude that a cooperation between symmetric single-product firms is always beneficial, whereas threshold-type criteria should be satisfied so that assortment-based cooperation is beneficial for asymmetric firms. We also show that commonality in product assortments of cooperating firms has adverse effects on the benefit from cooperation. For the most general problem setting, we propose a method to determine the set of firms that should cooperate and set the parameters of the contract among the members of cooperation in such a way that each member of the cooperation is better off. We use a numerical study to draw insights on the conditions for which our cooperation scheme is beneficial in the most general problem setting.

J	Mukhopadhyay, SK; Zhu, X; Yue, X				Mukhopadhyay, Samar K.; Zhu, Xiaowei; Yue, Xiaohang			Optimal Contract Design for Mixed Channels Under Information Asymmetry	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						channel conflict; information asymmetry; mixed channel; value-adding retailer	CAPACITATED SUPPLY CHAINS; STRATEGIC ANALYSIS; POLICY	The mixed-charinel model is becoming increasingly Popular in the marketplace. In this model, a firm selling through the traditional supply chain of wholesaler and retailer opens a direct channel to the customer through Internet sales. Because both channels have their respective advantages, the manufacturer is attracted to this business model. However, it also leads to channel conflict, with the retailer feeling threatened by direct competition. One way of eliminating the possibility of this channel conflict, where the retailer is allowed to add value to the product to differentiate its offering to the customers, is proposed in this paper. The retailer is also given full authority to make pricing decisions. This paper presents a model, under this scenario, of obtaining optimum pricing decisions by both parties, the amount of value added by the retailer, and the manufacturer's wholesale price to the retailer. Our model incorporates information asymmetry, where the manufacturer has incomplete information about the retailer's cost of adding value. We obtain closed-form contracts with incomplete information and compare them with those with complete channel coordination. We also develop a number of managerial guidelines and identify future research topics.

Product design for life-cycle mismatch	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product design; life cycle; part obsolescence; procurement; sourcing	OBSOLESCENCE; DIFFUSION; MODEL	Life-cycle mismatch occurs when the life cycle of a product does not coincide with the life cycles of the parts used in that product. This is particularly a problem with products that contain electronic components that sometimes have life spans of only two years. The cost of mitigating component obsolescence, which may require redesigning the product, is often considerable. Thus, prudent product design necessitates the selection of electronic components and product architecture, considering the cost of mitigating an obsolete design and other costs related to the design and manufacture of a product.

Managing slow-moving perishables in the grocery industry	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						value of information; vendor-managed inventory; supply chain management; perishable inventory	SUPPLY CHAIN; DEMAND INFORMATION; INVENTORY SYSTEM	W e address the value of information and value of centralized control in the context of a two-echelon, serial supply chain with one retailer and one supplier that provide a single perishable product to consumers. Our analysis is relevant for managing slow-moving perishable products with fixed lot sizes and expiration dates of a week or less. We evaluate two supply chain structures. In the first structure, referred to as decentralized information sharing, the retailer shares its demand, inventory, and ordering policy with the supplier, yet both facilities make their own profit-maximizing replenishment decisions. In the second structure, centralized control, incentives are aligned and the replenishment decisions are coordinated. The latter supply chain structure corresponds to the industry practices of company-owned stores or vendor-managed inventory. We measure the value of information and value of centralized control as the marginal improvement in expected profits that a supply chain achieves relative to the case when no information is shared and decision making is decentralized. Key assumptions of our model include stochastic demand, lost sales, and fixed order quantities. We establish the importance of information sharing and centralized control in the supply chain and identify conditions under which benefits are realized. As opposed to previous work on the value of information, the major benefit in our setting is driven by the supplier's ability to provide the retailer with fresher product. By isolating the benefit by firm, we show that sharing information is not always Pareto-improving for both supply chain partners in the decentralized setting.

J	Li, ZL; Gao, L				Li, Zhaolin; Gao, Long			The effects of sharing upstream information on product rollover	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information sharing; supply chain coordination; product rollover; contracting and incentives	SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION; CHANNEL COORDINATION; ENVIRONMENT; RETAILER; UPGRADES	T he process of introducing new and phasing out old products is called product rollover. This paper considers a periodic-review inventory system consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, where the manufacturer introduces new and improved products over an infinite planning horizon using the solo-roll strategy. We consider two scenarios: (1) the manufacturer does not share the upstream information about new-product introduction with the retailer and (2) the manufacturer shares the information. For each scenario, we first derive the decentralized ordering policy and the system-optimal ordering policy with given cost parameters. We then devise an optimal supply chain contract that coordinates the inventory system. We demonstrate that when the inventory system is coordinated, information sharing improves the performance of both supply chain entities. However, this may not be true if the inventory system is not coordinated. We also show that under the optimal contract, the manufacturer has no incentive to mislead the retailer about new-product information in the information-sharing model. When demand variability increases, information sharing adds more benefits to the coordinated supply chain. Our research provides insights about coordinating product, financial, and information flows in supply chains with product rollover.

J	Zhao, X				Zhao, Xuan			Coordinating a supply chain system with retailers under both price and inventory competition	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing; inventory; competition; coordination	CHANNEL	We investigate a supply chain system with a common supplier selling to downstream retailers who are engaged in both price and inventory competition. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for the retailer game and study how a supplier can coordinate the system to achieve the best performance. Our main conclusions are as follows: First, a buyback contract can be used to coordinate retailers competing on both price and inventory in a sense that optimal retail prices and inventory levels arise as the Pareto-dominant equilibrium. With symmetric retailers, the system optimum arises as the unique symmetric equilibrium. Second, the particular type of competition experienced by retailers (price versus inventory competition) affects the characteristics of the contract. Specifically, strong price competition leads to a coordination mechanism with a positive buyback rate, where the supplier subsidizes retailers for leftover inventories; however, strong inventory competition leads to a negative buyback rate, where retailers are punished for overstocking. Using a linear expected demand function, we further explore the impact of system parameters on the coordination contract and the competitive equilibrium. We also find that the performance of the supplier's optimal contract is asymptotic to the system optimal coordination contract as competition becomes fierce.

The objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. Obtaining an efficient algorithm for an optimum k-unit cyclic solution (k >= 1) has been a longstanding open problem. For both single-gripper and dual-gripper cells, the approximation algorithms in this paper provide the best-known performance guarantees (obtainable in polynomial time) for an optimal cyclic solution. We provide two algorithms that have a running time linear in the number of machines: for single-gripper cells (respectively, dual-gripper cells), the performance guarantee is 9/7 (respectively, 3/2). The domain considered is free-pickup cells with constant intermachine travel time. Our structural analysis is an important step toward resolving the complexity status of finding an optimal cyclic solution in either a single-gripper or a dual-gripper cell. We also identify optimal cyclic solutions for a variety of special cases.

J	Dana, JD				Dana, James D., Jr.			New directions in revenue management research	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; pricing		Research in revenue management is rapidly changing as the environment in which firms operate changes. The Internet, the adoption of new information technologies, and other market forces are driving a new wave of research in revenue management. At the same time, more and more industries are adapting the tools of revenue management to their needs. Promising research directions are more sophisticated models of consumer behavior, more general models and understanding of rivalry, and more general pricing mechanisms. These are important issues for today's revenue managers and promising areas for both theoretical and empirical research.

This behavior is seen in industries ranging from fashion retail to tour packages and baked goods. A number of authors have addressed the markdown management problem in which a seller seeks to determine the optimal sequence of discounts to maximize the revenue from a fixed stock of perishable goods. However, merchants who consistently use markdown policies risk training customers to "wait for the sale." We investigate models in which the decision to sell inventory at a discount will change the future expectations of customers and hence their buying behavior. We show that, in equilibrium, a single-price policy is optimal if all consumers are strategic and demand is known to the seller. Relaxing any of these conditions can lead to a situation in which a two-price markdown policy is optimal. We show using numerical simulation that if customers update their expectations of availability over time, then optimal sales limit policies can evolve in a complex fashion.

J	Zhang, D; Cooper, WL				Zhang, Dan; Cooper, William L.			Managing clearance sales in the presence of strategic customers	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; clearance pricing; customer behavior	REVENUE MANAGEMENT; INVENTORY; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	We study the effect of strategic customer behavior on pricing and rationing decisions of a firm selling a single product over two periods. The seller may limit the availability of the product (that is, ration) in the second (clearance) period. Some customers are strategic and respond to the firm's decisions by timing their purchases. When capacity is nonconstraining and the seller has pricing flexibility, we show that rationing in the clearance period cannot improve revenue. However, when prices are fixed in advance, rationing can improve revenue. In the latter case, we conduct a detailed analysis for linear and exponential demand curves and derive explicit expressions for optimal rationing levels. We find that the policy of doing the better of not restricting availability at the clearance price or not offering the product at the clearance price is typically near optimal. Our analysis also suggests that rationing-although sometimes offering considerable benefit over allowing unrestricted availability in the clearance period-may allow the seller to obtain only a small fraction of the optimal revenue when the prices are chosen optimally without rationing. We extend the analysis to cases where the capacity is constraining and obtain similar results.

Preston; te Velde, Vera			Dynamic pricing with constant demand elasticity	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; yield management; dynamic pricing; efficient pricing	REVENUE MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; DISPERSION	The celebrated model of Gallego and van Ryzin is specialized to the case of constant elasticity of demand. A closed form is developed, which has an even simpler form than that arising with exponential demand and which possesses an excellent approximation. In this environment, monopoly is efficient, which means that all the behavior usually attributed to monopoly pricing is actually a consequence of efficient pricing and would arise even in a perfectly competitive environment. If the initial supply is not too large, consumers have no incentive to delay their purchases to get a lower price at the average inventory prevailing at any time.	[McAfee, R.

At each period, the retailer places orders to the suppliers in response to the prices they announce. Each supplier has a fixed capacity. We consider a make-to-stock setting where the retailer can carry inventory. The retailer faces exogenous, price-dependent demand. We study the problem using ideas from fluid models. In particular, we (i) analyze when there are pure equilibrium policies in this setting and characterize the structure of these policies; (ii) consider coordination mechanisms; and (iii) present some preliminary computational results. We also consider a modified model that uses option contracts to coordinate the supply chain.

Pricing, allocation, and overbooking in dynamic service network competition when demand is uncertain	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; pricing and allocation; overbooking; dynamic games; variational inequalities	REVENUE MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; GAME	We study the problem of combined pricing, resource allocation, and overbooking by service providers involved in dynamic noncooperative oligopolistic competition on a network that represents the relationships of the providers to one another and to their customers when service demand is uncertain. We propose, analyze, and compute solutions for a model that is more general than other models reported in the revenue management literature to date. In particular, previous models typically consider only three or four of five key revenue management features that we have purposely built into our model: (1) pricing, (2) resource allocation, (3) dynamic competition, (4) an explicit network, and (5) uncertain demand. Illustrative realizations of the abstract problem we study are those of airline revenue management and service provision by companies facing resource constraints. Under fairly general regularity conditions, we prove existence and uniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for dynamic oligopolistic service network competition described by our model. We also show, for an appropriate notion of regularity, that competition leads to the underpricing of network services, a finding numerically illustrated by an example of intermediate size. Our proposed algorithm can be implemented using well-known off-the-shelf commercial software.

J	Dietrich, B; Paleologo, GA; Wynter, L				Dietrich, Brenda; Paleologo, Giuseppe A.; Wynter, Laura			Revenue management in business services	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; services; services science; service engineering	CONTRACT DESIGN	A significant portion of the services industry is focused on providing services (medical, legal, financial, personal, and travel) to individuals. However, studies have shown that a less visible but rapidly growing segment of the service sector comprises firms that provide business functions to other businesses. The sector covers tasks such as payroll processing, procurement, and information systems management, as well as business consulting, technical support, call center operations, and software development. Firms may choose to purchase, rather than perform, these business functions to reduce costs, to mitigate risk, or simply to focus on their processes that provide marketplace differentiation. Transferring a business function from within a firm to an Outside supplier is often called "outsourcing"; when the supplier provides the service from a lower-cost country, it is called "offshoring." The risks and benefits of outsourcing to the firm purchasing a business service have been studied in some detail by both academics and consultants. In this paper, we outline revenue management issues faced by business service providers and describe some new opportunities for the use of analytic methods in the service science sector.

Even large manufacturing firms are seeing dramatic shifts in percent revenue derived from services. The need for service innovations to fuel further economic growth and to raise the quality and productivity levels of services has never been greater. Services are moving to center stage in the global arena, especially knowledge-intensive business services aimed at business performance transformation. One challenge to systematic service innovation is the interdisciplinary nature of service, integrating technology, business, social, and client (demand) innovations. This paper describes the emergence of service science, a new interdisciplinary area of study that aims to address the challenge of becoming more systematic about innovating in service.

First, we operationally define and discuss the concept of customer experience. In this context, we propose a reframing of the strategic role of operations strategy as one of choreographing experience-centric services. We then introduce the concept of services as destinations as an emerging business model for classifying experiential service strategies. Our conceptual typology of experience-based strategies uses two dimensions: (1) the depth of use of experience as a source of value creation, ranging from brand experience to the services as a destinations business model, and (2) the degree of integration of experience internally within the firm. Using this conceptual typology, we develop five propositions and use multiple cases to illustrate firms' use of these experience strategies. Laying the groundwork for future research, we highlight insights from the qualitative, multiple-case data as they pertain to service operations strategy and the business model that employs services as destinations. A number of questions for further research are suggested.

In this paper we argue that new service development success results from building a competence in the management of service development resources and routines. We conceptualize new service development competence as a multidimensional, second-order latent construct that is represented by a system of four interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) formalized new service development processes, (2) market acuity, (3) new service development strategy, and (4) information technology use and experience. We hypothesize that the growth of new service development competence is related to improved new service development performance. Using structural equations modeling, we analyze survey data from 166 retail banks and report three key empirical findings. First, we show that the four hypothesized dimensions are statistically significant in defining new service development competence. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom in new product development, we find that formalized processes play a lesser role in the success of new service development compared with the other three dimensions. Instead, market acuity-which captures the firm's ability to see the competitive environment clearly and to anticipate and respond to customers' evolving needs and wants-was the most important new service development competence indicator. Finally, we demonstrate the positive effect of new service development competence on new service development performance and show that new service development competence is also significantly related to business-level performance. Together, our empirical results suggest that complementary benefits arise from the adoption of a more holistic approach to the management of new service development at the program level.

Managing these deposits is an important and complex inventory problem for two reasons. First, Federal Reserve regulations require that depository institutions hold certain amounts of such deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks to satisfy statutory reserve requirements against customers' transaction accounts (demand deposits and other checkable deposits). Second, some inventory of such deposits is essential for banks to operate one of their core lines of business: furnishing payment services to households and firms. Because the Federal Reserve does not pay interest on such deposits used to satisfy statutory reserve requirements, banks seek to minimize their inventory of such deposits. In 1994, the banking industry introduced a new inventory management tool for such deposits, the retail deposit sweep program, which avoids the statutory requirement by reclassifying transaction deposits as savings deposits. This is an interesting inventory problem for fungible items, where the conversion process is reversible. We examine two methods for operating such sweeps programs within the limits of Federal Reserve regulations, and we develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to implement one such method, the threshold method.

This paper will show that there is no single answer. For the simple but generic situation of two (strictly pooled or unpooled) server groups, it will provide (1) insights and approximate formulae, (2) numerical support, and (3) general conclusions for the waiting-time effect of pooling. For a single call type, this effect is clearly positive, as represented by a pooling factor. With multiple job types, however, the effect is determined by both a pooling and a mix factor. Due to the mix factor, this effect might even be negative. In this case, it is also numerically illustrated that an improvement of both the unpooled and the strictly pooled scenario can be achieved by simple overflow or threshold scenarios. The results are of both practical and theoretical interest: practical for awareness of this negative effect, the numerical orders, and practical scenarios in call centers, and theoretical for further research in more complex situations.

An abundance of literature has already been published on call centers. Here, we want to focus on centers that would typically occur in business-to-business environments; these are call centers that handle many types of calls but where the arrival rate for each type is low. To find an optimal configuration, the integrality of the decision variables is a much more important issue than for larger call centers. The present paper proposes an approach that uses elements of combinatorial optimization to find optimal configurations. We develop an approximation method for the evaluation of the service performance. Next, we search for the minimum-cost configuration subject to service-level constraints using a branch-and-bound algorithm. What is at stake is to find the right balance between gains resulting from the economies of scale of pooling and the higher cost or cross-trained agents. The article shows that in most cases this method significantly decreases the staffing cost compared with configurations with only cross-trained or dedicated operators.

Research has documented the reality of retail price dispersion, but little is known about how retail markups, in particular, are related to service quality and product attributes. For example, do Internet retailers deliver superior service in return for high markups? Do product characteristics affect the relationship between service and markups for retailers? To examine these issues, we first developed a model of Internet retail profitability that separates revenues and costs related to sales from other profit sources. This framework allowed us to position our work alongside the extant literature about Internet retailing. Moreover, it led us to synthesize service quality dimensions found in Internet retailing studies. We subsequently developed a critical-event study based on the profit model and the synthesis of service quality dimensions to delineate service aspects that retailers should emphasize to address buyers' utility. Finally, we collected data from Internet purchases across retailers to isolate markup-service quality trade-offs along our delineated service aspects. We find that high markups are associated with superior performance across service quality dimensions. Furthermore, this trade-off becomes more acutely defined when products with variable popularity are transacted.

In the latter approach, appointment intervals are adjusted to match the consultation time characteristics of different patient classes. Our simulation results indicate that new appointment systems that utilize interval adjustment for patient class are successful in improving doctors' idle time, doctors' overtime and patients' waiting times without any trade-offs. Best performing appointment systems are identified for different clinic environments characterized by walk-ins, no-shows, the percentage of new patients, and the ratio of the mean consultation time of new patients to the mean consultation time of return patients. As a result, practical guidelines are developed for managers who are responsible for designing appointment systems.

Introduction to the special issue on theory development in operations management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Editorial Material						theory; empirical; operations	EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH	Rigorous development of theory in operations management has been lacking. Although many theories have been proposed, they are often not developed in a format and depth that can be falsified, refined, or supported. This special issue includes three papers that illustrate rigorous development of theory for future testing using mathematical, simulation, or managerial approaches.

J	Xue, M; Field, JM				Xue, Mei; Field, Joy M.			Service coproduction with information stickiness and incomplete contracts: Implications for consulting services design	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information stickiness; service coproduction; incomplete contract theory; consulting services; service process design	KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; CUSTOMER CONTACT; CLIENT COPRODUCTION; ORGANIZATIONS; MANAGEMENT; FIRM; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPLEMENTATIONS; RENEGOTIATION	Drawing from three theoretical bases-"information stickiness" from the knowledge management literature,'service coproduction" from the service operations management literature, and "incomplete contract theory" from the transaction cost economics literature-we discuss a theoretical framework and develop models to study the efficiency of the service coproduction process in a knowledge-intensive consulting environment. We apply, refine, and interpret these theories to determine how work should be allocated between the consultant and the client and the corresponding pricing under different contractual relationships that occur in this industry. We find that, with a pricing schedule that relates the fee adjustment to the self-service level and one party's ownership of the residual right to specify the workload allocation, the client underinvests her efforts in the service coproduction process, whereas the consultant overinvests his efforts, resulting in an inefficient process. In addition, to improve overall process efficiency, we show that the more productive party should own the residual right to respecify the self-service level when the final service need emerges. Our results, as well as interview data from experienced consultants, provide insights into the causes of inefficient service delivery processes and offer direction for achieving better efficiency through contract design and pricing schedules.

System dynamics as a structural theory in operations management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						system dynamics; structural theory; modeling; simulation; operations strategy	SUPPLY CHAIN; EMPIRICAL-RESEARCH; DECISION-MAKING; INDUSTRIAL DYNAMICS; FUTURE-RESEARCH; MODELS; SIMULATION; THINKING; IMPACT; HARD	The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of (1) system dynamics as a structural theory for operations management and (2) system dynamics models as content theories in operations management. The key findings are that, although feedback loops, accumulation processes, and delays exist and are widespread in operations management, often these phenomena are ignored completely or not considered appropriately. Hence, it is reasoned why system dynamics is well suited as an approach for many operations management studies, and it is shown how system dynamics theory can be used to explain, analyze, and understand such phenomena in operations management. The discussion is based on a literature review and on conceptual considerations, with examples of operations management studies based on system dynamics. Implications of using this theory include the necessary re-framing of some operations management issues and the extension of empirical studies by dynamic modeling and simulation. The value of the paper lies in the conceptualization of the link between system dynamics and operations management, which is discussed on the level of theory.

To address this gap in the literature, we conduct a longitudinal case study of a manufacturing facility belonging to a division of a Fortune 1000 discrete manufacturing firm as it seeks to transition from mass production to mass customization. We empirically identify five factors hindering the mass production-to-mass customization transition within the research site and articulate five corresponding generalizations explaining how and why these hindrance factors relate to the mass production-to-mass customization transition hazard beyond the research site (i.e., how and why the five hindrance factors, in general, threaten the likelihood of a successful mass production-to-mass customization transition). We then theoretically validate the five hindrance factors and corresponding generalizations by mapping them onto the antecedents and tenets of structural inertia theory. We conclude with a brief discussion of the scientific and pragmatic significance of the findings and highlight opportunities for future research.	[Rungtusanatham, M.

In such scenarios, there is a trade-off between the costs of obtaining information and the benefits that accrue to the owners of such information. There are also various ways in which the missing information can be obtained or inferred. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of obtaining information via the classical mechanism design approach, which relies on the information available before the contracts are designed, with that of an "audit-based" approach, which relies on the information obtained after the fact. In our model, a single buyer (the Stackelberg leader) wishes to procure a package of products or services from various competing suppliers that possess private cost information. We allow for arbitrary cost and revenue functions and can incorporate multiple cost and revenue drivers. We show how the buyer can optimize her profit and at the same time coordinate the channel by using a contract scheme involving auctions, audits, and profit sharing. We also examine the behavior of this mechanism when the supplier can exert effort to reduce cost but the cost of effort cannot be verified. We propose several mechanisms for different precontract informational scenarios and compare their performance.

Stockless operations under competition	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						online retailing; stockless operation; duopoly competition; pricing; inventory management	OPTIMAL INVENTORY POLICIES; MODEL; DEMAND; PRICE	Due to the proliferation of electronic commerce and the development of Internet technologies, many firms have considered new pricing-inventory models. In this paper, we study the role of stockless (i.e., zeroinventory) operations in online retailing by a considering duopoly competition in which two retailers compete to maximize profit by jointly optimizing their pricing and inventory decisions. In our model, the retailers are allowed to choose either an in-stock policy or stockless operations with a discounted price. We first present the characteristics and properties of the equilibrium. We then demonstrate that the traditional outcome of asymmetric Bertrand competition is observed under head-to-head competition. However, when the two firms choose different operational policies, with corresponding optimal pricing, they can share the market under certain conditions. Finally, we report interesting observations on the interaction between pricing and inventory decisions obtained from an extensive computational study.

Asymmetric competition in B2B spot markets	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						B2B markets; supply chain; spot markets; competition; information	SUPPLY CHAIN; PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; CONTRACTS	We model strategic behavior of two types of suppliers in B2B spot markets: a supplier that has forward contracts and uses the spot market only for inventory liquidation, and a supplier that uses the spot market as its sole selling channel. We find that when the spot market demand is small, the supplier that has forward contracts has a higher incentive to invest in expanding the spot market. When the spot market demand exceeds a threshold size, this situation is reversed, and the supplier with no contracts benefits more from making the spot market more prevalent. We show that a supplier with forward contracts benefits from the existence of the spot market more than a supplier with no contracts and that this result holds with both negative and positive correlation between spot market demand and contracted demand. We find that suppliers producing only for the spot market gain from working in industries where contracted demand and spot market demand are positively correlated, whereas suppliers that have forward contracts benefit from working in industries with a negative correlation between demands, since it allows them to better manage risk. In addition, both total industry supply and spot market supply are higher in industries where demands are negatively correlated.

Application development using fault data	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						software development; threshold policy; fault growth model; dynamic programming	SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; PROJECTS; MODELS; COMMUNICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; COORDINATION; POLICY	We develop a general model for software development process and propose a policy to manage system coordination using system fault reports (e.g., interface inconsistencies, parameter mismatches, etc.). These reports are used to determine the timing of coordination activities that remove faults. We show that under an optimal policy, coordination should be performed only if a "threshold" fault count has been exceeded. We apply the policy to software development processes and compare the management of those projects under different development conditions. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate how the fault threshold policy needs to be adjusted to changes in system complexity, team skill, development environment, and project schedule. Moreover, we compare the optimal fault threshold policy to an optimal release-based policy. The release-based policy does not take into account fault data and is easier to administer. The comparisons help to define the range of project parameters for which observing fault data can provide significant benefits for managing a software project.

Benchmarking and monitoring international warehouse operations in Europe	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						European distribution centers; warehouses; operations; benchmarking; monitoring		We report on a cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of European distribution centers in the Netherlands. European distribution centers are responsible for the distribution of a manufacturer's (mostly Asian or American) products over customers in a large part of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, often with strict service-level agreements. In total, 65 physical warehouses, containing 140 European, Asian, and American European distribution center operations, in combination with different outsourcing relations (own-account, dedicated outsourced, and public outsourced), were benchmarked in 2000 and monitored over the period 2000 - 2004. We conclude that both in 2000 and 2004, European warehouses are more efficient than Asian and American warehouses, and outsourced operations (particularly public warehouses) are more efficient than own-account operations. Over the period 2000 - 2004, efficiency appears to have declined substantially; the most distinct differences are to be found among public outsourced warehouses and, because many European distribution center warehouse operations of European origin are run by public service providers, among European warehouses. This decline in efficiency also led to a decline in productivity, in spite of the fact that overall the available technology has improved. We conjecture potential causes for this decline.

We study the potential use of a flexible backup supplier as an emergency response to accurate lead-time information arriving at (or close after) the beginning of the demand interval and well after an original order with the stochastic lead-time supplier has been placed. The emergency response decisions involve whether to order and how much from the flexible backup supplier, with the objective of minimizing the cost of meeting demand. We derive the optimal emergency-response policy and clearly outline its implications on the optimized safety lead time of the original order placement and on the cost of meeting demand. We examine the impact on the use of the flexible backup supplier of factors like the arrival time of accurate lead-time information and the response lead time of the backup supplier. We further study the potential benefits of the use of the flexible backup supplier in a dual role: as one of the two suppliers in a redundant supply system assigned to originally meet the demand and as an emergency response to later-arriving lead-time information. Our numerical studies illustrate the benefits from the use of the flexible backup supplier as an emergency response, but for reasonable purchase premiums and short lead times of flexible backup supply options, their use in a dual (regular and emergency response) role often leads to improved performance over safety lead-time single and uncertain leadtime supplier-replenishment strategies. The benefits of the backup supply options are accentuated the higher the lead-time uncertainty of the stochastic lead-time supplier is.

Contracting under vendor managed inventory systems using holding cost subsidies	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						vendor managed inventory; coordination; contracting; multiperiod model; holding cost subsidy	SUPPLY CHAIN; STOCHASTIC DEMAND; POLICIES; COORDINATION	Vendor managed inventory systems are becoming increasingly popular. An important issue in implementing a vendor managed inventory scheme is the contracting terms that dictate the ownership of the inventory and the responsibility of inventory replenishment decisions. Thus the performance of a vendor managed system crucially depends on these terms and on how inventory-related costs are shared in a supply chain. We consider a system where a manufacturer supplies a single product to a retailer who faces random demand in a competitive market. The retailer incurs a fixed cost per order, inventory holding cost, and a penalty cost for a stockout (unsatisfied demand is back-ordered). Further, the manufacturer incurs a penalty cost when there is a stockout at the retailer and a fixed replenishment cost. We assume that the players are rational and act noncooperatively. We compare the performance of retailer managed inventory systems, where the retailer places orders and makes replenishment decisions, with vendor managed inventory systems, wherein the vendor or manufacturer makes inventory and replenishment decisions. Specifically, in the vendor managed inventory system, we propose and evaluate holding cost subsidy-type contracts on inventories offered by the retailer to improve system performance. We evaluate this contract in the context of three widely used inventory systems-deterministic economic order quantity, continuous review (Q, r) policies, and periodic review policies-and show when such contracts may improve channel performance.

Route-independent analysis of available capacity in flexible manufacturing systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity analysis; flexible manufacturing systems; aggregate production planning; sensitivity analysis; mathematical programming	PLANNING PROBLEMS; SELECTION	In a job shop, because of large setup times, each operation is assigned to only one machine. There is no alternative routing. In a flexible manufacturing system, each manufacturing operation can often be performed on several machines. Therefore, with automated equipment, the capacity of a machine to perform certain operations is not independent of the capacity of other machines. Often, however, operations managers can use a route-independent answer to production planning questions. For example, how much can be produced of a certain part type and when are important capacity questions in business negotiations, when the detailed routing and scheduling are not yet of interest or cannot be known. This paper provides a mathematical model for the route-independent analysis of the capacity of flexible manufacturing systems based on a concept of operation types. An example is provided both to illustrate the use of operation types and to highlight the differences between the traditional route-dependent and the proposed route-independent formulations of capacity constraints. Some computational results are also given. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is developed to analyze the feasibility of production plans when production requirements and machine capacities can change.

J	Arkali, G; Dawande, M; Sriskandarajah, C				Arkali, Goekcen; Dawande, Milind; Sriskandarajah, Chelliah			Scheduling support times for satellites with overlapping visibilities	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						LEO satellites; complexity; algorithms; optimization; service scheduling	SYSTEMS; ISSUES; OPPORTUNITIES	We consider the scheduling of ground station support times to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with overlapping visibilities. LEO satellites typically complete a revolution around the Earth in less than four hours at an altitude of a few hundred miles and are part of the critical infrastructure for natural resource management, crop yield estimation, meteorology, flood control, communication, and space research. Because these satellites are quite expensive to launch and operate, utilizing them in the best possible manner is of paramount importance for the agencies that own them. A ground station provides support time to a satellite to perform a variety of tasks when the satellite is visible to the station over a prespecified planning horizon; the payoff from providing such support is a function of the support time. When two or more satellites pass over the ground station, their visibility time windows may overlap. Thus, under overlapping visibilities, a relevant problem is that of scheduling ground station support time for each satellite with the objective of maximizing the total utility generated from supporting the satellites. We propose four basic scheduling models to address a variety of scenarios and investigate their computational complexities. For each model, we also identify special cases that are polynomially solvable.

J	Lee, D; Mendelson, H				Lee, Deishin; Mendelson, Haim			Divide and conquer: Competing with free technology under network effects	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						open source; network effects; free technology; market segmentation; first-mover advantage	OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; COMPATIBILITY; STANDARDIZATION; EXTERNALITIES; PERFORMANCE; DEVELOPERS; MOTIVATION; INNOVATION; DECISIONS	We study how a commercial firm competes with a free open source product. The market consists of two customer segments with different preferences and is characterized by positive network effects. The commercial firm makes product and pricing decisions to maximize its profit. The open source developers make product decisions to maximize the weighted sum of the segments' consumer surplus, in addition to their intrinsic motivation. The more importance open source developers attach to consumer surplus, the more effort they put into developing software features. Even if consumers do not end up adopting the open source product, it can act as a credible threat to the commercial firm, forcing the firm to lower its prices. If the open source developers' intrinsic motivation is high enough, they will develop software regardless of eventual market dynamics. If the open source product is available first, all participants are better off when the commercial and open source products are compatible. However, if the commercial firm can enter the market first, it can increase its profits and gain market share by being incompatible with its open source competitor, even if customers can later switch at zero cost. This first-mover advantage does not arise because users are "locked in," but because the commercial firm deploys a "divide and conquer" strategy to attract early adopters and exploit late adopters. To capitalize on its first-mover advantage, the commercial firm must increase its development investment to improve its product features.

J	Haruvy, E; Sethi, SP; Zhou, J				Haruvy, Ernan; Sethi, Suresh P.; Zhou, Jing			Open source development with a commercial complementary product or service	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing research; optimal control; open source; network externalities	NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; 2-SIDED MARKETS; DESIGN QUALITY; TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITION; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; INVENTORY; ADOPTION; SYSTEMS	We examine optimal control decisions regarding pricing, network size, and hiring strategy in the context of open source software development. Opening the source code to a software product often implies that consumers would not pay for the software product itself. However, revenues may be generated from complementary products. A software firm may be willing to open the source code to its software if it stands to build a network for its complementary products. The rapid network growth is doubly crucial in open source development, in which the users of the firm's products are also contributors of code that translates to future quality improvements. To determine whether or not to open the source, a software firm must jointly optimize prices for its various products while simultaneously managing its product quality network size, and employment strategy. Whether or not potential gains in product quality, network size, and labor savings are sufficient to justify opening the source code depends on product and demand characteristics of both the software and the complementary product, as well as on the cost and productivity of in-house developers relative to open source contributors. This paper investigates these crucial elements to allow firms to reach the optimal decision in choosing between the open and closed source models.

A strategy for opening a new market and encroaching on the lower end of the existing market	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						diffusion; disruptive innovation; low-end encroachment; willingness to cannibalize; blue ocean strategy	RADICAL PRODUCT INNOVATION; CONJOINT-ANALYSIS; DIFFUSION; SUBSTITUTION; MODEL; TECHNOLOGIES; COMPETITION; INCUMBENCY; RESOURCE; ADOPTION	We identify and analyze a scenario where a firm first opens up what we call a "detached" market, by offering a new product that meets a customer need that is very different from (i.e., detached from) the need met by the old established product. Our analysis builds on the previous studies that describe alternate ways in which a new product might open a new market and ultimately encroach on an existing market. Consider the example of cell phones: They opened up a new detached market by meeting the customer need for mobility, a need very different from the traditional attribute of reception quality. By meeting an important detached need, a new product can sell at a high price, even though it might be woefully deficient with regard to the traditional performance dimension (the reception/coverage of early cell phones was sorely lacking). A person who is a high-end customer for the old product initially despises the new product as a replacement for the old one but might simultaneously be one of the first customers for the new product because it fills the detached-market need. Over time, the new product improves along the traditional dimension (e.g., cell phone reception/coverage has dramatically improved), and eventually it becomes a replacement for the old product, encroaching from the lower end upward (the first customers to drop their landlines have been lower-end customers such as students and apartment dwellers, whereas higher-end business customers still have landlines in their offices). We call this the detached-market form of low-end encroachment and show how it helps explain the conundrum of an expensive "disruptive" innovation. We go on to relate our results to the finding that "willingness to cannibalize" is a key factor in an incumbent firm's growth and survival, and to the "blue ocean strategy.".

We develop a simple, stochastic model of a firm making investment decisions in process improvement. Our analysis offers several interesting insights into investments in process improvement. First, early investment in process improvement results in valuable knowledge, which helps increase the value of the option to invest in process improvement in future periods. This may motivate a firm to invest in process improvements as early as possible. Second, it may be optimal for a firm to stop investing when such investments do not create enough value in the later stages of the investment horizon. Third, although one would expect the state of a firm's process relative to that of other firms to impact a firm's decision to invest in process improvement, this study finds that the impetus is conditional and identifies these conditions. Finally, in such an environment, the delay of investment in process improvement incurs an opportunity cost for a firm, and we show that the traditional net present value rule must incorporate this opportunity cost and the knowledge-induced change in future option values to lead to a correct investment decision.

J	Fung, MK				Fung, Michael K.			To what extent are labor-saving technologies improving efficiency in the use of human resources? Evidence from the banking industry	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						labor-saving technology; human resources; efficiency; banking	FIRM-LEVEL EVIDENCE; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; SKILL COMPLEMENTARITY; PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH; ELECTRONIC MARKETS; HOLDING COMPANIES; SERVICE QUALITY; FUTURE-RESEARCH	With special reference to the banking industry, the objective of this study is to address managerial concerns over the impact of labor-saving technologies on efficiency in the use of human resources. A bank is viewed as a collection of human, technology, and capital resources. Labor-saving technologies are represented by two categories of technology resources-information technologies and patented in-house process innovations. The estimation of a stochastic frontier manpower-requirement function shows that, whereas information technology resources have a direct impact on efficiency in the use of human resources, in-house process innovations have an indirect impact through spillovers. The reduction in labor costs resulting from a more efficient use of human resources is more than enough to cover the required increase in information technology expenditures. This cost-reducing impact is stronger for firms currently employing a lower level of information technologies. The empirical findings also suggest a complementary relationship between information technologies and spillovers of in-house process innovations. The empirical framework proposed in this study can help decision makers determine the optimal input mix of technology and human resources.

J	Bendoly, E; Bachrach, DG; Powell, B				Bendoly, Elliot; Bachrach, Daniel G.; Powell, Benjamin			The role of operational interdependence and supervisory experience on management assessments of resource planning systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						enterprise resource planning; interdependence; supervisors; experience	INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; ACCEPTANCE MODEL; PERFORMANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; ENTERPRISE; IMPACT; ERP; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; INTEGRATION	Greater interdependence among workers and activities not only increases the need for internal communication, but it also imposes complications and barriers to effective information exchange. Intraorganizational communication capabilities of certain information systems can help overcome these barriers. However, the extent to which certain systems are promoted as communication tools depends largely on management's interpretation of their usefulness, which in turn may be largely dependent on operational context and managerial experience. We use a controlled experimental approach to study how these issues interact to impact managerial assessments of resource planning systems. Results show that managers value the communication capabilities of resource planning systems more so in highly task-interdependent contexts and that these assessments are still more positive among managers with greater supervisory experience. As a result, these findings pose direct implications regarding the management support of technology use.

J	Ba, SL; Johansson, WC				Ba, Sulin; Johansson, Wayne C.			An exploratory study of the impact of e-service process on online customer satisfaction	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						web-based technological capabilities; technology design of e-service process; online customer satisfaction; electronic service delivery system	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; PERCEIVED EASE; PROFIT CHAIN; QUALITY; ENCOUNTERS; PERSONALIZATION; DETERMINANTS; ANTECEDENTS; PERFORMANCE	AIthough extensive academic research has examined the dynamics of interpersonal interactions between service providers and customers, much less research has investigated customer service encounters through technological interfaces such as the Web in electronic commerce transactions. Corporate websites have become an important point of contact with customers for many companies. Service has been described as one of the most important attributes for online business to influence traffic and sales. However, more research is needed to understand how Web-based technological capabilities of services affect customer satisfaction. In this paper, we propose viewing the interface between online buyers and sellers through the lens of service management to identify possible determinants of online customer satisfaction. A company's website is considered its electronic service delivery system. We look at this electronic service delivery system from its process point of view. Our findings indicate that as the electronic service delivery system process improves, a customer's perception of the website's ease of use increases, leading to increased service value and perceived control over the process, which increases customer satisfaction. The research provides evidence that the technological capabilities embedded in the website processes are an important factor in determining service quality and ultimately online customer satisfaction.
