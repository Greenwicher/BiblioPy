J	Bakshi, N; Kleindorfer, P				Bakshi, Nitin; Kleindorfer, Paul			Co-opetition and Investment for Supply-Chain Resilience	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						security; supply chain disruptions; risk; bargaining	BARGAINING PROBLEM; INVENTORY PROBLEM; DISRUPTION RISKS; PROBABILITIES; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; SECURITY; IMPACT	This paper considers the problem of disruption risk management in global supply chains. We consider a supply chain with two participants, who face interdependent losses resulting from supply chain disruptions such as terrorist strikes and natural hazards. The Harsanyi-Selten-Nash bargaining framework is used to model the supply chain participants' choice of risk mitigation investments. The bargaining approach allows a framing of both joint financing of mitigation activities before the fact and loss-sharing net of insurance payouts after the fact. The disagreement outcome in the bargaining game is assumed to be the result of the corresponding non-cooperative game. We describe an incentive-compatible contract that leads to First Best investment and equal "gain" for all players, when the solution is "interior" (as it almost certainly is in practice). A supplier that has superior security practices (i.e., is inherently safer) exploits its informational advantage by extracting an "information rent" in the usual spirit of incomplete information games. We also identify a special case of this contract, which is robust to moral hazard. The role of auditing in reinforcing investment incentives is also examined.

How to Win "Spend" and Influence Partners: Lessons in Behavioral Operations from the Outsourcing Game	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; procurement; negotiation; simulation; cognitive biases	POWER; ECONOMICS	The Outsourcing Game is a role-play simulation that has been deployed in industry and academic training courses worldwide. It incorporates the concepts of hidden actions, hidden information, and misaligned incentives, and conveys messages about power, trust, and reputation. The game depicts the adventures of Acme, the brand owner of a product manufactured by an outsourced supply chain. Through a series of negotiations, Acme attempts to influence its partners (two suppliers and two service providers) by distributing its procurement "spend." These partners, in turn, sway each other via side payments. To simulate the non-linear shifts in power that occur as outsourcing increases, we represent decision-making by a voting scheme with uneven vote allocations. This paper analyzes a database of game results to reveal behavioral factors that can undermine conspicuous win-win process improvements. For instance, preferences can be sensitive to the sequence in which the alternatives are encountered; decision-makers might value not only their own rewards, but also fairness in the allocation of total gains; and effectiveness of negotiation tactics will vary with community norms of acceptable behavior. Along the way we extend the political economics literature about power in block-based voting by proposing a heuristic approach for incorporating voter preferences.

The Role of Slotting Fees in the Coordination of Assortment Decisions	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; assortment planning; operations; marketing interface; slotting fees	PRODUCT LINE; INVENTORY DECISIONS; DEMAND; ALLOWANCES; RETAILERS; BENEFITS; COSTS	Large numbers of new products introduced annually by manufacturers may strain the relationship between retailers and manufacturers regarding assortments carried by retailers. For example, many retailers in the grocery industry will agree to broaden their assortments only if the manufacturer agrees to pay slotting fees for the new products. We investigate the role played by slotting fees in coordinating the assortment decisions in a supply chain. To do so, we study a single-retailer, single-manufacturer supply chain, where the retailer decides what assortment to offer to end customers. Double marginalization results in a discrepancy between the retailer's optimal assortment and the assortment that maximizes total supply chain profits. We consider a payment scheme that is analogous to slotting fees used in the grocery industry: the manufacturer pays the retailer a per-product fee for every product offered by the retailer in excess of a certain target level. We show that, if the wholesale price is below some threshold level, this payment scheme induces the retailer to offer the supply-chain-optimal assortment and makes both parties better off.

In this paper, we investigate a double-bid business model in which the consumers can bid twice in the NYOP channel, and compare it with the single-bid case. We also study the impact of adding a retailer-own list-price channel on the optimal reserve prices. This paper focuses on achieving some basic understanding on the potential gain of adding a second bid option to a single-bid system and on the potential benefits of adding a list-price channel by the NYOP retailer. We show that a double-bid scenario can outperform a single-bid scenario in both single-channel and dual-channel situations. The optimal reserve price in the double-bid scenario is no less than that in the single-bid case. Furthermore, the addition of a retailer-own list-price channel could push up the reserve prices in both single-bid and double-bid scenarios.

J	Chen, ZL; Pundoor, G				Chen, Zhi-Long; Pundoor, Guruprasad			Integrated Order Scheduling and Packing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						make-to-order supply chain; integrated production-distribution scheduling; order packing; heuristics; worst-case analysis	BATCH DELIVERY COSTS; COMMON DUE-DATE; SINGLE-MACHINE; TARDINESS; EARLINESS; SYSTEMS; MODELS	We consider an integrated production-distribution scheduling model in a make-to-order supply chain consisting of one supplier and one customer. The supplier receives a set of orders from the customer at the beginning of a planning horizon. The supplier needs to process all the orders at a single production line, pack the completed orders to form delivery batches, and deliver the batches to the customer. Each order has a weight, and the total weight of the orders packed in a batch must not exceed the capacity of the delivery batch. Each delivery batch incurs a fixed distribution cost. The problem is to find jointly a schedule for order processing and a way of packing completed orders to form delivery batches such that the total distribution cost (or equivalently, the number of delivery batches) is minimized subject to the constraint that a given customer service level is guaranteed. We consider two customer service constraints-meeting the given deadlines of the orders; or requiring the average delivery lead time of the orders to be within a given threshold. Several problems of the model with each of those constraints are considered. We clarify the complexity of each problem and develop fast heuristics for the NP-hard problems and analyze their worst-case performance bounds. Our computational results indicate that all the heuristics are capable of generating near optimal solutions quickly for the respective problems.

J	Petruzzi, NC; Wee, KE; Dada, M				Petruzzi, Nicholas C.; Wee, Kwan E.; Dada, Maqbool			The Newsvendor Model with Consumer Search Costs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor; heterogeneous consumers; pricing; inventory effects		We study the newsvendor problem when consumers are heterogeneous either in their valuations of the newsvendor's product, in their valuations of an outside option available to them, or in both valuations. In this context, we observe that the outside option, which represents the value that a given consumer associates with choosing not to purchase the newsvendor's product, may be interpreted as a search cost. Taking into consideration whether consumers' valuations differ on either one dimension of heterogeneity or on both dimensions, we develop a framework for classifying newsvendor models that incorporate demand-management effects. In particular, we show that this framework includes both the newsvendor model with price-dependent demand and the newsvendor model with endogenous demand as special cases. In addition to making a conceptual contribution by developing and drawing insights from this framework, we make technical contributions by providing more general sufficient conditions under which the underlying optimization problems are well behaved.

J	Wang, HF; Yan, HM				Wang, Haifeng; Yan, Houmin			Inventory Management for Customers with Alternative Lead Times	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacitated inventory models; lead-time flexibility; demand induction; demand cannibalization	STOCK PRODUCTION SYSTEM; DEMAND CLASSES; DELIVERY MODES; RATIONING POLICY; ALLOCATION; COSTS	It is common for suppliers operating in batch-production mode to deal with patient and impatient customers. This paper considers inventory models in which a supplier provides alternative lead times to its customers: a short or a long lead time. Orders from patient customers can be taken by the supplier and included in the next production cycle, while orders from impatient customers have to be satisfied from the on-hand inventory. We denote the action to commit one unit of on-hand inventory to patient or impatient customers as the inventory-commitment decision, and the initial inventory stocking as the inventory-replenishment decision. We first characterize the optimal inventory-commitment policy as a threshold type, and then prove that the optimal inventory-replenishment policy is a base-stock type. Then, we extend our analysis to models to consider cases of a multi-cycle setting, a supply-capacity constraint, and the on-line charged inventory-holding cost. We also evaluate and compare the performances of the optimal inventory-commitment policy and the inventory-rationing policy. Finally, to further investigate the benefits and pitfalls of introducing an alternative lead-time choice, we use the customer-choice model to study the demand gains and losses, known as demand-induction and demand-cannibalization effects, respectively.

J	Castillo, I; Ingolfsson, A; Sim, T				Castillo, Ignacio; Ingolfsson, Armann; Sim, Thaddeus			Social Optimal Location of Facilities with Fixed Servers, Stochastic Demand, and Congestion	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service facility system design; capacity choice; customer choice; stochastic facility location; social optimum	ALLOCATION MODELS; CALL CENTERS; SERVICE; SYSTEMS; TIME; PERSPECTIVE; DESIGN	We consider two capacity choice scenarios for the optimal location of facilities with fixed servers, stochastic demand, and congestion. Motivating applications include virtual call centers, consisting of geographically dispersed centers, walk-in health clinics, motor vehicle inspection stations, automobile emissions testing stations, and internal service systems. The choice of locations for such facilities influences both the travel cost and waiting times of users. In contrast to most previous research, we explicitly embed both customer travel/connection and delay costs in the objective function and solve the location-allocation problem and choose facility capacities simultaneously. The choice of capacity for a facility that is viewed as a queueing system with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times could mean choosing a service rate for the servers (Scenario 1) or choosing the number of servers (Scenario 2). We express the optimal service rate in closed form in Scenario 1 and the (asymptotically) optimal number of servers in closed form in Scenario 2. This allows us to eliminate both the number of servers and the service rates from the optimization problems, leading to tractable mixed-integer nonlinear programs.

Outsourcing to a Powerful Contract Manufacturer: The Effect of Learning-by-Doing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						outsourcing; learning-by-doing; game theory	CURVE; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION; CAPACITY; IMPACT; COST; ORGANIZATIONS; OPPORTUNITIES; PROCUREMENT	The contract manufacturing industry has grown rapidly in recent years as firms have increasingly outsourced production to reduce costs. This growth has created powerful contract manufacturers (CMs) in several industries. Achieving a competitive cost position is often a primary motive for outsourcing. Outsourcing influences both the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) and the CM's production levels, and, therefore, through learning-by-doing renders future costs dependent on past outsourcing decisions. As such, outsourcing should not be viewed as a static decision that, once made, is not revisited. We address these considerations by analyzing a two-period game between an OEM and a powerful CM wherein both firms can reduce their production costs through learning-by-doing. We find that partial outsourcing, wherein the OEM simultaneously outsources and produces in-house, can be an optimal strategy. Also, we find that the OEM's outsourcing strategy may be dynamic-i.e., change from period to period. In addition, we find both that the OEM may engage in production for leverage (i.e., produce internally when at a cost disadvantage) and that the CM may engage in low balling. These and other findings in this paper demonstrate the importance of considering learning, the power of the CM, and future periods when making outsourcing decisions.

User requests are assumed to arrive following a Poisson process and a binomial distribution is used to model duplication of requests. We obtain expressions for expected queue lengths with an exponential server using an N-policy for an integer N >= 1. We also obtain the optimal batching size and mean service rate by minimizing the total cost consisting of the cost of the server, the cost of waiting, and the fixed cost of maintenance, if applicable.

A Continuous-Review Inventory Model with Disruptions at Both Supplier and Retailer	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						inventory model; supply disruptions; safety stock	EOQ MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; RISKS; CHAIN	We consider a continuous-review inventory problem for a retailer who faces random disruptions both internally and externally (from its supplier). We formulate the expected inventory cost at this retailer and analyze the properties of the cost function. In particular, we show that the cost function is quasi-convex and therefore can be efficiently optimized to numerically find the optimal order size from the retailer to the supplier. Computational experiments provide additional insight into the problem. In addition, we introduce an effective approximation of the cost function. Our approximation can be solved in closed form, which is useful when the model is embedded into more complicated supply chain design or management models.

J	Chung, WM; Swink, M				Chung, Wenming; Swink, Morgan			Patterns of Advanced Manufacturing Technology Utilization and Manufacturing Capabilities	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Advanced Manufacturing Technologies; taxonomy; manufacturing capabilities	COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; TRADE-OFFS; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; FLEXIBILITY; TAXONOMY; INTEGRATION	The objectives of this research are first to empirically replicate Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) utilization taxonomies identified in foregoing research, second to investigate the relationship between patterns of AMT utilization and manufacturing capabilities attainment, and third to explore differences in context, and performance across AMT groups. Theories of performance frontiers and capability progression provide the basis for our hypotheses. Data were collected from 224 U.S. manufacturing plants in industries considered to have potential utilizations of AMTs. A cluster analysis of the data yields a solution that closely resembles a previous AMT utilization taxonomy, including four groups labeled, respectively, as Traditionalists, Generalists, High Investors, and Designers. Significant manufacturing capability differences across these four groups indicate that plants that utilize a broader scope of AMTs enjoy a greater breadth of manufacturing capabilities. The implied capability attainment pattern is consistent with cumulative capability theory. However, the results suggest that cost capability is not included in the capability mix when broad-based AMT utilization is the enabler of capability gains. A post hoc exploration of the AMT groups indicates significant differences in performance across the groups. Collectively, the results extend prior research by providing added insights into the possible rationale and impact of AMT utilization patterns.

Optimal Ordering Policies for Stochastic Inventory Problems with Observed Information Delays	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						destination and origin determined dynamic delays; information flow crossing; stochastic inventory control; base-stock policies	SYSTEMS; MODELS	Information delays exist in an inventory system when it takes time to collect, process, validate, and transmit inventory/demand data. A general framework is developed in this paper to describe information flows in an inventory system with information delays. We characterize the sufficient statistics for making optimal decisions. When the ordering cost is linear, the optimality of a state-dependent base-stock policy is established even when information flows are allowed to cross over time. Additional insights into the problem are obtained via a comparison between our models and the models with stochastic order lead times. We also show that inventory can substitute for information and vice versa.

J	Bala, R; Carr, S				Bala, Ram; Carr, Scott			Pricing Software Upgrades: The Role of Product Improvement and User Costs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing; market segmentation; upgrades; software industry	DURABLE-GOODS MONOPOLISTS; INFORMATION GOODS	The computer software industry is an extreme example of rapid new product introduction. However, many consumers are sophisticated enough to anticipate the availability of upgrades in the future. This creates the possibility that consumers might either postpone purchase or buy early on and never upgrade. In response, many software producers offer special upgrade pricing to old customers in order to mitigate the effects of strategic consumer behavior. We analyze the optimality of upgrade pricing by characterizing the relationship between magnitude of product improvement and the equilibrium pricing structure, particularly in the context of user upgrade costs. This upgrade cost (such as the cost of upgrading complementary hardware or drivers) is incurred by the user when she buys the new version but is not captured by the upgrade price for the software. Our approach is to formulate a game theoretic model where consumers can look ahead and anticipate prices and product qualities while the firm can offer special upgrade pricing. We classify upgrades as minor, moderate or large based on the primitive parameters. We find that at sufficiently large user costs, upgrade pricing is an effective tool for minor and large upgrades but not moderate upgrades. Thus, upgrade pricing is suboptimal for the firm for a middle range of product improvement. User upgrade costs have both direct and indirect effects on the pricing decision. The indirect effect arises because the upgrade cost is a critical factor in determining whether all old consumers would upgrade to a new product or not, and this further alters the product improvement threshold at which special upgrade pricing becomes optimal. Finally, we also analyze the impact of upgrade pricing on the total coverage of the market.

J	Su, XM				Su, Xuanming			A Model of Consumer Inertia with Applications to Dynamic Pricing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inertia; behavioral decision-making; dynamic pricing; customer behavior	PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FUNCTION; STRATEGIC CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; VARIETY-SEEKING; SELF-CONTROL; PROSPECT-THEORY; CHOICE; PSYCHOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; PROCRASTINATION; PERFORMANCE	This paper introduces a decision model of consumer inertia. Consumers exhibit inertia when they have an inherent bias to delay purchases. Inertia may induce consumers to wait even when it is optimal to buy immediately. We embed our decision model within a dynamic pricing context. There is a firm that sells a fixed capacity over two time periods to an uncertain number of both rational and inertial consumers. We find that consumer inertia has both positive and negative effects on profits: it decreases demand (in period one) but intensifies competition among consumers for the product (in period two). We show that our model of inertia is consistent with well-established behavioral regularities, such as loss aversion and probability weighting in the sense of prospect theory, and hyperbolic time preferences. We offer practical recommendations for firms to influence the level of consumer inertia. These include offering returns policies (to mitigate potential consumer losses), providing decision aids (to avoid perception errors), and offering flexible payment options (to lower transaction costs).

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						retailing; reservation; contingent sales; callable products; revenue management	DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; REVENUE MANAGEMENT; PRICE; CAPACITY; CONSUMERS; PRODUCTS; AUCTIONS	This paper considers the sale of a seasonal product in the face of strategic customers. At the beginning of the selling season, the retailer announces both the price p(h) at which the product will be sold during the selling season and the post-season clearance price p(l) < p(h) for unsold items. We analyze two operating regimes: The "no reservation regime'' allows a buyer either to purchase the product at price ph when he arrives or to enter a lottery to purchase at price p(l) if the product remains unsold. The "reservation regime'' offers each buyer one extra option than the no reservation regime: reserve the product for purchase at the clearance price p(l). If the buyer reserves the product under the reservation regime and if it remains unsold at the end of the selling season, then he is obligated to purchase it at price p(l). We consider a situation in which heterogeneous customers with probabilistic valuation arrive in accord with a Poisson process. We characterize the rational purchasing behavior wherein each arriving customer is strategic; each customer takes other customers' purchasing behavior into consideration. By considering the Nash equilibrium of this game, we show that strategic customer behavior can render the customer to be worse off and the retailer to be better off under the reservation regime, despite the fact that this regime offers one extra option (reservation) to a customer. Hence, more purchasing options do not necessarily benefit customers.

J	Tilson, V; Wang, YZ; Yang, W				Tilson, Vera; Wang, Yunzeng; Yang, Wei			Channel Strategies for Durable Goods: Coexistence of Selling and Leasing to Individual and Corporate Consumers	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						channels of distribution; selling and leasing; durable goods; game theory; market segmentation	MONOPOLY	In durable goods markets, such as those for automobiles or computers, the coexistence of selling and leasing is common as is the existence of both corporate and individual consumers. Leases to corporate consumers affect the price of used goods on the second-hand market which in turn affect the buying and leasing behavior of individual consumers. The setting of prices (or volumes) for sale and lease to individual and corporate consumers is a complicated problem for manufacturers. We consider a manufacturer who concurrently sells and leases a finitely durable good to both individual and corporate consumers. The interaction between the manufacturer and consumers is modeled as a dynamic sequential game, where each player seeks to maximize its own payoff over an infinite horizon. We study how the corporate channel substitutability of new goods and used goods and transaction costs in the second-hand market affect the manufacturer's pricing decisions, consumer behavior, and social welfare in the retail market. Making a number of simplifying assumptions, including two-period lifetime for the finitely durable goods, we consider Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the solution concept. We show that the manufacturer can maximize her profit by segmenting consumers according to their willingness to pay. Selling and leasing are the mechanisms used for price discrimination in the retail market. We show that as she leases a larger share of her production to the corporate consumer, (1) the manufacturer does not necessarily have to adjust the optimal selling price of new goods to individual consumers, and the volume of sales of new goods to individual consumers can stay the same; (2) the manufacturer does increase the retail lease price, and the number of individual leases decreases; (3) the net supply of used goods on the market increases, leading to a lower market price for used goods; and (4) more individual consumers are able to participate in the market, and their collective welfare or net utility improves. We also show that as production costs increase the manufacturer increases prices, reducing volumes across all channels. When transaction costs increase, the manufacturer reduces leasing in both corporate and retail channels.

Static and Dynamic Pricing of Excess Capacity in a Make-to-Order Environment	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing; revenue management; make-to-order; queueing; dynamic control	PRODUCTION DECISIONS; SERVICE FACILITY; INVENTORY DECISIONS; STOCHASTIC DEMAND; NETWORK; QUEUES; UNCERTAINTY; MONOPOLIST; STRATEGIES; STABILITY	We consider a make-to-order manufacturer that serves two customer classes: core customers who pay a fixed negotiated price, and "fill-in'' customers who make submittal decisions based on the current price set by the firm. Using a Markovian queueing model, we determine how much the firm can gain by explicitly accounting for the status of its production facility in making pricing decisions. Specifically, we examine three pricing policies: (1) static, state-independent pricing, (2) constant pricing up to a cutoff state, and (3) general state-dependent pricing. We determine properties of each policy, and illustrate numerically the financial gains that the firm can achieve by following each policy as compared with simpler policies. Our main result is that constant pricing up to a cutoff state can dramatically outperform a state-independent policy, while at the same time achieving most of the increase in revenue achievable from general state-dependent pricing. Thus, we find that constant pricing up to a cutoff state presents an attractive tradeoff between ease of implementation and revenue gain. When the costs of policy design and implementation are taken into account, this simple heuristic may actually out-perform general state-dependent pricing in some settings.

Optimal Pricing and Rebate Strategies in a Two-Level Supply Chain	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						marketing/operations interface; promotion; rebate; supply chain management; vertical competition	MANUFACTURER TRADE DEALS; PROMOTIONAL STRATEGIES; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; COORDINATION; RETAILER; IMPACT; SALES; MODEL	For many product categories, manufacturers and retailers often offer rebates to stimulate sales. Due to certain adverse effects, however, some manufacturers and retailers are contemplating the elimination of their rebate programs. This paper sheds light on the debate about the value of rebate programs by presenting a model for evaluating the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in a competitive environment. Specifically, we consider a two-level supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. Each firm makes three decisions: the regular (wholesale or retail) price, whether or not to offer rebates, and the rebate value should the firm decide to launch a rebate program. We determine the equilibrium of a vertical competition game between the manufacturer (leader) and the retailer (follower), and we provide insights about how competition affects the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in equilibrium.

J	Klassen, KJ; Yoogalingam, R				Klassen, Kenneth J.; Yoogalingam, Reena			Improving Performance in Outpatient Appointment Services with a Simulation Optimization Approach	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						appointment scheduling; outpatient services; simulation optimization	MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; SINGLE-SERVER SYSTEM; SCHEDULING ARRIVALS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CUSTOMER ARRIVALS; SCATTER SEARCH; TIMES; MODELS; PRESCRIPTION; POLICIES	Outpatient health care service providers face increasing pressure to improve the quality of their service through effective scheduling of appointments. In this paper, a simulation optimization approach is used to determine optimal rules for a stochastic appointment scheduling problem. This approach allows for the consideration of more variables and factors in modeling this system than in prior studies, providing more flexibility in setting policy under various problem settings and environmental factors. Results show that the dome scheduling rule proposed in prior literature is robust, but practitioners could benefit from considering a flatter, "plateau-dome.'' The plateau-dome scheduling pattern is shown to be robust over many different performance measures and scenarios. Furthermore, because this is the first application of simulation optimization to appointment scheduling, other insights are gleaned that were not possible with prior methodologies.

Sourcing Decisions with Stochastic Supplier Reliability and Stochastic Demand	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sourcing; supplier selection; supply chain management	INVENTORY MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSIFICATION; YIELD; LONG	Supplier sourcing strategies are a crucial factor driving supply chain success. In this paper, we investigate the implications of uncertain supplier reliability on a firm's sourcing decisions in an environment with stochastic demand. In particular, we characterize specific conditions under which a firm should choose a single versus multiple supplier sourcing strategy. In an environment with both uncertain demand and supply, we characterize the total order quantity, the number of suppliers selected for order placement, and the allocation of the total order quantity among these selected suppliers. For deeper managerial insight, we also examine the sensitivity of the optimal sourcing decisions to interactions between uncertainties in product demand and supply reliability. We show that sourcing from a single supplier is an optimal strategy for environments characterized by high levels of demand uncertainty or high salvage values. A numerical analysis based on data obtained from an office products retailer further reinforces our analytical results. In addition, we also find that when minimal order quantities are imposed, there are situations where it is not optimal to place an order with the lowest cost supplier.

Such regulation puts an economic burden on firms, while creating fairness concerns and potentially even missing its primary target: environmental benefits. This research discusses the economic and environmental impacts of extended producer responsibility type of legislation and identifies efficiency conditions. It is shown that the right policy would (i) make producers responsible for their own waste to avoid fairness concerns and (ii) favor eco-design producers to create stronger environmental benefits. Furthermore, the efficiency of take-back systems is also driven by environmental classification of products, industry structure, and end-user willingness to participate in take-back programs.

In this paper, we examine the influence of EPR policy parameters on product design and coordination incentives in a durable product supply chain. We model a manufacturer supplying a remanufacturable product to a customer over multiple periods. The manufacturer invests in two design attributes of the product that impact costs incurred by the supply chain-performance, which affects the environmental impact of the product during use, and remanufacturability, which affects the environmental impact post-use. Consistent with the goals of EPR policies, the manufacturer and the customer are required to share the environmental costs incurred over the product's life cycle. The customer has a continuing need for the services of the product and optimizes between the costs of product replacement and the costs incurred during use. We demonstrate how charges during use and post-use can be used as levers to encourage environmentally favorable product design. We analyze the impact of supply chain coordination on design choices and profit and discuss contracts that can be used to achieve coordination, both under symmetric and asymmetric information about customer attributes.

J	Pagell, M; Gobeli, D				Pagell, Mark; Gobeli, David			How Plant Managers' Experiences and Attitudes Toward Sustainability Relate to Operational Performance	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainable operations management; employee well-being; the natural environment; secondary measures of performance; qualitative data	RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVE; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE; SAFETY; MODEL; DISCRETION; STRATEGY; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; IMPACT	Managers are increasingly faced with pressure to think not just about profits, but also about their organization's environmental and social performance. This research provides a first examination of operational managers' experiences with and attitudes about employee well-being and environmental issues, how these factors impact employee well-being and environmental performance, and how the three performance measures interrelate. We use violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations and Toxic Release Inventory reports of emissions as proxies for employee well-being and environmental performance. Our findings suggest that operational managers do not (yet) think in sustainability terms. However, employee well-being and environmental performance do interact in a significant way with operational performance. Hence, operational managers would benefit from a more complete understanding of the relationships among the elements of the triple bottom line.

The Value of Quality Grading in Remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; production planning; quality grading		In this paper we consider a tactical production-planning problem for remanufacturing when returns have different quality levels. Remanufacturing cost increases as the quality level decreases, and any unused returns may be salvaged at a value that increases with their quality level. Decision variables include the amount to remanufacture each period for each return quality level and the amount of inventory to carry over for future periods for both returns (unremanufactured), and finished remanufactured products. Our model is grounded with data collected at Pitney-Bowes from their mailing systems remanufacturing operations. We derive some analytic properties for the optimal solution in the general case, and provide a simple greedy heuristic to computing the optimal solution in the case of deterministic returns and demand. Under mild assumptions, we find that the firm always remanufactures the exact demand in each period. We also study the value of a nominal quality-grading system in planning production. Based on common industry parameters, we analyze, via a numerical study, the increase in profits observed by the firm if it maintains separate inventories for each quality grade. The results show that a grading system increases profit by an average of 4% over a wide range of parameter values commonly found in the remanufacturing industry; this number increases as the returns volume increases. We also numerically explore the case where there are capacity constraints and find the average improvement of a grading system remains around 4%.

Our key results are as follows: (i) Variable costs drive vertical differentiation. In the presence of significant volume-dependent manufacturing costs, the optimal portfolio contains a mix of vertically and horizontally differentiated products and an increase in the variable cost makes adding vertically differentiated products relatively more profitable; if fixed volume-independent design costs dominate, the portfolio exhibits solely horizontal differentiation. (ii) Horizontal differentiation is the main profit lever, and vertical differentiation brings only a marginal benefit; this is true even when most of the consumers exhibit low willingness to pay for performance, which is often used as an excuse to offer low-end products. (iii) There are more low-quality products than high-quality ones, and market coverage increases when the willingness to pay for performance increases. In summary, the model shows how portfolio composition decisions depend on the product cost structure and the consumer preferences.

Impact of Absenteeism on Assembly Line Quality and Throughput	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						work team; Andon; automotive; queueing		Assembly lines function best when every worker is present. When a worker is absent, management must scramble to quickly find a replacement. Usually, the replacement will not be as proficient as the absent worker. This can reduce quality and throughput. We present two assembly line work-systems models (one for lines with Andon and one for lines without Andon) that show one mechanism whereby absenteeism could impact quality and throughput. We exercise these models to provide insights into absenteeism's impact on quality and throughput. While the paper is written in the concrete terms of automotive assembly, the concepts and results apply to manual assembly lines in general.

Optimal Pricing, Ordering, and Return Policies for Consumer Goods	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product returns; inventory management; pricing	RESALABLE RETURNS; PRODUCT QUALITY; NEWSBOY PROBLEM; SUPPLY CHAIN; CHOICE; DECISIONS; MODEL	Our research addresses a firm that sells a product to consumers who are sensitive to both price and return policy. The operational decisions of interest are the selling price, return policy, and quantity of new product to purchase. We model a single selling season that is split into two periods where the boundary between periods is delineated by the opportunity to recover product returns and resell them. That is, returns in the first period can be recovered and sold in the second period. Returns also arise in the second period, but these may only be salvaged. We first analyze both deterministic and stochastic models, finding that the deterministic results largely carry over to the stochastic case. In addition, our results indicate that the model is quite insensitive to errors in the estimates of the parameter values, except for purchase cost and parameters related to demand. Finally, we perform an analysis on the value of various investments to improve financial performance. Results indicate that investments to reduce the recovery cost of returns or reduce returns uncertainty are minimal, while investments to increase recovery speed, reduce market uncertainty, and reduce the return rate can be quite valuable.

Melons and other types of produce reach their peak value at the time of harvest; product value deteriorates exponentially post-harvest until the product is cooled to dampen the deterioration. Using the product's marginal value of time (MVT), the rate at which the product loses value over time in the supply chain, we show that the appropriate model to minimize lost value in the supply chain is a hybrid of a responsive model from post-harvest to cooling, followed by an efficient model in the remainder of the chain. We also show that these two segments of the supply chain are only loosely linked, implying that little coordination is required across the chain to achieve value maximization. The models we develop also provide insights into the use of a product's MVT to develop supply chain strategies for other perishable products.

J	Oliva, R; Watson, N				Oliva, Rogelio; Watson, Noel			Managing Functional Biases in Organizational Forecasts: A Case Study of Consensus Forecasting in Supply Chain Planning	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						forecasting; marketing; operations interface; sales and operations planning; organizational issues; case; field study	JUDGMENTAL FORECASTS; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; CONTINGENCY-MODEL; SERVICE INDUSTRY/; ACCURACY; SALES; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; ADJUSTMENT; MANAGEMENT	To date, little research has been done on managing the organizational and political dimensions of generating and improving forecasts in corporate settings. We examine the implementation of a supply chain planning process at a consumer electronics company, concentrating on the forecasting approach around which the process revolves. Our analysis focuses on the forecasting process and how it mediates and accommodates the functional biases that can impair the forecast accuracy. We categorize the sources of functional bias into intentional, driven by misalignment of incentives and the disposition of power within the organization, and unintentional, resulting from informational and procedural blind spots. We show that the forecasting process, together with the supporting mechanisms of information exchange and elicitation of assumptions, is capable of managing the potential political conflict and the informational and procedural shortcomings. We also show that the creation of an independent group responsible for managing the forecasting process, an approach that we distinguish from generating forecasts directly, can stabilize the political dimension sufficiently to enable process improvement to be steered. Finally, we find that while a coordination system-the relevant processes, roles and responsibilities, and structure-can be designed to address existing individual and functional biases in the organization, the new coordination system will in turn generate new individual and functional biases. The introduced framework of functional biases (whether those biases are intentional or not), the analysis of the political dimension of the forecasting process, and the idea of a coordination system are new constructs to better understand the interface between operations management and other functions.

J	Mishra, BK; Raghunathan, S; Yue, XH				Mishra, Birendra K.; Raghunathan, Srinivasan; Yue, Xiaohang			Demand Forecast Sharing in Supply Chains	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information sharing; supply chain; pricing; inventory	INFORMATION ACQUISITION; INCENTIVES; DISTORTION; COURNOT	This paper examines the incentives of a manufacturer and a retailer to share their demand forecasts. The demand at the retailer is a linearly decreasing function of price. The manufacturer sets the wholesale price first, and the retailer sets the retail price after observing the wholesale price. Both players set their prices based on their forecasts of demand. In the make-to-order scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity after observing the actual demand; in the make-to-stock scenario, the manufacturer sets the production quantity before the demand is realized. In the make-to-order scenario, we show that sharing the forecast unconditionally by the retailer with the manufacturer benefits the manufacturer but hurts the retailer. We also demonstrate that a side payment contract cannot induce Pareto-optimal information sharing equilibrium, but a discount based wholesale price contract can. The social welfare as well as consumer surplus is higher under the discount contract, compared with under no information sharing. In the make-to-stock scenario, the manufacturer realizes additional benefits in the form of savings in inventory holding and shortage costs when forecasts are shared. If the savings from inventory holding and shortage costs because of information sharing are sufficiently high, then a side payment contract that induces Pareto-optimal information sharing is feasible in the make-to-stock scenario. We also provide additional managerial insights with the help of a computational study.

J	Thomas, DJ; Warsing, DP; Zhang, XY				Thomas, Douglas J.; Warsing, Donald P.; Zhang, Xueyi			Forecast Updating and Supplier Coordination for Complementary Component Purchases	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply contracts; forecast updating; production outsourcing	STYLE-GOODS; ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS; RANDOM DEMAND; EARLY SALES; DECISIONS; CONTRACTS; CHAIN; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; REVISIONS	We study a supply chain where an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) buys subassemblies, comprised of two complementary sets of components, from a contract manufacturer (CM). The OEM provides a demand forecast at the time when the CM must order the long lead-time set of components, but must decide whether or not to provide updated forecasts as a matter of practice. Forecast updates affect the CM's short lead-time purchase decision, and the anticipation of updates may also affect the long lead-time purchase decision. While the OEM and CM both incur lost sales costs, the OEM can decide whether or not to share the overage costs otherwise fully borne by the CM. We investigate when the OEM is better served by committing to provide updated forecasts and/or committing to share overage costs. For a distribution-free, two-stage forecast-update model, we show that (1) the practice of providing forecast updates may be harmful to the OEM and (2) at the OEM's optimal levels of overage risk sharing, the CM undersupplies relative to the supply chain optimal quantity. For a specific forecast-update model, we computationally investigate conditions under which forecast updating and risk sharing are in the best interest of the OEM.

Incentive Contracts in Projects with Unforeseeable Uncertainty	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						incentives; incomplete contracts; unforeseeable uncertainty; adjustment clause	PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT; KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY; DECISION-MAKING; FAIR PROCESS; STATE-SPACE; CONTINGENCIES; INNOVATION; AMBIGUITY; JUSTICE; MODEL	Designing incentive contracts that constructively guide employee efforts is a particularly difficult challenge in novel innovation initiatives, where unforeseen events may occur. Empirical studies have observed a variety of incentive structures in innovation settings: "time and material contracts" (compensation for executing orders), "downside protection" (target-driven incentives with protection from unexpected risks), and "upside rewards" (additional remuneration for pursuing opportunities). This paper develops a model of incentives in presence of unforeseen events and offers a theoretical prediction of which of the empirically observed incentive structures should be used under which circumstances. The combination of three key influences drives the shape of the best incentive contract. First, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty, or the occurrence of events that cannot possibly be foreseen at the outset. These may force a change in the project's plan, making pure target setting insufficient. Second, fairness concerns dictate that the employee's expected compensation cannot be shifted downward by unforeseen events, because it would cause demotivation, hostility, and defection. Third, management may not be able to observe the detailed actions of the employee (moral hazard) nor whether a positive or negative unforeseen event has occurred (asymmetric information).

J	Mukhopadhyay, SK; Su, XM; Ghose, S				Mukhopadhyay, Samar K.; Su, Xuemei; Ghose, Sanjoy			Motivating Retail Marketing Effort: Optimal Contract Design	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sales agent; retail contracts; distribution channel; supply chain; game theory	SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; CHANNEL COORDINATION; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; MECHANISM DESIGN; MORAL HAZARD; SALES EFFORT; PERFORMANCE; FLEXIBILITY; INCENTIVES	We study a distribution channel where a manufacturer relies on a sales agent for selling the product, and for investing in the most appropriate marketing effort. The agent's effort is hard to monitor. In addition, the cost of effort is the agent's private information. These impose challenges to the manufacturer in its endeavor to influence the agent's marketing effort provisions and to allocate profit between the two parties. We propose two contract forms. The franchise fee contract is a two-part price schedule specifying a variable wholesale price and a fixed franchise fee. The retail price maintenance contract links the allowed retail price that the agent charges customers with total payment to the manufacturer and sales level. Under information asymmetry, for implementing either contract form, the manufacturer needs to offer a menu of contracts, hoping to invoke the "revelation principle" when the agent picks a certain contract from that menu. We show that the two contract forms perform differently, and each party's preference toward a particular contract form is linked with the total reservation profit level and/or the sales agent's cost type. We provide managerial guidelines for the manufacturer in selecting a better contract form under different conditions.

We show that one optimal policy is of the order-up-to type. Under our mean reversion and time continuity conditions, we further show that the order-up-to levels are decreasing at the current price level. At the same time, our computational study verifies that both conditions are indispensable for the monotonicity result. The study also hints at the connection between discrete- and continuous-state price processes.

This research considers a MTO manufacturer who produces a product consisting of several custom parts to be ordered from multiple suppliers. We develop procedures to allocate orders to each supplier for each custom part and calculate the associated replenishment cost as well as the probability of meeting the delivery date, based on the suppliers' jobs on hand, availability, process speed, and defective rate. For a given delivery due date, a frontier of service level and a replenishment cost frontier are created to provide a range of options to meet customer requirements. This method can be further extended to the case when the delivery due date is not fixed and the manufacturer must "crash" its delivery time to compete for customers.

In an effort to stimulate more OM research into the design, control, and management of white-collar work systems, this paper provides a systematic review of disparate streams of research relevant to understanding white-collar work from an operations perspective. Our review classifies research according to its relevance to white-collar work at individual, team, and organizational levels. By examining the literature in the context of this framework, we identify gaps in our understanding of white-collar work that suggest promising research directions.

Workload Balancing Through Recurrent Subcontracting	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subcontracting; workload balancing; recurrent decision-making; Walsh basis functions; mathematical programming	DUPLICATION	We model a situation where a firm wishes to balance workload requirements by creating a portfolio of recurrent insourcing and outsourcing contracts. We use harmonic analysis to decompose an input workload profile into a portfolio of insourcing and outsourcing contracts using rectangular-wave basis functions to better achieve some desired constant workload level. However, this initial selection of contracts may result in impractical options. Therefore, we also develop mathematical programs using principles from goal programming and integer programming to refine the portfolio of contracts to more accurately reflect a realistic environment by placing constraints on the available contracts and explicitly considering operational costs. We consider several modeling extensions including the ability to hold limited amounts of inventory and the use of one-shot contracts to supplement our portfolio of recurrent contracts.

The throughput of a bucket brigade on discrete work stations may be compromised due to blocking even if workers are sequenced from slowest to fastest. For a given work distribution on the stations we find policies that maximize the throughput of the line. When workers have very different production rates, fully cross-training the workers and sequencing them from slowest to fastest is almost always the best policy. This policy outperforms other policies for most work distributions except for some cases in which limiting the work zones of workers produces higher throughput. In environments where the work can be adjusted across stations, we identify conditions for a line to prevent blocking.

Conditional Monte Carlo Gradient Estimation in Economic Design of Control Limits	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality management; statistical process control; economic design of control charts; Monte Carlo simulation; gradient estimation	CONTROL CHARTS; SENSITIVITY	The economic approach to determining the optimal control limits of control charts requires estimating the gradient of the expected cost function. Simulation is a very general methodology for estimating the expected costs, but for estimating the gradient, straightforward finite difference estimators can be inefficient. We demonstrate an alternative approach based on smoothed perturbation analysis (SPA), also known as conditional Monte Carlo. Numerical results and consequent design insights are obtained in determining the optimal control limits for exponentially weighted moving average and Bayes charts. The results indicate that the SPA gradient estimators can be significantly more efficient than finite difference estimators, and that a simulation approach using these estimators provides a viable alternative to other numerical solution techniques for the economic design problem.

Cooperative Advertising and Pricing in a Dynamic Stochastic Supply Chain: Feedback Stackelberg Strategies	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Co-op advertising; sales-advertising dynamics; differential games; sethi model; distribution channel	PARTICIPATION RATES; COORDINATION; CHANNEL; MODEL; EXPENDITURES; CONTRACTS; DUOPOLY; EQUILIBRIA	Cooperative (co-op) advertising is an important instrument for aligning manufacturer and retailer decisions in supply chains. In this, the manufacturer announces a co-op advertising policy, i.e., a participation rate that specifies the percentage of the retailer's advertising expenditure that it will provide. In addition, it also announces the wholesale price. In response, the retailer chooses its optimal advertising and pricing policies. We model this supply chain problem as a stochastic Stackelberg differential game whose dynamics follows Sethi's stochastic sales-advertising model. We obtain the condition when offering co-op advertising is optimal for the manufacturer. We provide in feedback form the optimal advertising and pricing policies for the manufacturer and the retailer. We contrast the results with the advertising and price decisions of the vertically integrated channel, and suggest a method for coordinating the channel.

J	Lus, B; Muriel, A				Lus, Betul; Muriel, Ana			Measuring the Impact of Increased Product Substitution on Pricing and Capacity Decisions Under Linear Demand Models	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						demand modeling; product substitutability; capacity and flexibility planning; pricing	INVESTMENT STRATEGIES; FLEXIBLE RESOURCES; COMPETITION; FLEXIBILITY; TECHNOLOGIES; POSTPONEMENT; DUOPOLY; CHOICE	We consider two substitutable products and compare two alternative measures of product substitutability for linear demand functions that are commonly used in the literature. While one leads to unrealistically high prices and profits as products become more substitutable, the results obtained using the other measure are in line with intuition. Using the more appropriate measure of product substitutability, we study the optimal investment mix in flexible and dedicated capacities in both monopoly and oligopoly settings. We find that the optimal investment in manufacturing flexibility tends to decrease as the products become closer substitutes; this is because (1) pricing can be used more effectively to balance supply and demand, and (2) the gains obtained by shifting production to the more profitable product are reduced due to increased correlation between the price potentials of the substitutable products. The value of flexibility always increases with demand variability. We also show that, as long as the optimal investments in dedicated capacity for both products are positive, the optimal expected prices and production quantities do not depend on the cost of the flexible capacity. Manufacturing flexibility simply allows the firm to achieve those expected values with lower capacity, while leading to higher expected profits.

J	Bradley, JR; Guerrero, HH				Bradley, James R.; Guerrero, Hector H.			Lifetime Buy Decisions with Multiple Obsolete Parts	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						life cycle; inventory; procurement; sourcing	OBSOLESCENCE; SERVICE	Life-cycle mismatch occurs when the life cycles of parts end before the life cycles of the products in which those parts are used. Lifetime buys are one tactic for mitigating the effect of part obsolescence, where a quantity of parts is purchased for the remaining life of a product. We extend prior work that determines optimal lifetime buy quantities for one product with one obsolete part by providing an analytic solution and two simple heuristic policies for the optimal lifetime buy quantities when many parts become obsolete over a product's life cycle. We determine which of our two heuristics is most accurate for different product life cycles, which yields a metaheuristic with increased accuracy. That analysis also reveals critical perspectives in making lifetime buy decisions with nonstationary life-cycle demand patterns.
