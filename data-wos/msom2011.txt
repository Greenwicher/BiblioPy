J	Campbell, D; Frei, F				Campbell, Dennis; Frei, Frances			Market Heterogeneity and Local Capacity Decisions in Services	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; capacity; OM-accounting interface; empirical research	CUSTOMER; ORGANIZATION; COMPETITION; PROFITABILITY; CONVENIENCE; QUALITY	We empirically document factors that influence how local operating managers use discretion to balance the trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service time. Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing remanufacturing disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant. When manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are different, we develop a heuristic method for computing the near-optimal control policy that performs quite well as demonstrated numerically.

J	Zhang, D				Zhang, Dan			An Improved Dynamic Programming Decomposition Approach for Network Revenue Management	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						network revenue management; choice behavior; multinomial logit choice model; dynamic programming	CUSTOMER-CHOICE BEHAVIOR; ALLOCATION; MODEL; DIVERSION; ALGORITHM; FLIGHTS	We consider a nonlinear nonseparable functional approximation to the value function of a dynamic programming formulation for the network revenue management (RM) problem with customer choice. We propose a simultaneous dynamic programming approach to solve the resulting problem, which is a nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints. We show that our approximation leads to a tighter upper bound on optimal expected revenue than some known bounds in the literature. Our approach can be viewed as a variant of the classical dynamic programming decomposition widely used in the research and practice of network RM. The computational cost of this new decomposition approach is only slightly higher than the classical version. A numerical study shows that heuristic control policies from the decomposition consistently outperform policies from the classical decomposition.

Asymmetric Information and Economies of Scale in Service Contracting	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service outsourcing; call centers; order fulfillment operations; economies of scale; information asymmetry; screening	SUPPLY CHAIN; CALL CENTER; OPERATIONS-MANAGEMENT; INVENTORY SYSTEMS; LEVEL; QUALITY; DEMAND; POLICY	We consider outsourcing in two important service settings: call center and order fulfillment operations. An important factor in both is the inherent economies of scale. Therefore, we advance a unifying model covering both applications and study the associated contracting problem under information asymmetry. At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, "the originator," faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution.

Achieving a Long-Term Service Target with Periodic Demand Signals: A Newsvendor Framework	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor model; in-stock probability; fill rate; demand signal; service constraint; Kuhn-Tucker conditions	SERIAL INVENTORY SYSTEMS; LEVEL REQUIREMENTS; SUPPLY CHAIN; S POLICIES; FILL-RATE; MANAGEMENT; APPROXIMATION; COMMONALITY; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY	We deal with the problem of a profit-maximizing vendor selling a perishable product. At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed-one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable demand signal.

J	Liu, QA; van Ryzin, G				Liu, Qian; van Ryzin, Garrett			Strategic Capacity Rationing when Customers Learn	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						consumer behavior; pricing and revenue management; dynamic programming	FORWARD-LOOKING CONSUMERS; REFERENCE PRICE; SERVICE FACILITY; COMPETITION; INVENTORY; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR; MODELS	Consider a firm that sells products over repeated seasons, each of which includes a full-price period and a markdown period. The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates the existence of a monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one.

The success of such programs depends on well-designed and executed trade-in policies as well as accurate prediction of return flow to support operational decisions. Motivated by a real problem facing a high-tech company, this paper develops methods to segment customers and forecast product returns based on return merchandise authorization information. Noisy, yet proven to be valuable, returned quantity signals are adjusted by taking product characteristics and customer heterogeneity into account, and the resulting forecast outperforms two benchmark strategies that represent the high-tech company's current practice and a widely adopted method in the literature, respectively. In addition, our methods can serve as tools for companies to uncover the root causes of return merchandise authorization discrepancy, monitor and analyze customer behavior, design segment-specific trade-in policies, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of trade-in programs on a continuous basis.

Over the past years, retailers have increasingly relied on their leading manufacturers for recommendations regarding the assortment to be offered to the consumers in a particular category, a practice often referred to as category captainship. Our research investigates the consequences of using category captains for assortment selection decisions. We develop a game-theoretic model where multiple manufacturers sell their products to consumers through a single retailer. We compare a model where the retailer selects the assortment in the category with a model where the retailer relies on a category captain for assortment decisions in return for a target category profit. We show that category captainship can, in some circumstances, benefit not only the retailer and the category captain, but also the noncaptain manufacturers. Our results have implications regarding the implementation of category captainship practices.

Inventory Management of Platelets in Hospitals: Optimal Inventory Policy for Perishable Products with Regular and Optional Expedited Replenishments	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						perishable inventory management; dual sourcing; stochastic dynamic programming	OPTIMAL ORDERING POLICIES; SUPPLY SOURCES; SYSTEM; MODELS	Platelets are short-life blood components used in hospital blood transfusion centers. Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.

J	Tang, SY; Kouvelis, P				Tang, Sammi Yu; Kouvelis, Panos			Supplier Diversification Strategies in the Presence of Yield Uncertainty and Buyer Competition	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply uncertainty; random yield; Cournot competition; dual sourcing; equilibrium	RANDOMNESS; RISK	The benefits of supplier diversification are well established for price-taking firms. In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity-output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers.

J	Chaneton, JM; Vulcano, G				Chaneton, Juan M.; Vulcano, Gustavo			Computing Bid Prices for Revenue Management Under Customer Choice Behavior	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						stochastic gradient methods; simulation-based optimization; choice behavior; network capacity control	VIRTUAL NESTING CONTROLS; MODEL	We consider a choice-based, network revenue management (RM) problem in a setting where heterogeneous customers consider an assortment of products offered by a firm (e. g., different flight times, fare classes, and/or routes). Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems. These features make it an interesting candidate to be pursued for real-world applications.

For funders there is an increasing and pressing need to ensure that society reaps the most social benefit for their money while also developing the nonprofit sector as a whole. By routinely scrutinizing nonprofit reports in an effort to deduce whether a nonprofit organization is efficient, funders may believe that they are, in fact, giving responsibly. However, we find that these nonprofit reports are unreliable, supporting a myriad of empirical research and revealing that report-based funding methods do not facilitate efficient allocation of funds. In response, we develop audit contracts that put funders in a position to enact change. Auditing, perhaps obviously, supports funders; however, we find that it also benefits the population of nonprofits. Moreover, auditing results in improved efficiency for the nonprofit sector overall. Indeed, our conclusions indicate that nonprofits may want to work with funders to increase the use of auditing, consequently increasing efficiency for the sector overall and impacting society as a whole.

An Empirical Study of the Fast-Food Drive-Thru Industry Based on Structural Estimation Methods	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service competition; structural estimation; operations marketing interface; choice models; queueing	LOGIT-MODELS; COMPETITION; TIME; EQUILIBRIUM; OWNERSHIP; PRICES	In many service industries, companies compete with each other on the basis of the waiting time their customers experience, along with other strategic instruments such as the price they charge for their service. The objective of this paper is to conduct an empirical study of an important industry to measure to what extent waiting time performance impacts different firms' market shares and price decisions. We report on a large-scale empirical industrial organization study in which the demand equations for fast-food drive-thru restaurants in Cook County are estimated based on so-called structural estimation methods. Our results confirm the belief expressed by industry experts, that in the fast-food drive-thru industry customers trade off price and waiting time. More interestingly, our estimates indicate that consumers attribute a very high cost to the time they spend waiting.

J	Zhu, YX; Dawande, M; Sriskandarajah, C				Zhu, Yunxia; Dawande, Milind; Sriskandarajah, Chelliah			Value of Local Cash Reuse: Inventory Models for Medium-Size Depository Institutions Under the New Federal Reserve Policy	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cash supply chain; reuse of cash; cross shipping; algorithms	LOT; EXTENSIONS; DECISIONS; RETURNS	The effective local reuse of physical cash by depository institutions (DIs) is the primary goal of the new cash recirculation policy of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) of the United States. These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of cross shipping, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to-and withdrawal of fit cash from-the Fed; and (ii) offering a custodial inventory program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models-designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI-that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed-based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider-helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the Value of Local Reuse for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.

J	Bisi, A; Dada, M; Tokdar, S				Bisi, Arnab; Dada, Maqbool; Tokdar, Surya			A Censored-Data Multiperiod Inventory Problem with Newsvendor Demand Distributions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory; stochastic demand; lost sales; scalability; optimal policy	UNOBSERVED LOST SALES; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT	We study the stochastic multiperiod inventory problem in which demand in excess of available inventory is lost and unobserved so that demand data are censored. A Bayesian scheme is employed to dynamically update the demand distribution for the problem with storable or perishable inventory and with exogenous or endogenous price. We show that the Weibull is the only newsvendor distribution for which the optimal solution can be expressed in scalable form. Moreover, for Weibull demand the cost function is not convex in general. Nevertheless, in all but the storable case, sufficient structure can be discerned so that the optimal solution can be easily computed. Specifically, for the perishable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found by solving simple recursions, whereas the perishable case with pricing requires solutions to more complex one-step look-ahead recursions. Interestingly, for the special case of exponential demand the cost function is convex, so that for the storable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found using simple one-step look-ahead recursions whereas for the perishable case the optimal policy can be expressed by exact closed-form formulas.

We study how informing customers about their anticipated delays affects performance. Customers react by balking upon hearing the delay announcement and may subsequently renege, particularly if the realized waiting time exceeds the delay that has originally been announced to them. The balking and reneging from such a system are a function of the delay announcement. Modeling the call center as an M/M/s+M queue with endogenized customer reactions to announcements, we analytically characterize performance measures for this model. The analysis allows us to explore the role announcing different percentiles of the waiting time distribution, i.e., announcement coverage, plays on subsequent performance in terms of balking and reneging. Through a numerical study, we explore when informing customers about delays is beneficial and what the optimal coverage should be in these announcements. We show how managers of a call center with delay announcements can control the trade-off between balking and reneging through their choice of announcements to be made.

We prove that concavity of the total profit function with respect to market share holds even when price sensitivity may vary with products. We use this result to analytically compare the optimal monopoly solution to oligopolistic equilibrium solutions. To demonstrate further applications of the concavity result, we consider several multiperiod dynamic models that incorporate the pricing of multiple products in the context of inventory control and revenue management, and establish structural results of the optimal policies.

We study the optimal decisions for both a price-taking and a price-setting newsvendor when the advertiser has private information about its willingness to pay for advertisements. We find that the newsvendor's optimal policy excludes advertisers with low willingness to pay and distorts the price and quantity from its system-efficient level to screen the advertiser. Our analysis reveals the different roles that pricing and production quantity play as screening instruments. We perform a numerical analysis to investigate the value of information and the impact of the model parameters.

In this paper, we consider a repeated newsvendor setting where this is not the case and study the problem of setting inventory targets when there is a limited amount of historical demand data. Consequently, we achieve the following objectives: (1) to quantify the inaccuracy in the inventory-target estimation as a function of the length of the historical demand data, the critical fractile, and the shape parameters of the demand distribution; and (2) to determine the inventory target that minimizes the expected cost and accounts for the uncertainty around the demand parameters estimated from limited historical data. We achieve these objectives by using the concept of expected total operating cost and representing the demand distribution with the highly flexible Johnson translation system. Our procedures require no restrictive assumptions about the first four moments of the demand random variables, and they can be easily implemented in practical settings with reduced expected total operating costs.

Fluid Tasks and Fluid Teams: The Impact of Diversity in Experience and Team Familiarity on Team Performance	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						diversity; knowledge work; project flexibility; task change; team familiarity	DEEP-LEVEL DIVERSITY; WORK GROUP DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; RELATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MEMBER FAMILIARITY; TRANSACTIVE MEMORY; KNOWLEDGE	In this paper, we consider how the structures of tasks and teams interact to affect team performance. We study the effects of diversity in experience on a team's ability to respond to task changes by separately examining interpersonal team diversity (i.e., differences in experience across the entire team) and intrapersonal team diversity (i.e., whether individuals on the team are more or less specialized). We also examine whether team familiarity-team members' prior experience working with one another-helps teams to better manage challenges created by task changes and greater interpersonal team diversity. Using detailed project-and individual-level data from an Indian software services firm, we find that the interaction of task change with intrapersonal diversity is related to improved project performance, whereas the interaction of task change with interpersonal diversity is related to diminished performance. Additionally, the interaction of team familiarity with interpersonal diversity is related to improved project performance in some cases. Our results highlight a need for more nuanced approaches to leveraging experience in team management.

Herding in Queues with Waiting Costs: Rationality and Regret	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						herd behavior; queueing games; learning; regret; bounded rationality	BIMATRIX GAMES; CHOICE; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	We study how consumers with waiting cost disutility choose between two congested services of unknown service value. Consumers observe an imperfect private signal indicating which service facility may provide better service value as well as the queue lengths at the service facilities before making their choice. If more consumers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at that facility and indicate higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time. We characterize the equilibrium queue-joining behavior of arriving consumers and the extent of their learning from the queue information in the presence of such positive and negative externalities. We find that when the arrival rates are low, utility-maximizing rational consumers herd and join the longer queue, ignoring any contrary private information. We show that even when consumers treat queues as independently evolving, herd behavior persists with consumers joining longer queues above a threshold queue difference. However, if the consumers seek to minimize ex post regret when making their decisions, herd behavior may be dampened.

J	Kumar, A; Telang, R				Kumar, Anuj; Telang, Rahul			Product Customization and Customer Service Costs: An Empirical Analysis	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product customization; product cocreation; health insurance; field study; customer service; product familiarity; call center	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; INFORMATION; VARIETY; INNOVATION; INSURANCE	We conduct a field study in a U. S. health insurance firm to examine how product customization affects the firm's cost to serve customers through its call center. In our setting, the product is a complex health insurance plan. The firm incurs substantial costs in serving the customers through its call center and in adjudicating the claims using its information systems. The firm sells either standard plans or in some instances allows customer groups to customize their plans by adding and modifying certain aspects in active collaboration with the firm. Such a collaboration process is akin to the firm cocreating products with its customers. This cocreation process should increase customers' familiarity with their coverage and improve the fit with their medical needs. Better fit and familiarity in turn, reduces customers' incentives to contact the call center for clarifications regarding the firm's product coverage. In particular, we show that customers with a customized plan call 21% less frequently than customers with a standard plan. Our results account for possible self-selection of customers to customized plans. We also show no difference in the claims adjudication cost between a standard and a customized plan exists. Overall, our results suggest customized plans may be operationally cheaper to serve than standard plans. Thus, our paper provides a link between a growing business concern (customer support cost via call centers) and a prevalent business strategy (product customization via cocreation).

J	Shao, J; Krishnan, H; McCormick, ST				Shao, Jing; Krishnan, Harish; McCormick, S. Thomas			Incentives for Transshipment in a Supply Chain with Decentralized Retailers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain incentives; transshipment; decentralized retailers; chain store retailer	2-LOCATION INVENTORY MODEL; POLICIES; PRICES	We examine transshipment incentives in a decentralized supply chain where a monopolist distributes a product through independent retailers. A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a "chain store") and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store.	[Shao, Jing; Krishnan, Harish; McCormick, S.

J	Wang, WY; Gupta, D				Wang, Wen-Ya; Gupta, Diwakar			Adaptive Appointment Systems with Patient Preferences	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						appointment scheduling; health care; probability: stochastic model applications	DISCRETE-CHOICE EXPERIMENT; PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; ADVANCED ACCESS; NO-SHOWS; REVENUE MANAGEMENT; OVERBOOKING MODEL; TIME; CONTINUITY; CUSTOMERS	Patients' satisfaction with an appointment system when they attempt to book a nonurgent appointment is affected by their ability to book with a doctor of choice and to book an appointment at a convenient time of day. For medical conditions requiring urgent attention, patients want quick access to a familiar physician. For such instances, it is important for clinics to have open slots that allow same-day (urgent) access. A major challenge when designing outpatient appointment systems is the difficulty of matching randomly arriving patients' booking requests with physicians' available slots in a manner that maximizes patients' satisfaction as well as clinics' revenues. What makes this problem difficult is that booking preferences are not tracked, may differ from one patient to another, and may change over time. This paper describes a framework for the design of the next generation of appointment systems that dynamically learn and update patients' preferences and use this information to improve booking decisions. Analytical results leading to a partial characterization of an optimal booking policy are presented. Examples show that heuristic decision rules, based on this characterization, perform well and reveal insights about trade-offs among a variety of performance metrics important to clinic managers.

Product Variety and Capacity Investments in Congested Production Systems	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity investments; flexible or dedicated facilities; statistical scale economies; product variety; product line design; vertical differentiation; segmentation	PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; LINE DESIGN; DIFFERENTIATION; CUSTOMIZATION; FLEXIBILITY; COMMONALITY; QUALITY	We investigate a firm's product line design and capacity investment problem for vertically differentiated products along design quality levels. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation of the quality level. Customers make product choices to maximize a linear utility function of price, quality level, and waiting cost. Resulting product demands are met through capacity investments in production processes, which are modeled as queuing systems. We consider two different types of production processes: product-focused, dedicated to the production of a single-product variant; and product-flexible, processing all product variants in the product line. Capacity investment and variable production costs are functions of the processed product's quality. We develop an integrated marketing-operations model that provides insights on the factors determining the right level of product variety to offer, the relative quality positioning of the products in the line, the resulting market coverage and segmentation, and the effects on production costs and congestion levels of the processes. We show that the statistical economies of scale resulting from the congestion phenomena in the production system impose limits on the optimal product variety. For product-focused processes the market size promotes a higher optimal product variety, whereas the per-unit capacity investment and customer waiting costs act as deterrents for higher product variety. For product-flexible processes optimal product variety also depends on the specific type of flexibility and the ratio of capacity investment to variable production costs.

J	Kazaz, B; Webster, S				Kazaz, Burak; Webster, Scott			The Impact of Yield-Dependent Trading Costs on Pricing and Production Planning Under Supply Uncertainty	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply uncertainty; risk aversion; yield-dependent trading costs; pricing; fruit futures	NEWSVENDOR; DEMAND	This paper studies the role of the yield-dependent trading cost structure influencing the optimal choice of the selling price and production quantity for a firm that operates under supply uncertainty in the agricultural industry. The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion.

Suppose each of several retailers observes local demand for a common item and places an order at the supplier, which is immediately filled if the supplier has the item in stock. The supplier can fill retailer orders either from their reserved inventories or from a shareable pool of inventory. Using terminology from cooperative game theory, we say that the supplier and the retailers whose orders are filled from the common pool have formed an inventory-pooling coalition and study the use of Shapley value to allocate the expected excess profit because of pooling. We find that under Shapley value allocations the retailers have incentive to join the inventory-pooling coalition, and the supplier carries the level of inventory that is optimal for the coalition. Shapley value allocations might not lie within the core of the game, but the grand coalition of all players is stable in the farsighted sense. And, although the supplier's share of the expected excess profit is largest when all the retailers participate in the inventory-pooling coalition, the allocations to the retailers may diminish as the coalition grows. Colluding against the supplier (by merging and forming larger retailers) may seem like an appealing strategy for the retailers to increase their share of the total supply chain profit, but we find that the total expected after-pooling profits of retailers may instead go down because of collusion.

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply chain structures that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i.e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may have a significant impact on the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply chain structures are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment.

We discover that the value of volume flexibility is a function of demand correlation between products, an outcome that cannot be explained by classical risk-pooling arguments. Furthermore, whereas the value of product flexibility always decreases in demand correlation, we show that the value of volume flexibility can increase or decrease in demand correlation depending on whether the products are strategic complements or substitutes. We further find that volume flexibility better combats aggregate demand uncertainty for the two products, whereas product flexibility is better at mitigating individual demand uncertainty for each product. Our results thus underscore the necessity of analyzing volume flexibility with more than one product and emphasize the contrast with product flexibility. Furthermore, we highlight the possible pitfalls of combining flexibilities: we show that although adding volume flexibility to product flexibility never hurts performance, adding product flexibility to volume flexibility is not always beneficial, even when such an addition is costless.

Regret in Overbooking and Fare-Class Allocation for Single Leg	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; worst-case analysis; regret; overbooking; fare-class allocation	AIRLINE YIELD MANAGEMENT; SEAT INVENTORY CONTROL; REVENUE MANAGEMENT; ROBUST OPTIMIZATION; MODEL; CANCELLATIONS; INFORMATION; PASSENGERS; BOOKING	Focusing on a seller's regret in not acting optimally, we develop a model of overbooking and fare-class allocation in the multifare, single-resource problem in revenue management. We derive optimal static overbooking levels and booking limits, in closed form, that minimize the maximum relative regret (i.e., maximize competitive ratio). We prove that the optimal booking limits are nested. Our work addresses a number of important issues. (i) We use partial information, which is critical because of the difficulty in forecasting fare-class demand. Demand and no-shows are characterized using interval uncertainty in our model. (ii) We make joint overbooking and fare-class allocation decisions. (iii) We obtain conservative but practical overbooking levels that improve the service quality without sacrificing profits. Using computational experiments, we benchmark our methods to existing ones and show that our model leads to effective, consistent, and robust decisions.

A unique characteristic of this problem is the return process of rented movies. We formulate this problem for new movies as a newsvendor-like problem with multiple rental opportunities for each copy. We provide demand and return forecasts at the store-day level based on comparable movies. We estimate the parameters of various demand and return models using an iterative maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Test results on data from a large movie rental firm reveal systematic underbuying of movies purchased through revenue-sharing contracts and overbuying of movies purchased through standard ( nonrevenue-sharing) ones. For the movies considered, our model estimates an increase in the average profit per title for new movies by 15.5% and 2.5% for revenue sharing and standard titles, respectively. We discuss the implications of revenue sharing on the profitability of the rental firm.

We consider a buyer facing multiple potential suppliers, each having an associated (exogenous) reliability that quantifies its risk of supply failure. We design optimal mechanisms that depend on the buyer's level of information regarding the suppliers' cost of production and reliability. When supplier reliability is known, we find that the optimal allocation resembles the allocation under full information, but with inflated production costs. When it is unknown, the same result is true when cost and reliability of a supplier are independent. Furthermore, the buyer does not have to pay any rent for information on suppliers' reliability. Moreover, we assess the benefits of the optimal mechanism compared to traditional auctions that ignore supply risk.

J	Cachon, GP; Feldman, P				Cachon, Gerard P.; Feldman, Pnina			Pricing Services Subject to Congestion: Charge Per-Use Fees or Sell Subscriptions?	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; operations strategy; pricing and revenue management; game theory; queueing theory	CLUBS; QUEUE	Should a firm charge on a per-use basis or sell subscriptions when its service experiences congestion? Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion-raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e. g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e. g., some know they are "heavy" users and others know they are "light" users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service.

Products are assembled using a combination of common and dedicated components. We characterize the optimal assortment and derive the optimal inventory levels for the common and dedicated components under various bill-of-material configurations. We investigate the effect of commonality on product variety and compare its benefits under different demand characteristics. Commonality always leads to increased profits, but its effect on the level of product variety depends on the type of commonality. If all common components are used for the production of the entire set of products, then the optimal variety level increases relative to the system with no commonality. However, if the common components are used by a subset of the final products, then the optimal variety level may decrease with commonality. We find that the effects of commonality on profit and variety level are stronger under a demand model in which product demands are more variable and exhibit pairwise negative correlation relative to a model with independent demands.
