J	Petersen, CG				Petersen, CG			An evaluation of order picking policies for mail order companies	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						order picking and fulfillment; warehousing; mail order; simulation	DESIGN	This paper is concerned with the problem of order picking in mail order companies. Order picking is the retrieval of items from their warehouse storage locations to satisfy customer orders. Five order picking policies, strict order, batch, sequential zone, batch zone, and wave, are evaluated using labor requirements, processing time, and customer service as performance measures. A simulation model was developed to investigate these picking policies in a mail order environment. Prior research has focused on the study of individual picking policies. This study extends the prior research by evaluating multiple picking policies under varying operating conditions. The results of the study seem to indicate that (1) wave picking and batch picking perform well across the range of operating conditions considered in this study, and (2) sequential zone and batch zone picking do not perform well, especially as the order volume increases. However, the benefits and drawbacks to each picking policy must be taken into account. The key to effective implementation of an order picking system is to match the firm's business strategy, capabilities, technology, and space requirements with an order picking policy that maximizes the benefits of order picking to the firm and its customers.

A simulation model of a job shop was used to test the modified SPT rule. The performance measures evaluated were mean flow time, flow time variance, and mean lateness. Conditions under which the spr modification improved results were as follows: Large number of transfer batches, small setup time to process time ratio, and large variation in process times from station to station. The results suggest that shop lending is not a significant factor affecting performance of the modified SPT rule.

J	Yang, KK				Yang, KK			Managing a flow line with Single-kanban, Dual-kanban or Conwip	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						production control systems; Single-kanban; Dual-kanban; Conwip; simulation	CONTROL MECHANISMS; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS; RULES; SHOP	To control the production of different parts on a single flow line, managers can choose between the Single-kanban, Dual-kanban, and Conwip. This paper therefore compares the three different systems. The results show that Conwip consistently produces the shortest mean customer wait time and lowest total work-in-process. Our results also contradict the finding of a previous study, which showed that Dual-kanban performed better than Single-kanban. The different findings can, however, be attributed to the use of a material transfer policy, which favors the Dual-kanban modeled in the previous study. Our study shows that transferring replenished containers immediately to downstream stations, increasing the number of cards, and reducing the withdrawal cycle reduce the mean customer wait time significantly.

In this paper, we develop a Markov decision process model that simultaneously determines maintenance and production schedules for a multiple-product, single-machine production system, accounting for the fact that equipment condition can affect the yield of different product types differently. The problem was motivated by an application in semiconductor manufacturing. After examining structural properties of the optimal policy, we compare the combined method to an approach often used in practice. In the nearly 6,000 test problems studied, the reward from the combined method was an average of more than 25 percent greater than the reward from the traditional method.

Initial results suggested that there is no relationship between the skill level of operational employees and the level of performance of the installations. When a measure of "fit" between environmental characteristics and skills was employed, however. there was a significant relationship between the fit measure and performance.

J	Andeson, EG; Fine, CH; Parker, GG				Andeson, EG; Fine, CH; Parker, GG			Upstream volatility in the supply chain: The machine tool industry as a case study	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; business cycle; manpower planning; machine tool; system dynamics	DYNAMIC DECISION-MAKING; MISPERCEPTIONS; FEEDBACK	Cyclicality is a well-known and accepted fact of life in market-driven economies. Less well known or understood, however, is the phenomenon of amplification as one looks "upstream" in the industrial supply chain. We examine the amplification phenomenon and its implications through the lens of one upstream industry that is notorious for the intensity of the business cycles it faces: the machine tool industry. Amplification of demand volatility in capital equipment supply chains, e.g., machine tools, is particularly large relative to that seen in distribution and component parts supply chains. We present a system dynamics simulation model to capture demand volatility amplification in capital supply chains. We explore the lead-time, inventory, production, productivity, and staffing implications of these dynamic forces. Several results stand out. First, volatility hurts productivity and lowers average worker experience. Second, even though machine tool builders can do little to reduce the volatility in their order streams through choice of forecast rule, a smoother forecasting policy will lead companies to retain more of their skilled work force. This retention of skilled employees is often cited as one of the advantages that European and Japanese companies have had relative to their U.S. competitors. Our results suggest some insights for supply chain design and management: downstream customers can do a great deal to reduce the volatility for upstream suppliers through their choice of order forecast rule. In particular, companies that use smoother forecasting policies tend to impose less of their own volatility upon their supply base and may consequently enjoy system-wide cost reduction.

This paper provides a review of static and deterministic flowshop scheduling research involving machine setup times. The literature is classified into four broad categories, namely sequence independent job setup times, sequence dependent job setup rimes, sequence independent family setup times, and sequence dependent family setup times. Using the suggested classification scheme, this paper organizes the flowshop scheduling literature involving setup and/or removal times and summarizes the existing research for different flowshop problem types. This review reveals that, while a considerable body of literature on this subject has been created, there still exist several potential areas worthy of further research.

We consider an F/A system that consists of an assembly station with input from K fabrication lines. Each fabrication line consists of one or more fabrication stations. The system is closed with a fixed number of items circulating between each fabrication line and the assembly station. We present algorithms to estimate the throughput and mean queue lengths of such systems with exponential processing times. We then extend our approach to analyze FIA systems with general processing time distributions. Numerical comparisons with simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our approach.	i2 Technol, Irving, TX 75039 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA	Rao, PC (reprint author), i2 Technol, Irving, TX 75039 USA.

While this problem has been addressed in the literature, the focus here is on developing simple, closed-form expressions for the order quantities. The benefit of such an approach is that the solutions are straightforward to calculate and have managerial appeal. Additionally, we show these expressions to be optimal under a variety of conditions. For more general cases when these optimality conditions do not hold, we use these expressions as heuristic solutions. Via computational studies, we demonstrate that these heuristics are extremely effective when the optimality conditions are not satisfied.

J	Hayes, RH				Hayes, RH			Toward a "new architecture" for POM	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						POMs; focus; practitioners; community		The field of POM is steadily expanding its scope. This allows us to pursue interesting new fields of inquiry and makes us ever more relevant to the needs of practitioners. But it also increases the risk that over time our efforts will become fragmented and unfocused, causing us to slowly lose our sense of community and break up into separate camps. In this paper I ask, "What kind of new organizing framework, or 'architecture,' will allow us to maintain our sense of community as our interests diverge?" I describe the experience of one academic organization that faced a similar problem several years ago and how the situation was resolved. This experience leads us to propose a possible solution to POM's emerging problem: engage with real operations managers and focus our efforts on helping them deal with the actual problems they are facing in today's complex and fast-changing world.

J	Safizadeh, MH; Ritzman, LP; Mallick, D				Safizadeh, MH; Ritzman, LP; Mallick, D			Revisiting alternative theoretical paradigms in manufacturing strategy	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing strategy; manufacturing capabilities; process choice; path dependencies	PRODUCTION COMPETENCE; PERSPECTIVE; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Testing and cross-validation of theories and paradigms are necessary to advance the field of manufacturing strategy. When the findings of one study are also obtained in other studies, using entirely different databases, we become more confident in the results. Replication alleviates concerns about spurious results and is one motivation for this study. We examine aspects of the tradeoffs concept, production competence paradigm, and a manufacturing strategy taxonomy framework. In regard to the tradeoffs concept, we found evidence of tradeoffs between some, but certainly not all, manufacturing capabilities of quality, cost, delivery, and customization. The relationships get sharper when controlling for process choice. For example, the tradeoff between cost and customization is particularly strong between plants that have different process choices. We find that such tradeoffs can changer or even disappear, however, once the process choice is in place. With respect to the production competence paradigm, our analysis shows a statistically significant correlation between production competence and operations performance in batch shops, but not in plants with other process choices, Finally, using variables similar to those of Miller and Roth, our data produced three similar clusters even though their unit of analysis was much more macro than ours. Controlling for process choice is consistent with the current manufacturing strategy literature that emphasizes dynamic development of capabilities within the context of path dependencies. A major argument of this strand of research is that operations decisions not only affect current capabilities, but also set the framework for development of capabilities in the future. That being the case, controlling for process choice (or other factors such as industry or markets) should contribute to the understanding of capability-development paths adopted by different manufacturing plants. In short, we found at least partial support for each of the theories examined here, even though the theories seem on the surface to be contradictory and mutually exclusive. Controlling for process choice or other measures of dependency goes a long way in uncovering consistency across different theories and empirical studies in operations management.

Recent studies have examined the published literature base and determined that, in general, the field has progressed beyond an exploratory stage to a point where there is a core set of basic terminology and models. Concurrent with the formation and solidification of a core terminology, there is an increasing emphasis on developing and employing a set of reliable, valid, and reproducible methods for conducting research on operations strategy. We provide a review of common methods for assessing the degree of reliability and agreement of the responses provided by multiple raters within a given organization to a set of qualitative questions. In particular, we examine four methods of determining whether there is evidence of disagreement or bias between multiple raters within a single organization in a mail survey.

We begin by exploring the various effects that a union may have in a manufacturing environment. Next, we briefly review how unions may affect managerial initiatives to reengineer processes and improve manufacturing performance. The third section analyzes an existing database to test for differences in cycle time and manufacturing performance between union and nonunion firms. Finally. we discuss the implications of the study For future operations strategy research and note how a different form of union-management relationships is beginning to evolve.

While flexible automation typically can reduce setup times, and therefore inventory carrying costs through smaller optimal batch sizes, the results of this research show that the effect of forgetting on relative cost savings is difficult to predict in some situations. When using optimal lot sizes in both the automated and labor environments. cost savings from flexible automation may be smaller than expected or may occur in different ways than anticipated.

Simulation models based on VLSI wafer fabrication facilities are utilized to test the performance of the policies. Three different criteria, namely, the average total WIP, the average backlog, and a cost function combining these measures, are used to evaluate performance. Among the policies tested, the Two-Boundary Control policy outperforms the others.

J	Kanyamibwa, F; Ord, JK				Kanyamibwa, F; Ord, JK			Economic process control under uncertainty	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						continuous quality improvement; quality control; Taguchi loss; quality costs	CONTROL CHARTS; DESIGN	The future of the global industry lies in the continuous improvement of both products and processes, a renewed commitment to competition, and an aggressive approach to satisfying customers' needs in quality. quantity, and timing. In quality management, the degree of customer satisfaction for a given product may be measured in the form of the loss to society. This loss is formulated as a function of the deviation from the target for each of the product's quality characteristics. The greater the variability of uncontrolled factors during manufacturing or production the larger will be that loss. In this paper, we develop a form of the loss function that takes into account the variability of a production process, the decision loss, and the costs of sampling and inspection. Specifically, we consider monitoring a production process, which may undergo continuous mean shift and variance deterioration during a production run. We then examine decision rules for continuing production or stopping and adjusting the production process.

J	Hanna, MD				Hanna, MD			Touring a supply chain with students: Pedagogical and practical considerations	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; quality; facility tour; pedagogy	WORK	This paper describes the supply chain tour, an expansion of the widely used facility tour pedagogy. A supply chain tour is a tour of facilities sequentially related in the creation of value that is designed to expose critical linkages and illustrate Supply Chain Management concepts and theories. Effectively using the supply chain tour pedagogy requires the instructor to create a standardized approach to managing the facility tour; a checklist is provided for this purpose. An example supply chain tour, used in the author's classes, is described.

Many schools of management and engineering are adopting integrated curricula that prepare students to design and manage the resulting complex global web of material and information flows. In this paper, we examine the curricula used by many top engineering and graduate business schools for courses in supply chain management. We present a framework for supply chain management and highlight supporting material and pedagogy. We also classify popular supply chain case studies within our framework and provide useful references to recent business press treatment of these issues.

J	Chen, FR; Samroengraja, R				Chen, FR; Samroengraja, R			The stationary beer game	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations management; supply chain management; teaching; beer game		This paper presents a variant of the popular beer game. We call the new game the stationary beer game, which models the material and information flows in a production-distribution channel serving a Stationary market where the customer demands in different periods are independent and identically distributed. Different players, who all know the demand distribution, manage the different stages of the channel. Summarizing the initial experience with the stationary beer game, the paper provides compelling reasons why this game is an effective teaching tool.

J	Anderson, EG; Morrice, DJ				Anderson, EG; Morrice, DJ			A simulation came for teaching service-oriented supply chain management: Does information sharing help managers with service capacity decisions?	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MISPERCEPTIONS; FEEDBACK	For decades, the Beer Game has taught complex principles of supply chain management in a finished good inventory supply chain. However, services typically cannot hold inventory and can only manage backlogs through capacity adjustments. We propose a simulation game designed to teach service-oriented supply chain management principles and to test whether managers use them effectively. For example, using a sample of typical student results, we determine that student managers can effectively use end-user demand information to reduce backlog and capacity adjustment costs. The game can also demonstrate the impact of demand variability and reduced capacity adjustment time and lead times.

J	Mehring, JS				Mehring, JS			A practical setting for experiential learning about supply chains: Siemens brief case game supply chain simulator	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Siemens Brief Case Game Supply Chain Simulator provides a practical setting for experiential learning exercises about supply chains. The game, drawing upon an actual situation, models the jobs of nine supply chain activities required to transform an order placed by the customer into a delivered product. Using the detail and complexity of the game, instructors can develop learning exercises that focus on a wide range of supply chain management issues. This paper describes two learning exercises with different objectives and for different audiences that we successfully delivered using the Brief Case Game. One exercise provides a concrete example of typical activities in a supply chain and their interactions. The other exercise leads students to discover what creates a need for coordination, what activities in a supply chain require coordination, and what methods work well. These exercises are suited for small upper level undergraduate and graduate courses in logistics and supply chain management. While significant resources were used to develop exercises and deliver the game, students were enthusiastic about the approach and demonstrated that they learned about the complexity inherent in managing supply chains.

The right practices can take companies to great heights; lack of attention can draw companies close to peril. In teaching supply chain management to business executives, there are four major issues that need to be highlighted: flawless execution of operations, the change from supply to demand focus, outsourcing and supply base development, and partnership implementation. This article explains these four issues, and the material that is developed at IMD to teach each of them.
