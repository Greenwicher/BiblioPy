J	Blocher, JD; Garrett, RW; Schmenner, RW				Blocher, JD; Garrett, RW; Schmenner, RW			Throughput time reduction: Taking one's medicine	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						throughput time reduction; productivity; expediting; production control		Managing throughout time and its relation to work-in-process (WIP) inventory and customer service is the focus of this paper. This research combines theory, simulation results, and the analysis of corporate data in an effort to address the issues associated with how one company (Eli Lilly) managed a reduction in their throughput times and an improvement in their delivery reliability. The results for this company suggest that production control decisions-expediting and de-expediting--can lead to a vicious circle of deicisions, which in turn can lead to increased levels of WIP inventory and higher and more unpredictable throughput times.

Our analysis confirms empirically most expected differences between process- and product-focused plants for these decisions. What is unexpected is how top-performing plants resemble other plants within the same process choice category in most respects, while distinguishing themselves on a few selected process attributes. For example. better performing process-focused plants not only achieve higher machine flexibility levels and lower overhead costs as expected, but also have more intensive preventive maintenance programs. Similarly, product-focused plants that achieve certain hallmarks of process-focused plants also enjoy superior performance.

J	Kapalka, BA; Katircioglu, K; Puterman, ML				Kapalka, BA; Katircioglu, K; Puterman, ML			Retail inventory control with lost sales, service constraints, and fractional lead times	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						(s, S) policies; Markov chains; service levels; lost sales	LEVEL CONSTRAINTS; SYSTEMS; POLICIES	This paper describes a periodic review, fixed lead time, single-product, single-facility model with random demand, lost sales and service constraints that was developed for potential application at a Western Canadian retailer. The objective of this study was to determine optimal (s, S) policies for a large number of products and locations. To this end, we evaluate the long run average cost and service level for a fixed (s, S) policy and then used a search procedure to locate an optimal policy. The search procedure: is based on an efficient updating scheme for the transition probability matrix of the underlying Markov chain, bounds on S and monotonicity assumptions on the cost and service level functions. A distinguishing feature of this model is that lead times are shorter than review periods so that the stationary analysis underlying computation of costs and sen ice levels requires subtle analyses. We compared the computed policies to those currently in use on a test bed of 420 products and found that stores currently hold inventories that are 40% to 50% higher than those recommended by our model and estimate that implementing the proposed policies for the entire system would result in significant cost savings.

The purpose is twofold. First. to help researchers focus their work on realistic problems, we exhibit the nature of randomness actually found in two industrial manufacturing systems and provide a data source for realistic probability distributions. Second, we assess the validity of two common assumptions regarding this randomness in automotive manufacturing. Many queueing network models assume that certain random variables are independent and exponentially distributed. Though often reasonable, the primary motivation for the independence and exponentiality assumptions is mathematical tractability.

The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. An iterative heuristic procedure that makes use of the network nature of the problem formulation is presented to approximate an optimal solution. An algorithm polynomial in the number of batches to produce is also presented that optimally solves the problem under special cost structures.

The model is based on an intuitive service satisfaction framework that relates three service system parameters (service success rate, complaint rate, and service recovery rate) to the percent of satisfied customers. A dynamic model is then posited that relates the defection rate and the addition rate to marker share changes. The service satisfaction/market share model yields useful insights into how market share is influenced by these service system parameters. The surprisingly simple model predicts changes in market share due to changes in customer satisfaction.

J	Soteriou, AC; Hadjinicola, GC				Soteriou, AC; Hadjinicola, GC			Resource allocation to improve service quality perceptions in multistage service systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multistage service systems; resource allocation; service quality	CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; PRODUCTION LINE; SERVQUAL SCALE; MODEL; EXPECTATIONS; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; EXTENSION; IMPACT	Service quality improvement has become an imperative in today's service firms. In this paper, we present a modeling framework that combines marketing and operations viewpoints for resource allocation. The framework can be used to allocate resources to the different stages of a multistage service system, where the manager's goal is to improve customers' perceptions of service quality, given some budget. Optimal allocation guidelines are provided, and the interplay of three factors on the resulting allocation scheme is captured. These factors are the current level of customers' perceptions of service quality at each stage, the cost of implementing a service quality improvement at each stage, and the importance placed by customers at each stage. Sensitivity analysis to provide additional managerial insights is also performed. We demonstrate the applicability of the modeling framework, using data from a real life health care environment. Model limitations and future research are also discussed.

J	Stewart, DM; Chase, RB				Stewart, DM; Chase, RB			The impact of human error on delivering service quality	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						services; quality; human error	CONSEQUENCES	This paper opens a new avenue for investigation of quality issues in services. We take the viewpoint that a substantial portion of service failures is the result of human error in the delivery process. Drawing upon the Generic Error Modeling System (GEMS) from the cognitive science literature, we develop a framework for understanding the role of human error in service failures. An empirical investigation assesses the applicability of this framework to services, identifies which error mechanisms are important sources of service failure, and clarifies how the different roles of customers and providers affect the errors made by each.

DEA is superior to many traditional methods for firms that have multiple goals. The promise of DEA is that the complex, multiobjective problem of performance measurement can be reduced to a single number. Unfortunately, the practice of DEA Often belies the promise. Misconceptions concerning the purpose and implementation of DEA Can cause DEA applications to be less than successful. Here, the technique is explained, and a guide to the implementation of DEA is proposed, utilizing DEA studies Of retail bank branches.

In complex services (e.g., health care) with multiple encounters and wide range of services, customers use some of the services rarely or only once. In such encounters, customers may not have clear expectations regarding the process and/or outcome of the impending service delivery. This may increase the likelihood of the customer to perceive poor service or be dissatisfied. Hypotheses regarding the nature of expectations-levels, uncertainty, consistency-and its affects on customer dissatisfaction are tested using a dynamic process model of customer dissatisfaction.

J	Dube, L; Johnson, MD; Renaghan, LM				Dube, L; Johnson, MD; Renaghan, LM			Adapting the QFD approach to extended service transactions	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service design; customer information; quality function deployment; extended service transactions	ADVERTISING STRATEGY	This paper proposes an adaptation of quality function deployment (QFD) fur services, more specifically extended service transactions. We propose two modifications to sen;ice applications of QFD. One is the inclusion of higher-level customer needs (consequences, benefits, experiences, and personal values) to incorporate the experiential and personal nature of extended service transactions into the process. The second modification is to use customers' knowledge and expertise regarding service production and delivery as input beyond the house of quality. An interviewing method is proposed fur a comprehensive assessment of customer needs at multiple levels. Results from an empirical application of this technique to luxury business hotels support the proposed modifications to QFD to increase its potential for application to services.

In this study, historical perspectives from which to view service typologies are provided and four decades of service typologies are chronicled. The interest in services demonstrated by academicians is tracked over time as are the purposes for which typologies have been developed. A unified schematic representation of services is developed in which the common themes underlying service typology development are identified from both a macro and micro level. Based on this study, areas for future research are identified.

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service assumptions; service characteristics; service operations management; academic view	AUTOMATION; BUSINESSES	This study empirically tests assumptions that underlie operations management (OM) scholars' belief that service operations should be managed differently. Respondents were self-classified into manufacturing and service types. There is a significant statistical difference between the views held by each group with regard to statements such as "service OM should be taught as a separate course" and "service operations should be managed differently from manufacturing." There was general consensus on the service research agenda with the exception of three research areas: time standards, technology, and productivity. The survey also revealed that customer influence has the greatest impact on service OM strategies and decisions.

The location choice in manufacturing is between integrated and independent plants, while the international choice is between a foreign and domestic plant relative to their headquarters' country. The study empirically investigates whether these choices have different plant location determinants using data from a survey of plant managers of large, multinational firms. We find more evidence that the manufacturing choices benefit from consideration of international business issues than vice versa. However, managers rank determinants associated with manufacturing strategy considerably higher than those associated with international business.

To clarify some of the important concepts, we distinguish between flexibility (ability to change states), adaptability (ability to change within a state), and efficiency (resources utilized). To illustrate such distinctions, we present a capacity expansion model that takes flexibility and adaptability into consideration. Numerical examples show how the concepts of flexibility and adaptability can be used in manufacturing.

J	Moodie, DR				Moodie, DR			Demand management: The evaluation of price and due date negotiation strategies using simulation	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						demand management; due dates		The research considers the problem of demand management in a firm where the firm's historical delivery service level reputation influences the number of quotation requests from its potential customers. Customers have a maximum and the firm has a minimum net price to due date trade off curve for each job. The demand management function bargains with the customer over price and promised due date. Bargaining finishes either with an agreed price and delivery date or with the customer refusing the firm's bid and placing the order elsewhere. The firm's objective is to maximize its long-term net revenue. The firm's demand management negotiation strategy guides this bidding process. The research demonstrates the use of simulation to test different demand management bidding and negotiation strategies for different market and firm scenarios. The demonstration uses 16 scenarios to test the different demand management negotiation strategies with a model of a classical job shop in a classical market. The investigation examines finite scheduling-based due date estimation methods, as well as the more traditional parameter-based methods. This demonstration shows that it is possible to test different bidding policies, using a simulation model of a firm and its customers, and to obtain usable results.

By leveraging the commonalities among products in a family, the decision support methodology presented in the paper helps choose components and suppliers that minimize the sum of design, procurement, and usage costs. The problem of integrated component and supplier selection is conceptualized and formulated as an integer-programming model. Analysis of the model yields two properties, complete and continuous replacement, which form the basis of a heuristic procedure. Computational tests show that the heuristic provides results close to the optimal solution and can be used for selecting components and suppliers. Application of the model to an industrial problem is discussed.

The analyses of these models have been carried out in the literature only under the assumption that unsatisfied demand is fully backlogged. The lost sales situation occurs in many retail establishments such as department stores and supermarkets. We use the analysis of the Markovian demand model with backlogging to analyze the lost sales case; in particular, we establish the optimality of an (s, S)-type policy under fairly general conditions.

The model takes into consideration return paths, Erlang distributed service times, and pull-type dispatching rule, assuming finite buffer capacities. Since it has no product-form solution and natural decomposability due to complex nontree fork-cum-join architecture and dynamic dispatching rules, we propose a machine-based decomposition algorithm for the performance evaluation of the model. Each decomposed module consists of the processing machine and its dispatching station. Three how probabilities, derived from flow conservation analysis, relate the modules, which are updated iteratively until the parameters converge. The numerical results from a real-life AGV system application show that the algorithm is reasonably accurate.

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						total quality management; quality; performance; empirical research	STRATEGY; PERSPECTIVE	In his landmark article on total quality management, Powell (1995) lamented the lack of large scale studies investigating quality management practices and performance. This study begins to fill that void using a large, random sample of manufacturing sires. The results show that quality practices can be categorized into nine dimensions. However, not all of them contribute to superior quality outcomes. "Employee commitment," "shared vision," and "customer focus" combine to yield a positive correlation with quality outcomes. Conversely, other ''hard'' quality practices, such as "benchmarking," "cellular work teams," "advanced manufacturing technologies," and "close supplier relations" do not contribute to superior quality outcomes.

Critics claim that it has little relation to TQM and is a tariff on international trade. We test the hypothesis that firms obtain ISO 9000 certification to comply with government and customer demands by estimating a probit model of the certification decision. The results support the view of proponents of no 9000. After controlling for regulatory and customer pressures to obtain ISO. 9000, other factors related to quality management and quality-based competition explain the adoption decision.

We assess the magnitude of raw materials? work-in-process, and finished goods inventories held at automotive supply plants. Inventories are shown to be jointly determined by technological and managerial factors in a manner roughly; consistent with classical inventory theory. Several categories of managerial practices are found to be important Low inventories are linked to employee problem solving and frequent communication with customers; More unexpectedly, we find the absence of inventory differences between U.S.-owned and Japanese-owned plants in North America. This contrasts with substantial differences in inventory holding between US plants and those in Japan.

We focus particularly on the tradeoff between expected work-in-process (or product leadtime) and capacity investment in job shops. We review the algorithms in the literature to derive tradeoff curves and illustrate their application in evaluating the efficiency of the system, in deciding how much capacity to have, how to allocate resources between the reduction of uncertainty and the introduction of new technologies,and how to assess the impact of changes in products throughput and product mix. The methodology is illustrated with an example derived from an actual application in the semiconductor industry.

J	Metters, R; Vargas, V				Metters, R; Vargas, V			A comparison of production scheduling policies on costs, service level, and schedule changes	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						master production scheduling; data envelopment analysis; periodic review inventory theory; simulation	POWER APPROXIMATION; SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY; DEMAND	We consider a single product, single level, stochastic master production scheduling (MPS) model where decisions are made under rolling planning horizons. Outcomes of interest are cost, service lever, and schedule stability. The subject of this research is the MPS control system: the method used in determining the amount of stock planned for production in each time period. Typically, MPS control systems utilize a single buffer stock. Here, two MPS dual-buffer stock systems are developed and tested by simulation. We extend the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology to aid in the evaluation of the simulation results, where DEA serves to increase the scope of the experimental design. Results indicate that the dual-buffer control systems outperform existing policies.

J	Boronico, JS				Boronico, JS			Reliability-constrained pricing, capacity, and quality: An illustration of economic concepts to postal services	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						postal services; pricing; reliability	GENERAL MAIL FACILITIES; DEMAND; MODEL	A model is developed from which welfare-optimal prices, capacities, and reliabilities for a Service provider are simultaneously determined. Solutions are determined under conditions of stochastic demand subject to a reliability constraint on service quality Both quality of service provided, as well as price, impact on demand for services rendered. Results indicate that (i) optimal prices; are equated to the reliabitity-constrained marginal costs,(ii) optimal reliabilities require that the marginal benefits of increasing reliability are equated to the marginal costs of doing so, and (iii) optimal capacity allocation involves minimizing the system's expected costs subject to meeting the prespecified reliability constraint for service quality. The model is applied to postal delivery services in light of the growing competition that has emerged in this industry.
