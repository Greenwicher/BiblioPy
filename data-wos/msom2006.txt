Extending the horizons: Environmental excellence as key to improving operations	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						environmental management; sustainability; quality management; supply chain management	COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; PRODUCT RECOVERY; MARKET VALUE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; QUALITY AWARDS; SUPPLY CHAINS; MANAGEMENT; GREEN; INDUSTRY; IMPACT	The view that adopting an environmental perspective on operations can lead to improved operations is in itself not novel; phrases such as "lean is green" are increasingly commonplace. The implication is that any operational system that has minimized inefficiencies is also more environmentally sustainable. However, in this paper we argue that the underlying mechanism is one of extending the horizons of analysis and that this applies to both theory and practice of operations management. We illustrate this through two principal areas of lean operations, where we identify how successive extensions of the prevailing research horizon in each area have led to major advances in theory and practice. First, in quality management, the initial emphasis on statistical quality control of individual operations was extended through total quality management to include a broader process encompassing customer requirements and suppliers' operations. More recently, the environmental perspective extended the definition of customers to stakeholders and defects to any form of waste. Second, in supply chain management, the horizon first expanded from the initial focus on optimizing inventory control with a single planner to including multiple organizations with conflicting objectives and private information. The environmental perspective draws attention to aspects such as reverse flows and end-of-life product disposal, again potentially improving the performance of the overall supply chain. In both cases, these developments were initially driven by practice, where many of the benefits of adopting an environmental perspective were unexpected. Given that these unexpected side benefits seem to recur so frequently, we refer to this phenomenon as the "law of the expected unexpected side benefits."We conclude by extrapolating from the developmental paths of total quality management and supply chain management to speculate about the future of environmental research in operations management.

J	Taylor, TA				Taylor, Terry A.			Sale timing in a supply chain: When to sell to the retailer	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply-chain contracting; pricing; sales effort; asymmetric information	STRATEGIC COMMITMENT; RETURNS POLICIES; DEMAND; INFORMATION; CONTRACTS; PRICE; COORDINATION; POSTPONEMENT; COMPETITION; DECISIONS	A fundamental decision for any manufacturer is when to sell to a downstream retailer. A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer's sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early We characterize the manufacturer's sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late. We show that the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may be hurt by the retailer's having higher-quality information.

J	Tunca, TI; Zenios, SA				Tunca, Tunay I.; Zenios, Stefanos A.			Supply auctions and relational contracts for procurement	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; procurement auctions; relational contracting; quality differentiation	TERM-CONTRACTS; REPEATED GAMES; LONG-TERM; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; MARKET; FIRM	We examine the competition between procurement auctions and long-term relational contracts that emerges from the increased usage of electronic marketplaces. Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products.

J	Etzion, H; Pinker, E; Seidmann, A				Etzion, Hila; Pinker, Edieal; Seidmann, Abraham			Analyzing the simultaneous use of auctions and posted prices for online selling	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						marketing; e-commerce; online auctions	MECHANISMS; INTERNET; ENTRY; EBAY	Many firms in the business-to-consurner market sell identical products online using auctions and posted prices at the same time. In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently. Our results suggest that unless firms jointly manage these online channels, they may find that adding auctions actually reduces their revenues.

This problem is commonly known in the location literature as the facility location problem with immobile servers, stochastic demand, and congestion. It is often set up as a network of M/M/1 queues and modeled as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (MIP). Because of the complexity of the resulting model, the current literature focuses on approximate and/or heuristic solution methods. This paper proposes a linearization based on a simple transformation and piecewise linear approximations and an exact solution method based on cutting planes. This leads to the exact solution of models with up to 100 customers, 20 potential service facilities, and 3 capacity levels.

J	Zipkin, P				Zipkin, Paul			The best things in life were free: On the technology of transactions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						transactions; RFID; technology		Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology will reduce the costs of transactions to both customers and providers. This is a good thing, mostly. But it will be harder than people suppose, and it may have some adverse consequences. There are numerous technical and policy problems, including privacy and security issues. All these likely will be resolved, but only with time, experience, and money. Thus, it is unclear just how RFID will be used, just when various applications will become feasible. Also, as transaction costs decline, providers will be inclined to charge for things that are now free, such as public parks and congested roads. We may wait less at each transaction point, but such points may proliferate. Rather than obsess about this one technology, we should aim to think creatively about transactions and ways to improve them. Transactions affect our lives in many ways. A transaction is a process, not just an event. When people are involved, the process becomes intertwined with other intricate processes-product choice, social interaction, and the expression of power relations. RFID certainly offers the potential for improvement, but there are some lower-tech methods worth considering. This is not a systematic survey, but rather an essay, a sketch in broad strokes of an immense and varied landscape. Many topics are touched on lightly. The goal is to stimulate thought and discussion. More questions are raised than answered. In places the tone is personal, some might say eccentric.

J	Corbett, CJ				Corbett, Charles J.			Global diffusion of ISO 9000 certification through supply chains	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						ISO 9000; ISO 14000; quality management; supply chains; diffusion; global; empirical; survey	PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT; ISO-14001; STANDARD	The ISO 9000 series of quality management systems standards is widely diffused, with more than 560,000 sites certified in 152 countries as of December 2003. Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement "supply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000" into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country's management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000.

Using multivariate stochastic orders, we generalize this statement to arbitrary distributions. We then describe methods to construct models with arbitrary dependence structure, using the copula of a multivariate distribution to capture the dependence between the components of a random vector. For broad classes of distributions with arbitrary marginals, we confirm that centralization or pooling of inventories is more valuable when demands are less positively dependent.

In addition, we guarantee the linear convergence rate of tatonnement. We illustrate the applicability of this approach with several examples arising from operational considerations that are often ignored in the economics literature.

Supply chain coordination for false failure returns	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						consumer returns; closed-loop supply chains; supply chain contracts	SALES QUOTAS; REMANUFACTURABLE PRODUCTS; POLICIES; FORCE; MONEY; COMPETITION; BACK	False failure returns are products that are returned by consumers to retailers with no functional or cosmetic defect. The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial.

Our objective is to gain insights into the linkage between the stages to facilitate optimal system design and decentralized system control. To this end, we develop a closed-form approximation for the optimal base-stock levels. The development consists of two key steps: (1) convert the service-constrained model into a backorder cost model by imputing an appropriate backorder cost rate, and then adapt the single-stage approximation developed for the latter, and (2) use a logistic distribution to approximate the lead-time demand distribution in the single-stage approximation obtained in (1) to yield closed-form expressions. We then use the closed-form expressions to conduct sensitivity analyses and establish qualitative properties on system design issues, such as optimal total system stock, stock positioning, and internal fill rates. The closed-form approximation and most of the qualitative properties apply equally to the model with a backorder cost, although some differences do exist. Other results of this study include a bottom-up recursive procedure to evaluate any given echelon base-stock policy and lower bounds on the optimal echelon base-stock levels.

J	Cooper, WL; Gupta, D				Cooper, William L.; Gupta, Diwakar			Stochastic comparisons in airline revenue management	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; stochastic order relations	FARE CLASSES; YIELD-MANAGEMENT; SEAT ALLOCATION; SINGLE-LEG; MODEL	Consider two markets of different sizes but similar costs and fare structure. All other things being equal, is an airline's expected revenue larger in the market with larger demand? If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis? In this article, we provide answers to these questions by studying the relationship between the optimal expected revenue and the demand distributions when the latter are comparable according to various stochastic orders. For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to "sell ups," we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.) For a problem with an arbitrary number of fare classes and independent demands, we show that stochastically larger demand distributions should be preferred. Numerical examples demonstrating the effect of parameterized demand distributions (with appropriate stochastic ordering) and dependence structures are also presented.

The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience. Convenient closed-form expressions for the overall performance as a function of model elements are derived when either the agent-retention distribution or the performance function has exponential structure. Management actions may cause the agent-retention distribution to change. The model describes the consequences of such changes on the long-run average staff experience and the long-run average performance.

J	Schwarz, LB; Ward, JE; Zhai, X				Schwarz, Leroy B.; Ward, James E.; Zhai, Xin			On the interactions between routing and inventory-management policies in a one-warehouse N-retailer distribution system	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; routing; inventory allocation; inventory replenishment	ALLOCATION; DELIVERIES	This paper examines the interactions between routing and inventory-management decisions in a two-level supply chain consisting of a cross-docking warehouse and N retailers. Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvenclor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers' inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management's ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.

J	Zhang, FQ				Zhang, Fuqiang			Competition, cooperation, and information sharing in a two-echelon assembly system	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						assembly system; decentralization; information sharing; supply chain coordination	SUPPLY CHAIN; INVENTORY POLICIES; RANDOM DEMAND; PRICE; MODEL	This paper studies a two-echelon assembly system and explores several important issues in managing decentralized supply chains. First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system's competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm's head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified. Under the transfer payment contract, the system optimal policy is the unique Nash equilibrium in the decentralized supply chain. Discussion on the relationship between our coordination scheme and existing methods in the literature is also provided.

Integrated real-time capacity and inventory allocation for reparable service parts in a two-echelon supply system	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory; periodic review; multiechelon system; real-time allocation; limited capacity; reparable service parts; priority dispatch rule; emergency shipment	SPARES STOCKING POLICIES; EMERGENCY ORDERS; SCHEDULING RULES; ITEM; APPROXIMATIONS; MODELS; REPLENISHMENT; SHOP	Two critical decisions must be made daily when managing multiechelon repair and distribution systems for service parts: (1) allocating available repair capacity among different items and (2) allocating available inventories to field stocking locations to support service operations. In many such systems, procurement lead times for service parts are lengthy and variable, repair capacity is limited, and operational requirements change frequently-resulting in demand processes that are highly uncertain and nonstationary. As a consequence, it is common to have many items in short supply while others are abundant. In such environments, integrated real-time decision-support tools can provide significant value by reducing the impact of inventory imbalances and responding appropriately to the volatile nature of the demand processes. By "integrated" and "real-time," we mean (respectively) tools that simultaneously consider key aspects of the current state of the operating environment in deciding what items to repair, where to ship available units, and by what mode to ship them. In this paper, we develop an integrated real-time model for making repair and inventory allocation decisions in a two-echelon reparable service parts system. We formulate the decision problem as a finite-horizon, periodic-review mathematical program, we show it can be formulated as a large-scale linear program, and we develop a practical heuristic method for solving the problem approximately. By simulating the operation of a service parts supply chain, we demonstrate the value of employing integrated decision models over using separate repair and inventory allocation rules for a range of environments where inventory imbalances exist.

J	Krankel, RM				Krankel, R. Mark			Timing successive product introductions with demand diffusion and stochastic technology improvement	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product innovation; uncertain technology; introduction to market	ADOPTION; MODEL; GENERATIONS; INNOVATION; MARKET; SUBSTITUTION; CONSTRAINTS; PRICE	This paper considers a firm's decisions on the introduction timing for successive product generations. We examine the case where a firm introduces multiple generations of a durable product for which demand is characterized by a demand diffusion process. Under fixed introduction costs, we consider the case where available product technology improves stochastically. As such, delaying introduction to a later date may lead to the capture of further technology improvements, potentially at the cost of slowing sales for the existing product (and a decline in market potential for the product to be introduced, given our focus on durable products). We specify a state-based model of demand diffusion and construct a decision model to solve the firm's introduction timing problem. By incorporating technology improvement in our model, we prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy governing the firm's product-introduction decisions. Numerical analysis reveals the influence of key model parameters on the pace of product introduction. Our model helps to explain the product-introduction behavior of firms and provides an alternative to previous explanations of IBM's introduction timing decisions for successive generations of its mainframe computers.

J	Maglaras, C; Meissner, J				Maglaras, Constantinos; Meissner, Joern			Dynamic pricing strategies for multiproduct revenue management problems	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; dynamic pricing; capacity controls; fluid approximations; efficient frontier	YIELD-MANAGEMENT; MODEL; ALLOCATION; BEHAVIOR; DEMAND	Consider a firm that owns a fixed capacity of a resource that is consumed in the production or delivery of multiple products. The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study. In the context of the former, we show that "resolving" the fluid heuristic achieves asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling.

We assume that the available production capacity is limited and that unmet demand is lost. We incorporate discretionary sales, when inventory may be set aside to satisfy future demand even if some present demand is lost. We analyze and compare partial planning or delayed strategies. In delayed strategies, one decision may be planned in advance, whereas a second decision is delayed until the beginning of each time period, after observing the results of previous decisions. For example, in delayed production (delayed pricing), pricing (production) is determined at the beginning of the horizon, and the production (pricing) decision is made at the beginning of each period before new customer orders are received. A special case is where a single price is chosen over the horizon. We describe policies and heuristics for the strategies based on deterministic approximations and analyze their performances. Computational analysis yields additional insights about the strategies, such as that delayed production is usually better than delayed pricing except sometimes when capacity is tight. On average, the delayed production (pricing) heuristic achieved 99.3% (99.8%) of the corresponding optimal strategy.

Performance evaluation and stock allocation in capacitated serial supply systems	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacitated supply systems; queues with planned inventories; approximations; service constraints; matrix-geometric procedure	OPTIMAL POLICIES; INVENTORY SYSTEMS; BOUNDS	We develop an approximation scheme for performance evaluation of serial supply systems when each stage operates like a single-server queue, and its planned inventories are managed according to a base-stock policy. We also present a near-exact matrix-geometric procedure for benchmarking our approximation relative to two other methods proposed in the literature. Through numerical tests, we demonstrate that our method is superior, both for performance estimation and for policy parameter optimization. Using this technique, we then perform experiments that address the following issues. What proportion of the optimal total inventory should managers allocate to upstream production stages to minimize the sum of inventory and backorder costs? If managerial action could lower holding cost rate or add capacity, which stages of the supply system should be targeted for maximum net benefit? Such concerns have been the subject of several recent studies relating to supply networks with constant and random independent lead times. We shine light on optimal actions for serial supply systems that experience congestion.

J	Muriel, A; Somasundararn, A; Zhang, YM				Muriel, Ana; Somasundararn, Anand; Zhang, Yongmei			Impact of partial manufacturing flexibility on production variability	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing capacity and flexibility planning; production variability; demand allocation; make-to-order manufacturing systems		As manufacturers in various industries evolve toward predominantly make-to-order production to better serve their customers' needs, increasing product mix flexibility emerges as a necessary strategy to provide adequate market responsiveness. However, the implications of increased flexibility on overall system performance are widely unknown. We develop analytical models and an optimization-based simulation tool to study the impact of increasing flexibility on shortages, production variability, component inventories, and order variability induced at upstream suppliers in general multiplant multiproduct make-to-order manufacturing systems. Our results show that 1. Partial flexibility leads to a considerable increase in production variability, and consequently in higher component inventory levels and upstream order variability. Although a modest increase in flexibility yields most of the sales benefits, production variability is reduced as more flexibility is added to the system. Consequently, investments in additional flexibility may be justified when component inventories are expensive, or simply by the benefits associated with the smoother production. 2. The performance of flexible systems is highly dependent on the capacity allocation policies implemented. Policies that evenly distribute product demands to the available plants lead to consistently better performance because they avoid the misplacement of inventories by replicating the performance of a single-plant system. These insights and the simulation tool can be used by practitioners to guide the design of their flexible production systems, trading off the initial capital outlay versus the sales benefits and the expected operational costs.

Product line design with component commonality and cost-reduction effort	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						component commonality; marketing-manufacturing interface; product line design	VERTICALLY DIFFERENTIATED MONOPOLY; PROCESS INNOVATION; CANNIBALIZATION; SEGMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; INVENTORY; OLIGOPOLY; QUALITY; MARKETS; VARIETY	Market pressure for low prices paired with customer demand for high product variety presents a considerable dilemma for many manufacturers. Industry practice and research to date suggest that approaches based on component commonality can substantially lower the costs of proliferated product lines, but at the cost of reducing product differentiation and revenues. We analyze a stylized model of a manufacturer who designs a product line consisting of two products for sale to two market segments with different valuations of quality. The manufacturer determines the component quality levels, the amount of effort to reduce production costs, and whether to use common or different components for the two products. Explicitly considering potential interdependencies between cost-reduction effort and quality decisions, we characterize environments where the optimal product line involving component commonality features products of higher quality and yields higher revenues. Counter to earlier research we show that it can be preferable to make those components common that, relative to their production cost, are attributed a higher importance by customers. Disregarding the interactions between commonality, production cost, quality, and effort decisions can lead manufacturers to offer product lines with excessive differentiation and inefficiently low quality.
