J	Song, YY; Ray, SB; Li, SL				Song, Yuyue; Ray, Saibal; Li, Shanling			Structural properties of buyback contracts for price-setting newsvendors	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						price-setting newsvendor; buyback contract; supply chain performance; demand curvature	RETURNS POLICIES; RETAIL COMPETITION; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY	This paper studies a buyback contract in the Stackelberg framework of a manufacturer (leader) selling to a price-setting newsvendor retailer (follower). Using an analytical model that focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous results and produce new structural insights. A novel transformation technique first enables us to establish the unimodality of the profit functions for both channel partners, under relatively mild assumptions. Further analysis identifies the necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal contract for the manufacturer (wholesale and buyback prices) is distribution free, i.e., independent of the uncertainty in customer demand. A specific instance of the above condition is also necessary and sufficient for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective. We then prove that the optimal performance of the decentralized channel for distribution-free buyback contracts depends only on the curvature of the deterministic demand part. In addition, some of the optimal decisions and relevant profit ratios for buyback contracts in our setting are shown to be identical to those for their deterministic price-only counterparts.

J	Bard, JF; Wan, L				Bard, Jonathan F.; Wan, Lin			Workforce design with movement restrictions between workstation groups	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						staff scheduling; movement restrictions; decomposition; integer programming; workstation groups	SERVICE; MODEL; SET	This paper is concerned with the problem of determining the optimal size and composition of a permanent workforce needed to run a facility when demand is specified by a workstation group (WSG) for up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For full-time employees, a solution is characterized by a bid job, which consists of a five-day-a-week schedule, a lunch break for all shifts, and a set of WSG task assignments for each of the half-hour periods in a shift. In contrast, each part-time employee may be given anywhere from one to six shifts during the week, and each shift may vary from four to eight hours in length. To facilitate supervision, all employees must be assigned to a home WSG, but when idle time exists in their schedules, they can be redeployed to other WSGs for a portion of the day. One of the complicating and unique factors addressed in this paper is the existence of nonsymmetric movement restrictions between WSGs. For example, an employee whose home base is A may be permitted to perform tasks at B, but not vice versa. Because the full problem could not be reduced to a single model, a multistage solution approach was developed. In the first stage, an extended shift-scheduling problem is solved to determine the optimal number of employees and their shifts. The results are postprocessed. in subsequent stages to obtain lunch breaks, days off, and task assignments under WSG movement restrictions. In the implementation of the multistage approach, two alternatives were explored. The first was based on the idea of partitioning the WSGs into manageable clusters and then solving them in series. The second involved the direct solution of an integer programming formulation of the task assignment problem with home-base restrictions and WSG movement restrictions, but for a fixed workforce. An iterative scheme was used to adjust the size of the workforce until all constraints were satisfied and overall optimality was achieved. Testing was done with data provided by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) mail processing and distribution center (P&DC) in Dallas. The computations showed that the second alternative always yielded the smaller workforce and was always able to find good solutions within 30 minutes.

J	Benjaafar, S; Li, YZ; Xu, DS; Elhedhli, S				Benjaafar, Saif; Li, Yanzhi; Xu, Dongsheng; Elhedhli, Samir			Demand allocation in systems with multiple inventory locations and multiple demand sources	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						production-inventory systems; optimal demand allocation; make-to-stock queues; facility location	TO-STOCK QUEUE; RENEWAL PROCESS; POINT PROCESS; POLICIES; MULTIPRODUCT; OPTIMIZATION; COMMONALITY; BENEFITS; FACILITY; MODELS	We consider the problem of allocating demand that originates from multiple sources among multiple inventory locations. Demand from each source arrives dynamically according to an independent Poisson process. The cost of fulfilling each order depends on both the source of the order and its fulfillment location. Inventory at all locations is replenished from a shared production facility with a finite production capacity and stochastic production times. Consequently, supply lead times are load dependent and affected by congestion at the production facility. Our objective is to determine an optimal demand allocation and optimal inventory levels at each location so that the sum of transportation, inventory, and backorder costs is minimized. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy. We show that the optimal demand allocations are always discrete, with demand from each source always fulfilled entirely from a single inventory location. We use this discreteness property to reformulate the problems as a mixed-integer linear program and provide an exact solution procedure. We show that this discreteness property extends to systems with other forms of supply processes. However, we also show that supply systems exist for which the property does not hold. Using numerical results, we examine the impact of different parameters and provide some managerial insights.

Therefore, its effective management must include the control of the timing of the delivery of each of the service's elements and the enhancement of the customer's experience between and during the delivery of the various elements. This paper provides a conceptual framework that links the duration of a service encounter to behaviors that have been shown to affect profitability. Analysis of the framework reveals a wide gap between the behavioral assumptions typically made in operations research (OR) and operations management (OM) models and the state of the art in the marketing and psychology literature. The central motivations behind this paper are (1) to help the OR and OM community bridge this gap by bringing to its attention recent findings from the behavioral literature that have implications for the design of queueing systems for service firms and (2) to identify opportunities for further research.

The literature only considers the issue of revenue generation in a very limited way, by allowing a job to remain unprocessed and its revenue contribution to be lost. By contrast, we consider three diverse practical situations where efficient scheduling affects revenue in much more general and realistic ways. First, we study two make-to-order environments where efficient scheduling increases customer goodwill, thus stimulating demand in different ways. Second, we study two make-to-stock environments where efficient scheduling creates inventory, thus also stimulating demand in different ways. Third, we study new product markets where efficient scheduling leads to a company becoming the first mover, and thus acquiring a larger market share. In each case, we provide both a computationally efficient algorithm for scheduling and a proof that a much more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist. For both the make-to-stock and make-to-order problems, we also describe heuristic approaches that are easy to implement, and we study their average performance. The results show that substantial benefits arise from considering the implications of efficient scheduling for revenue and net profit. The practical impact of our work is to demonstrate the importance of efficient scheduling, not only in controlling cost, but also in increasing revenue and net profit.

However, the solution of such problems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information security concerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniques to attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-en-hancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set.

In the presence of limited supply, buyers who choose to purchase at a lower price may face a scarcity in supply. Our focus is on the structure of the optimal markdown mechanisms in the presence of rational or strategic buyers who demand multiple units. We first examine a complete information setting where the set of customer valuations is known but the seller does not know the valuation of each individual customer (i.e., cannot exercise perfect price discrimination). We then generalize our analysis to an incomplete valuation information setting where customer valuations are drawn from known distributions. For both settings, we compare the seller's profit resulting from the optimal markdown mechanism and the optimal single price. We provide a number of managerial insights into designing profitable markdown mechanisms.

J	Ramachandran, K; Krishnan, V				Ramachandran, Karthik; Krishnan, V.			Design architecture and introduction timing for rapidly improving industrial products	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new product development and introduction; product architecture; modular upgraclability; rapidly improving products	DURABLE-GOODS MONOPOLISTS; DEVELOPMENT DECISION; INNOVATION; CANNIBALIZATION; TECHNOLOGIES; MODULARITY; SYSTEMS; LINE	Technological advances present firms in many industries with opportunities to substantially improve their product's capabilities in short periods of time. Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular upgradability can reduce the need for slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular upgradability and consider the implications for profits. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of product architecture with pricing and timing decisions for managing the introduction of rapidly improving products.

New research in behavioral OM is emerging to bridge the gap between traditional models and these newer observational findings. This work is both deductive and inductive, and it draws on multiple reference disciplines: experimental and behavioral economics, judgment and decision making from psychology, and organizational behavior and decision analysis from management. This special issue presents seven interesting papers that reflect the wide range of current research activity in behavioral OM. These papers provide insightful and thought-provoking introduction to this new direction in OM research.

In contrast, this paper takes a descriptive approach and considers bounded rationality, in the sense that decision makers are prone to errors and biases. Our decision model builds on the quantal choice model: While the best decision need not always be made, better decisions are made more often. We apply this framework to the classic newsvendor model and characterize the ordering decisions made by a boundedly rational decision maker. We identify systematic biases and offer insight into when overordering and underordering may occur. We also investigate the impact of these biases on several other inventory settings that have traditionally been studied using the newsvendor model as a building block, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling. We find that incorporating decision noise and optimization error yields results that are consistent with some anomalies highlighted by recent experimental findings.

Newsvendor "Pull-to-Center" Effect: Adaptive Learning in a Laboratory Experiment	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor problem; dynamic learning	LOSS AVERSION; EXPERIENCE; GAMES	In the newsvendor game, the expected-profit-maximizing order quantity is higher in the demand interval when the per-unit profit margin is high and lower in the demand interval when the per-unit profit margin is low. However, laboratory experiments show a "pull-to-center" effect: average order quantities are too low when they should be high and vice versa. We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is more likely to have been greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency.

J	Katok, E; Thomas, D; Davis, A				Katok, Elena; Thomas, Douglas; Davis, Andrew			Inventory Service-Level Agreements as Coordination Mechanisms: The Effect of Review Periods	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						service-level agreements; behavioral operations management; supply chain management; experimental economics	FILL RATE; DECISION; VARIABLES; BEHAVIOR; HORIZON; TASK	A supplier stocking goods for delivery to a retailer may face a (finite-horizon) service-level agreement (SLA). In this context, the SLA is a commitment by a supplier to achieve a minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of SLA is an important, but understudied coordination mechanism. We focus on the impact of two contract parameters: the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, whereas lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer review periods are generally more effective than shorter review periods in inducing higher stocking levels. As in several earlier laboratory studies, the explanation lies in the improved feedback reliability that longer review periods provide. The primary managerial implication of our findings is that, in practice, longer review periods may be more effective than shorter ones at inducing service improvements.

After presenting a procedure for computing optimal decision policies and some numerical results of a simple heuristic policy for the problem, we describe results from three experiments involving financially motivated subjects. The experiments reveal that decision makers employ decision policies of the same form of the optimal policy. However, they show systematic biases to demand too much when they have many units to sell and too little when they have few to sell, resulting in significant revenue losses.	[Bearden, J.

For a decision process to be seen as fair, the people affected must have the opportunity to give input and possibly to influence the decision, and the decision process and rationale must be transparent and clear. Existing research has shown empirically that fair process enhances both employee motivation and performance in execution. However, work to date has not addressed why fair process is so often violated in practice. This paper breaks new ground by analytically examining the subtle trade-offs involved. We develop a model of fair process in a principal-agent (i.e., manager-employee) context, rooted in psychological preferences for autonomy and fairness. We show that indeed fair process will not always be used, and why the hoped-for benefits may be insufficient to convince management to use fair process.

We incorporate a detailed consumer channel choice model in which the demand faced in each channel depends on the service levels of both channels as well as the consumers' valuation of the product and shopping experience. The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior. We determine that the model accurately predicts the direction of changes in the subjects' decisions, as well as their channel strategies in response to the changes in the channel environment. These observations suggest that the model can be used in designing channel strategies for an actual dual channel environment.(1).

Yet most formal analytical models of operations assume that the people who participate in operating systems are fully rational or at least can be induced to behave rationally. Many other disciplines, including economics, finance, and marketing, have successfully incorporated departures from this rationality assumption into their models and theories. In this paper, we argue that operations management scholars should do the same. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of incorporating behavioral and cognitive factors into models of operations management and suggest fruitful avenues for research in behavioral operations.

J	Aviv, Y; Pazgal, A				Aviv, Yossi; Pazgal, Amit			Optimal pricing of seasonal products in the presence of forward-looking consumers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						dynamic pricing; game theory applications; marketing-operations interface; revenue management; strategic consumer behavior	DISCRIMINATION; MANAGEMENT; MARKDOWNS; DEMAND	W e study the optimal pricing of a finite quantity of a fashion-like seasonal good in the presence of forward-looking (strategic) customers. We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic ( myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price "betting" strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20%.

J	Aydin, G; Ziya, S				Aydin, Goker; Ziya, Serhan			Pricing promotional products under upselling	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						dynamic pricing; pricing of limited inventories; cross-selling; bundling	REVENUE MANAGEMENT	Upselling is offering an additional product to a customer who just made a purchase. Most catalogers and online sellers, in addition to some traditional retailers, use upselling often to clear inventories of slow-moving items. We investigate the pricing and discounting questions for such an item, which we call the promotional product. In our model, an arriving customer may purchase this promotional product or one of the other products that the firm sells. If the customer purchases one of the other products, the promotional product is offered to the customer, possibly with a discount. While deciding whether to offer a discount and, if so, how big a discount to offer, the firm uses the information that the customer has just bought a certain product with a certain price. We investigate how discounting decisions depend on the inventory levels, time, type of pricing policy in use, and the relationship between the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product and the other products ( negatively or positively correlated). In particular, we find that if the firm sets prices and discounts dynamically and the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are negatively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then customers are always offered a discount regardless of the inventory levels and time. On the other hand, if the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are positively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then the customer may or may not be offered a discount, depending on the inventory levels and time. Our numerical study shows that the benefit to the firm from using customer purchase information is high when the firm uses a static price, but chooses discounts dynamically. We also find that although dynamic discounting decisions bring modest improvements, setting the price dynamically seems to have a more significant effect on the firm's profits.

Competitive customization	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						mass customization; product differentiation; price differentiation; customization level; competition	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; TECHNOLOGY CHOICE; PRICE-COMPETITION; MARKET-STRUCTURE; VARIETY; INVESTMENT; DEMAND	We consider a duopoly market with heterogeneous customer tastes. The firms play a two-stage game. First, each firm chooses whether to invest in mass customization, which would enable it to offer customized products that increasingly match each customer's ideal product as the chosen customization level increases. A firm that chooses not to invest in mass customization serves a standard product. Second, the firms competitively price their product lines. We characterize each firm's investment in mass customization and study its dependence on competitive position, as determined by its cost efficiency and perceived quality vis-a-vis its competitor. We find that the value of mass customization critically depends on the firm's competitive position. It may not be desirable even at zero cost due to its negative effect on price competition. A firm with an overall cost and quality disadvantage never unilaterally adopts mass customization. We show that allowing firms to set different prices for each product configuration leads to a broader adoption of mass customization compared to when they are restricted to uniform prices. However, a firm's chosen customization level may be higher with uniform prices. Our analysis also helps a customizing firm determine whether to target its process improvement efforts for a lower cost or a higher customization level.

Interday forecasting and intraday updating of call center arrivals	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						dimension reduction; dynamic forecast updating; principal component analysis; penalized least squares; singular value decomposition; vector time series	NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS; RIDGE REGRESSION	Accurate forecasting of call arrivals is critical for staffing and scheduling of a telephone call center. We develop methods for interday and dynamic intraday forecasting of incoming call volumes. Our approach is to treat the intraday call volume profiles as a high-dimensional vector time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by singular value decomposition of the matrix of historical intraday profiles and then to apply time series and regression techniques. Our approach takes into account both interday ( or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday ( or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets. Our methods are computationally fast; it is therefore feasible to use them for real-time dynamic forecasting.

The method consists of two steps. First, staffing levels are determined, and next, in the second step, the outcomes are used as input for the scheduling problem. The scheduling problem relies on a linear programming model that is easy to implement and has short computation times, i.e., a fraction of a second. Therefore, it is useful for different purposes and it can be part of an iterative procedure: for example, one that combines shifts into rosters.

J	Randhawa, RS; Kumar, S				Randhawa, Ramandeep S.; Kumar, Sunil			Usage restriction and subscription services: Operational benefits with rational users	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						subscription services; pay-per-use services; operational benefits; pricing; capacity sizing; finite customer population; loss system; on-off model; diffusion approximation	CALL CENTERS; QUEUE; DEMAND; SYSTEM	This paper studies a rental firm that offers reusable products to price- and quality-of-service-sensitive customers - Netflix or Blockbuster can be thought of as the canonical example. Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more pro. table for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option.

J	van Ryzin, G; Vulcano, G				van Ryzin, Garrett; Vulcano, Gustavo			Computing virtual nesting controls for network revenue management under customer choice behavior	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						choice behavior; revenue management; network capacity control; stochastic approximation; stochastic gradients	MODEL	We consider a revenue management, network capacity control problem in a setting where heterogeneous customers choose among the various products offered by a firm ( e. g., different flight times, fare classes, and/or routings). Customers may therefore substitute if their preferred products are not offered. These individual customer choice decisions are modeled as a very general stochastic sequence of customers, each of whom has an ordered list of preferences. Minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. We assume that the firm controls the availability of products using a virtual nesting control strategy and would like to optimize the protection levels for its virtual classes accounting for the ( potentially quite complex) choice behavior of its customers. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity approximation for this problem, which allows for the partial acceptance of requests for products. The model admits an efficient calculation of the sample path gradient of the network revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show the algorithm converges in probability to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The algorithm is relatively efficient even on large network problems, and in our simulation experiments it produces significant revenue increases relative to traditional virtual nesting methods. On a large-scale, real-world airline example using choice behavior models fit to actual booking data, the method produced an estimated 10% improvement in revenue relative to the controls used by the airline. The examples also provide interesting insights into how protection levels should be adjusted to account for choice behavior. Overall, the results indicate that choice behavior has a significant impact on both capacity control decisions and revenue performance and that our method is a viable approach for addressing the problem.

J	Secomandi, N				Secomandi, Nicola			An analysis of the control-algorithm re-solving issue in inventory and revenue management	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multiproduct inventory management; network revenue management; mathematical programming-based dynamic programming approximations; model predictive control; rollout algorithms and policies	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; POLICY	While inventory- and revenue-management problems can be represented as Markov decision process (MDP) models, in some cases the well-known dynamic-programming curse of dimensionality makes it computationally prohibitive to solve them exactly. An alternative solution, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to use a math program ( MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given set of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should an appropriate modi. cation of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventory- and revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive lead time.

Customers travel to the closest facility to obtain service; the problem is to determine the number, locations, and capacity of the facilities. Under rather general assumptions (spatially distributed continuous demand, general arrival and service processes, and nonlinear location and capacity costs) we show that the problem can be decomposed, and construct an efficient optimization algorithm. The analysis yields several insights, including the importance of equitable facility configurations (EFCs), the behavior of optimal and near-optimal capacities, and robust class of solutions that can be constructed for this problem.

The problem is motivated by production planning at a leading U.S. automotive pressure hose manufacturer. One method finds all Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize total production rate variation of models and work in process (WIP), and maximize system utilization and responsiveness. These Pareto-optimal solutions are found efficiently in polynomial time with respect to total demand by an algorithm proposed in the paper. The other method relies on Daniel Webster's method of apportionment for production smoothing, which produces periodic, uniform, and reflective production sequences that can improve operations management of the JIT systems. Finally, the paper presents the results of a computational experiment with the two methods.

An earlier study observed that decision makers tend to anchor their orders around average demand and fail to adjust sufficiently toward the expected profit-maximizing order. Principles of behavioral theory suggest some relatively simple interventions into the decision maker's experience and feedback that might improve performance, and these guide our investigation. The results imply that the institutional organization of experience and feedback may have a significant influence on whether inventory is stocked optimally.

J	Zhao, X; Atkins, DR				Zhao, Xuan; Atkins, Derek R.			Newsvendors under simultaneous price and inventory competition	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor game; pricing; inventory; equilibrium analysis	SERVICE COMPETITION	T his paper extends the theory of N competitive newsvendors to the case where competition occurs simultaneously in price and inventory. The basic research questions are whether the Nash equilibrium exists in this game, whether it is unique, and how the resulting inventories and prices are affected by competition. Using a novel method, we show the quasiconcavity of the competitive newsvendor's problem and establish the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Through a contraction mapping approach, we develop sufficient conditions for the Nash equilibrium to be unique. We then analyze the properties of the equilibrium and compare it with the optimal solution for the (noncompeting) price-sensitive newsvendor. We prove that at a symmetric equilibrium, retail prices and safety stocks strictly increase with the proportion of a newsvendor's unsatisfied customers that switch to a competitor, but strictly decrease with the intensity of price competition. Total inventories, on the other hand, increase with the intensity of price competition. Furthermore, the competitive equilibrium never has lower safety stocks and higher retail prices ( a situation that definitely hurts the customers) than the solution for noncompetitive newsvendors.

The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved ( but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: ( 1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; ( 2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and ( 3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit.

Specifically, it was found that reduction in mean setup times without any change in variance can, paradoxically, increase waiting time and work in process (WIP) in a cyclic production system. Setup time variance was demonstrated to play a central role because of the paradoxes it produced with the resulting harm to effective capacity. Subsequently, explicit formulas were derived for determining whether adding fixed forced idle time (but holding variance constant) would reduce waiting time and, if so, the optimal amount of idle time to add. However, research to date has offered little guidance to reduce setup time variance to improve waiting time. We show that a greater reduction is achievable by adding a variable idle time that is a nonincreasing function of setup time and thereby reduce the combined setup time variance. We provide explicit procedures for finding the optimal variable idle time as a function of setup time when the latter follows any finite discrete distribution. We also show how to implement our policy and show that our approach can improve waiting time even when other currently known approaches cannot.

The POLCA system is particularly appropriate for environments that involve highly variable demand and large product variety, which force small batch (or even one-of-a-kind) production. We propose a load-based version of the POLCA control system (LB-POLCA), which determines the POLCA parameters (release authorizations, allowed workloads in the loops) according to an advanced resources planning (ARP) system that adequately captures the stochastic behavior of the production system and enables fine-tuning and high-level optimization of the manufacturing lot sizes. We also discuss the implementation of an electronic LB-POLCA system in a metal shop of Spicer Off-Highway Products Division, a subsidiary of the Dana Corporation.

The supplier's performance, in terms of optimal cost, optimal stocking level, and implied service level, is investigated under different retailer replenishment sequences. We show that under many realistic demand distributions, it is optimal to sequence retailers according to ascending variability. Furthermore, if the retailers vary in magnitudes of their orders, then the optimal sequence is usually the one with descending magnitudes.

Mass customization vs. mass production: Variety and price competition	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product variety management; mass customization; operations-marketing interface; discrete consumer choice; competitive product strategy; pricing	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; MARKET-STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; ECONOMICS; LINE; PROLIFERATION; FLEXIBILITY; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; DECISIONS	We study competition between two multiproduct firms with distinct production technologies in a market where customers have heterogeneous preferences on a single taste attribute. The mass customizer (MC) has a perfectly flexible production technology and thus can offer any variety within a product space, represented by Hotelling's linear city. The mass producer (MP) has a more focused production technology and therefore offers a finite set of products in the same space. The MP can invest in more flexible technology, which reduces its cost of variety and hence allows it to offer a larger set of products; in the extreme, the MP can emulate the MC's technology and offer infinite variety. The firms simultaneously decide whether to enter the market, and the MP chooses its degree of product-mix flexibility on entry. Next, the MP designs its product line-i.e., the number and position of its products-the MC's perfectly flexible technology makes this unnecessary finally, both firms simultaneously set prices. We analyze the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in this three-stage game, allowing firm-specific fixed and variable costs that together characterize their production technology. We find that an MP facing competition from an MC offers lower product variety than an MP monopolist to reduce the intensity of price competition.

Motivated by a building-products retailer's practice of stocking large quantities of products to stimulate demand, we study inventory management and pricing policies when demand is uncertain but increases with stocking quantity. We first characterize the profit-maximization policy for a stochastic inventory model with a general inventory-dependent demand distribution and given price, and show that demand stimulation (by inventories) has the effect of increasing the target service level beyond the classical newsvendor model's critical fractile ratio. To underscore the importance of considering both demand stochasticity and inventory influence, we consider two functionally oriented benchmark policies-a demand-driven policy and a critical fractile policy-that might, respectively, represent marketing and inventory managers' viewpoints. Our numerical analysis reveals that the optimal policy can generate considerably higher profits than the two complementary functional perspectives. Moreover, we prove that the optimal stocking quantity always exceeds the critical fractile solution and can even exceed the demand-driven stocking quantity. We also address the problem of jointly optimizing both stocking quantity and price for demand-stimulating products using a multiplicative model to represent the influence of price and stocking quantity on the demand distribution for this model, we show that the pricing and stocking decisions can be determined sequentially, with the optimal policy setting higher prices and stock levels than both the functional policies.

J	Chen, L; Plambeck, EL				Chen, Li; Plambeck, Erica L.			Dynamic inventory management with learning about the demand distribution and substitution probability	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bayesian inventory management; unknown demand distribution; unobserved lost sales; substitution probability; Bayesian dynamic programming; optimal inventory control; maximum likelihood estimator; make-to-stock queue	CENSORED NEWSVENDOR; OPTIMAL ACQUISITION; LOST SALES; INFORMATION; MODELS; DECISIONS; IMPACT	A well-known result in the Bayesian inventory management literature is: If lost sales are not observed, the Bayesian optimal inventory level is larger than the myopic inventory level (one should "stock more" to learn about the demand distribution). This result has been proven in other studies under the assumption that inventory is perishable, so the myopic inventory level is equal to the Bayesian optimal inventory level with observed lost sales. We break that equivalence by considering nonperishable inventory. We prove that with nonperishable inventory, the famous "stock more" result is often reversed to "stock less," in that the Bayesian optimal inventory level with unobserved lost sales is lower than the myopic inventory level. We also prove that making lost sales unobservable increases the Bayesian optimal inventory level; in this specific sense, the famous "stock more" result of other studies generalizes to the case of nonperishable inventory. When the product is out of stock, a customer may accept a substitute or choose not to purchase. We incorporate learning about the probability of substitution. This reduces the Bayesian optimal inventory level in the case that lost sales are observed. Reducing the inventory level has two beneficial effects: to observe and learn more about customer substitution behavior and (for a nonperishable product) to reduce the probability of overstocking in subsequent periods. Finally, for a capacitated production-inventory system under continuous review, we derive maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the demand rate and probability that customers will wait for the product. (Accepting a raincheck for delivery at some later time is a common type of substitution.) We investigate how the choice of base-stock level and production rate affect the convergence rate of these MLEs. The results reinforce those for the Bayesian, uncapacitated, periodic review system.

In this paper, we consider an intelligent inventory management tool that accounts for record inaccuracy using a Bayesian belief of the physical inventory level. We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of "freezing," in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular "zero balance walk" audit policy.

Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed.

J	Liu, Q; van Ryzin, G				Liu, Qian; van Ryzin, Garrett			On the choice-based linear programming model for network revenue management	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						network revenue management; choice behavior; multinomial logit choice model; dynamic programming; linear programming	YIELD MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIOR; PRICES; EFFICIENCY; DEMAND; SALES	G allego et al. [Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing "flexible products"-a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e. g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e. g., an origin-destination connection)-their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of " efficiency" developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci. 50 15-33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying " good" offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.

The retailers are supplied with a single product via some warehouses. In these warehouses, the ordered amounts of goods of these retailers become available after some lead time. At the time that the goods arrive at the warehouses, demand realizations are known by the retailers. The retailers can increase their expected joint profits if they can coordinate their orders and make allocations after demand realization. For this setting, we consider an associated cooperative game between the retailers. We show that this associated cooperative game has a nonempty core. Finally, we introduce a noncooperative game, where the retailers decide on their order quantities individually, and show that the set of payoff vectors resulting from strong Nash equilibria corresponds to the core of the associated cooperative game.

Further improvements on base-stock approximations for independent stochastic lead times with order crossover	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory policies/management; base-stock policies; stochastic lead time; order crossover		When inventory replenishments can arrive in a different sequence than the one in which they were placed, it is important to use the shortfall distribution to set the base-stock level. Because the exact shortfall distribution is quite difficult to compute, heuristics are commonly used in its stead. Bradley and Robinson [Bradley, J. R., L. W. Robinson. 2005. Improved base-stock approximations for independent stochastic lead times with order crossover. Manufacturing Service Oper. Management 7 319-329.] developed an upper bound on the variance of the number of outstanding orders that they used within a normal approximation of the shortfall distribution. In this short note, we tighten their upper bound and use it within a beta approximation of the shortfall distribution to derive a policy whose costs average only 0.05% above that of the optimal.
