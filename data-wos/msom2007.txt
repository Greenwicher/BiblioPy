A mathematical model for evaluating cross-sales policies in telephone service centers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						call center management; service management; customer relationship management; cross-selling; threshold policies; optimal queue control		Cross-selling in telephone service centers is seen by industry as a useful means to generate profits from an existing customer base. Introducing cross-sales to a service center, however, needs to be properly managed as it could degrade customer service quality. Real-time customer and system information can be used to set the appropriate control policy for cross-sales to enhance profitability without causing undesirable service degradation for calling customers. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the value of using real-time information in selecting optimal control policies for cross-sales in telephone service centers. Specifically, we develop an introductory mathematical model to incorporate the use of two types of information, system status (queuing congestion) and customer profile (likelihood of purchase) in determining the optimal control policy to maximize the expected operating profit of the system. We hope to stimulate further research in this area by providing a groundwork for further modeling. We show that using more information increases a call center's operating profit. Improvements were dramatic for environments with intermediate utilization and high customer heterogeneity.

J	Dada, M; Petruzzi, NC; Schwarz, LB				Dada, Maqbool; Petruzzi, Nicholas C.; Schwarz, Leroy B.			A newsvendor's procurement problem when suppliers are unreliable	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor; supplier diversification; random yield; multisupplier sourcing; procurement; disruption management	UNCERTAIN DEMAND; RANDOM YIELD; POLICIES; CAPACITY	We consider the problem of a newsvendor that is served by multiple suppliers, where any given supplier is defined to be either perfectly reliable or unreliable. By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, as is the case in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor's suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier's reliability level. Nevertheless, the relative size of a selected supplier's order depends on its reliability.

J	Gans, N; Zhou, YP				Gans, Noah; Zhou, Yong-Pin			Call-routing schemes for call-center outsourcing	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						call routing; outsourcing; priority routing; call-center staffing; bursty call arrival	EXPONENTIAL SERVERS; CONTACT CENTERS; BACK OPTION; QUEUE; POISSON; SYSTEMS; APPROXIMATION; ARRIVALS; DESIGN	Companies may choose to outsource parts, but not all, of their call-center operations. In some cases, they classify customers as high or low value, serving the former with their in-house operations and routing the latter to an outsourcer. Typically, they impose service-level constraints on the time each type of customer waits on hold. This paper considers four schemes for routing low-value calls between the client company and the outsourcer. These schemes vary in the complexity of their routing algorithms, as well as the sophistication of the telephone and information technology infrastructure they require of the two operations. For three of these schemes, this paper provides a direct characterization of system performance. For the fourth, most complex, scheme the paper provides performance bounds for the important special case in which the service requirements of high- and low-value callers are the same. These results allow the systematic comparison of the performance of the various routing schemes. The results suggest that, for clients with large outsourcing requirements, the simpler schemes that require little client-outsourcer coordination can perform very well.

J	Gorman, MF; Kanet, JJ				Gorman, Michael F.; Kanet, J. J.			"OM Forum: Evaluating operations management-related journals via the author affiliation index" - Do professors at top US business schools do what they say?	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations management; journal quality		In Gorman and Kanet (2005) we introduced the Author Affiliation Index (AAI) and how it could be used to rate the quality of operations management-related journals. Since then, Olson (2005) surveyed operations management professors from top U.S. universities and reported their assessment of the quality of various operations management-related journals. This paper compares the results of these two studies and concludes that patterns of research publications match the surveyed opinions from top U.S. universities, or that researchers publish in journals they rate as top. We confirm our earlier finding that the AAI is comparable to surveys for assessing journal quality.

When a workstation fails, it stops operating, and so do all the other workstations upstream of it. The quality of the material trapped in the stopped workstations deteriorates with time. If this material remains immobilized beyond a certain critical time, its quality becomes unacceptable and it must be scrapped. We develop analytical expressions for important system performance measures for two cases. In the first case, the in-process material has no memory of the quality deterioration that it experienced during previous stoppages, whereas in the second case it has. In both cases, we assume that the workstation uptimes and downtimes follow memoryless distributions. We use the analytical expressions to numerically study the effect of system parameters on system performance. To evaluate the memoryless assumption, we compare the performance of the original model to that of a modified model in which the workstation downtimes do not follow memoryless distributions. The performance of the modified model is obtained via simulation.

This problem was first studied by Hall and Porteus (2000) using a dynamic game model. We extend their work by incorporating a general demand model, which enables us to obtain properties that reveal the dynamics of the game and the behavior of the players. In particular, we provide conditions under which the market share of a firm has a positive value and give it an upper bound. We further extend the game competition model to an infinite-horizon setting. We prove that there exists a stationary equilibrium policy and that the dynamic equilibrium policy always converges to a stationary equilibrium policy. We demonstrate that demand patterns will dictate how firms compete rationally and show the likely outcomes of the competition.

Simple relational contracts to motivate capacity investment: Price only vs. price and quantity	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						relational contracts; supply chain management; capacity investment; price-only contracts	SUPPLY CHAIN COORDINATION; INFORMATION; COST; FIRM	Because of long lead times associated with product development and building capacity a supplier must initiate investment in capacity when the product development effort is ongoing. Because the product is ill defined at this point in time, the buyer is unable to commit to the future terms of trade through a court-enforceable contract. Instead, to provide incentives for capacity investment, the buyer informally promises future terms of trade. The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-cluantity promises and compare their performance. If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.

I use empirical research in these fields to formulate a framework for classifying empirical research and illustrate that framework with a few selected examples in operations management. I offer some advice on data sources and approaches to conducting empirical research and suggest ways strengthening empirical research in operations management. This is obviously a partial treatment of a large subject and represents my personal point of view. This paper should encourage comments by others to further develop the topic and to offer alternative points of view.

J	Gans, N; Knox, G; Croson, R				Gans, Noah; Knox, George; Croson, Rachel			Simple models of discrete choice and their performance in bandit experiments	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service quality; multiarmed bandit; decision-making under uncertainty; discrete-choice models; experimental tests	DECISION-MAKING; HOT HAND; UNCERTAINTY; ECONOMICS; BEHAVIOR; GAMES	Recent operations management papers model customers as solving multiarmed bandit problems, positing that consumers use a particular heuristic when choosing among suppliers. These papers then analyze the resulting competition among suppliers and mathematically characterize the equilibrium actions. There remains a question, however, as to whether the original customer models on which the analyses are built are reasonable representations of actual consumer choice. In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems. We find that some of the most analytically tractable models perform best in tests of model fit. We also find that the expected number of consecutive trials of a given supplier is increasing in its expected quality level, with increasing differences, a result consistent with the models' predictions as well as with loyalty effects described in the popular management literature.

J	Rumyantsev, S; Netessine, S				Rumyantsev, Sergey; Netessine, Serguei			What can be learned from classical inventory models? A cross-industry exploratory investigation	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						econometrics; panel data; regression analysis; inventory	SUPPLY CHAIN; PRODUCT VARIETY; COST; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; DETERMINANTS; INVESTMENT; DEMAND; LINE; US	Classical inventory models offer a variety of insights into the optimal way to manage inventories of individual products. However, top managers and industry analysts are often concerned with the aggregate macroscopic view of a firm's inventory rather than with the inventories of individual products. Given that classical inventory models often do not account for many practical considerations that a company's management faces (e.g., competition, industry dynamics, business cycles, the financial state of the company and of the economy, etc.) and that they are derived at the product level and not the firm level, can insights from these models be used to explain the inventory dynamics of entire companies? This exploratory study aims to address this issue using empirical data. We analyze absolute and relative inventories using a quarterly data panel that contains 722 public U.S. companies for the period 1992-2002. We have chosen companies that are not widely diversified and whose business in large part relies on inventory management to concentrate on empirically testing hypotheses derived from a variety of classical inventory models (economic order quantity (EOQ), [Q, r], newsvendor, periodic review, etc.). We find empirical evidence that firms operating with more uncertain demand, longer lead times, and higher gross margins have larger inventories. Furthermore, larger companies appear to benefit from economies of scale and therefore have relatively less inventory than smaller companies. We obtain mixed evidence on the relationship between inventory levels and inventory holding costs. We also analyze the breakdown of data into eight segments-oil and gas, electronics, wholesale, retail, machinery, hardware, food, and chemicals-and find that, with a few notable exceptions, our hypotheses are supported within the segments as well. Overall, our results demonstrate that many of the predictions from classical inventory models extend beyond individual products to the aggregate firm level; hence, these models can help with high-level strategic choices in addition to tactical decisions.

First, we document that inventory holdings have been reduced. The median of wholesale inventory holding periods was reduced from 73 days to 49 days. Retail inventory did not start to decline until about 1995. Second, we document that firms with abnormally high inventories have abnormally poor long-term stock returns. Third, we illustrate these effects for the cases of Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven (Japan), and some related firms.

In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry's "production") is greater than the variance of the industry's sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less seasonal an industry's demand, the more likely the industry amplifies volatility-highly seasonal industries tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify.

Estimating demand uncertainty using judgmental forecasts	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						demand uncertainty; forecast dispersion; heteroscedlasticity	ANALYSTS; SALES; COST	Measuring demand uncertainty is a key activity in supply chain planning, but it is difficult when demand history is unavailable, such as for new products. One method that can be applied in such cases uses dispersion among forecasting experts as a measure of demand uncertainty. This paper provides a test for this method and presents a heteroscedastic regression model for estimating the variance of demand using dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale. We test this methodology using three data sets: demand data at item level, sales data at firm level for retailers, and sales data at firm level for manufacturers. We show that the variance of a random variable (demand and sales for our data sets) is positively correlated with both dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale: The variance increases sublinearly with dispersion and more than linearly with scale. Further, we use longitudinal, data sets with sales forecasts made three to nine months before the earnings report date for retailers and manufacturers to show that the effects of dispersion and scale on variance of forecast error are consistent over time.

J	Tucker, AL				Tucker, Anita L.			An empirical study of system improvement by frontline employees in hospital units	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						health care; system improvement; problem solving; survey research	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONAL FAILURES; WORK; BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATIONS; TECHNOLOGY; REDUCTION; WORKPLACE; KNOWLEDGE; TOYOTA	This paper investigates the conditions under which frontline employees take initiative to improve their work systems to prevent operational failures. Drawing on the system improvement and team learning literatures, we develop a framework of frontline system improvement and test it using survey data from 37 workgroups. We find that psychological safety-the belief that one can talk about errors without risk of punishment- and problem-solving efficacy-the belief that the organization will support employees' system improvement efforts-were positively correlated with frontline system improvement (FLSI). Surprisingly, felt responsibility was negatively associated with FLSI. These findings suggest that rather than relying on hiring motivated individuals, managers need to support employees' efforts to improve their work systems by creating a work environment where it is safe to talk about operational failures and responding to employee communication about operational failures. Doing this may result in higher levels of FLSI efforts and ultimately improve work processes.

J	Tsikriktsis, N				Tsikriktsis, Nikos			The effect of operational performance and focus on profitability: A longitudinal study of the US airline industry	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operational performance; profitability; quality; operations strategy; focus; airlines	CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; SERVICE QUALITY; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY RESEARCH; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; DISSATISFACTION; ORGANIZATIONS; FIT	We study the impact of operational performance on profitability in the context of the U.S. domestic airline industry. In addition, we investigate the impact of focus [Skinner, W. 1974. The focused factory. Harvard Bus. Rev. 52(3) 113-121] on profitability in services. We use quarterly data on all major carriers, available since the introduction of required reporting of service indicators to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Our analysis demonstrates two main points. First, the relationship between operational performance and profitability is contingent on a company's operating model; "focused" airlines show a link between late arrivals and profitability while full-service airlines do not. Also, capacity utilization is a stronger driver of profitability for full-service airlines than for focused airlines. Second, focused airlines outperform the rest of the industry in terms of profitability.

Using empirical data from multiple stores of a consumer electronics retailer, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, we highlight the extent to which store manager incentive design impacts store manager behavior and, consequently, retail performance. More specifically, we describe the shift in store manager behavior resulting from a change in incentives, which, in part, altered the importance of sales relative to inventory shrinkage in the store manager compensation plan. Store managers, following this change, directed less attention to the prevention of inventory shrinkage and more toward sales-generating activities and made different process choices within the store. We observed increases in the level of inventory shrinkage and sales within these stores. Controlling for alternative drivers of sales and inventory shrinkage, we find this change in incentive design to be associated with a profit improvement of 4.2% of sales. This work indicates that altering how store managers are compensated impacts retail performance. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of balancing the rewards given for different types of activities in contexts where agents face multiple competing tasks.

Customer efficiency, channel usage, and firm performance in retail banking	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations management; service delivery system; self-service technology (SST); service coproduction; customer efficiency	SERVICE QUALITY; PRODUCTIVITY; DETERMINANTS; INDUSTRY; CONTACT; MANAGEMENT; DELIVERY	Innovations in technology and service design have increasingly enabled firms to incorporate self-service technology to augment or substitute for "traditional" employee-provided service channels. Although it is clear that self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization.

Examining the influence of operational intellectual capital on capabilities and performance	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						operations strategy; operational intellectual capital; operating capabilities; business performance; structural equation modeling	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGING KNOWLEDGE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; TECHNOLOGY	Managers have long been challenged by an abundance of internal and external demands and uncertainties in their operating environments. Anecdotal evidence and a growing number of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level operating capabilities critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i.e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level operating capabilities such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U.S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on operating capabilities and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm.

J	Bardhan, IR; Krishnan, VV; Lin, S				Bardhan, Indranil R.; Krishnan, Vish V.; Lin, Shu			Project performance and the enabling role of information technology: An exploratory study on the role of alignment	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						project management; information technology alignment; structure; uncertainty; volatility	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; STRATEGY; ENVIRONMENTS; FIT; CAPABILITIES; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY; INNOVATION; FRAMEWORK; INDUSTRY	As firms focus on new product, process, and service innovations, improving the performance and productivity of projects that help deliver these innovations assumes greater importance. Information technology (IT) has been an enabler of manufacturing productivity improvement, but its effect on improving the productivity of innovation-intensive operational activities has been mixed. In this paper, we explore the pathways through which IT impacts project-level performance measured in terms of speed, quality, and cost. Specifically, in this exploratory study we seek to present a theory of how the fit between enabling IT and the core characteristics of the project impacts project performance. We test our research hypotheses empirically, using a relatively large, cross-sectional sample of project data. The central contribution is the development and testing of a research model to improve our understanding of the relationship between enabling IT-project alignment, project competencies, and project performance. In doing so, our study clarifies the role of information technologies in project management, providing insights into how to integrate IT into innovation-intensive operational activities for improving project execution competence and productivity.

Investment into productive resources is made before demand realization, hence the supply chain faces the risk of under- or overinvestment. The CM and OEMs differ in their forecast accuracy and in their resource pooling capabilities, leading to a disparity in their ability to minimize costs due to demand uncertainty. We consider two scenarios in which this risk is borne by the OEM and CM, respectively. We determine which party should bear the risk so that maximum supply chain profits are achieved. We investigate the effectiveness of premium-based schemes in inducing the best party to bear the risk, and conclude that they function well despite information asymmetry when double marginalization is not very high.

We show what types of coordination mechanisms allow the decentralized supply chain to generate aggregate expected profits equal to the optimal profits in a centralized system, and how the parameters of these (perfect) coordination schemes can be determined. We assume that the retailers face stochastic demand functions that may depend on all of the firms' prices as well as a measure of their service levels, e.g., the steady-state availability of the products. We systematically compare the coordination mechanisms when retailers compete only in terms of their prices, and when they engage in simultaneous price and service competition.

We analyze the decentralization cost (DC), i.e., the ratio between the Nash equilibrium cost and the cost attained at the centralized optimum. Solution properties of a dispatching-sequencing model are derived and subsequently used to develop bounds on the DC for an arbitrary number of jobs and DMs. A scheduling-based coordinating mechanism is then provided, ensuring that the centralized solution is obtained at equilibrium.

J	Cachon, GP; Kok, AG				Cachon, Gerard P.; Kok, A. Gurhan			Implementation of the newsvendor model with clearance pricing: How to (and how not to) estimate a salvage value	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						markdown management; game theory; retailing; inventory; revenue management	INVENTORY SYSTEMS; DEMAND; POLICIES; MARKET; MANAGEMENT; BOUNDS; SALES; UNCERTAINTY; INVESTMENT; PRODUCTS	The newsvendor model is designed to decide how much of a product to order when the product is to be sold over a short selling season with stochastic demand and there are no additional opportunities to replenish inventory. There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one. We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity Our results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how the model's inputs should be estimated.

J	Dong, LX; Zhu, KJ				Dong, Lingxiu; Zhu, Kaijie			Two-wholesale-price contracts: Push, pull, and advance-purchase discount contracts	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pareto improvement; contracting; pricing; advance purchase; newsvendor model	SUPPLY CHAIN; INFORMATION; RETAILER; DEMAND	The allocation of inventory ownership affects the inventory availability in a supply chain, which in turn determines the supply chain performance. In this paper, we consider a supplier-retailer supply chain in which the supplier starts production well in advance of the selling season, and the retailer is offered two ordering opportunities at different points in time. An early order is allowed before the supplier's production decision, and a late order is allowed after the completion of production and after observing the demand. When the two wholesale prices change, we illustrate how the inventory decision rights and ownership are shifted and/or shared between the two firms, resulting in push, pull, or advance-purchase discount contracts. We then characterize the complete set of Pareto-dominant contracts for any given two-wholesale-price contract. We find that Pareto improvement can be achieved when inventory ownership is shifted from individual to shared and sometimes vice versa. In the latter case, push contracts not only are more likely to offer Pareto improvement, but also can achieve higher supply chain efficiency than pull contracts. We also identify conditions that enable Pareto improvement by introducing a new ordering opportunity to firms that had been bound by a single ordering opportunity without renegotiating the existing wholesale price, and we demonstrate through a numerical study that the adoption of the new ordering opportunity can significantly improve supply chain efficiency. We show that such Pareto improvement is more likely to happen when demand is more volatile.

Over the last several years, B2B exchanges have attempted to provide supply for storable industrial goods with some degree of design specification (as opposed to undifferentiated commodities). Through this research, we elucidate some aspects of how speculative online exchanges with a small number of participants might behave and the impact they will have on the use of long-term contracts for supply. By endogenizing the evolution of spot prices in response to buyers' and their supplier's actions, we produce price fluctuations that exhibit significant autocorrelation in such markets. We show that participating buyers accrue network benefits as the number of participating firms increases through the inventory-pooling effects, resulting in reduced costs for them. However, a supplier acting strategically win counteract such benefits by restricting availability of goods to the spot market, sacrificing short-term spot-market revenue for long-term contract volume.

Companies have to quote attainable delivery dates and then meet these, or face large tardiness penalties. We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with due date assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions of the amount of a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The due date assignment methods studied include the common due date, the slack due date, which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted due dates, when each job may be assigned a different due date. For each combination of due date assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, due date values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and due date assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs.

Competition and diversification effects in supply chains with supplier default risk	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						resilient supply chains; supply risk; supply disruptions; competition; procurement; default correlation; equilibrium pricing		We study the effects of disruption risk in a supply chain where one retailer deals with competing risky suppliers who may default during their production lead times. The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated. However, as the number of suppliers increases, our model predicts that the retailer may be able to take advantage of both competition and diversification.

These changes are expected to have a significant impact on operating policies at those depository institutions that handle large volumes of currency. We describe two business models that capture the flow of currency between a bank and the Fed; the first model captures the current operations of most banks, while the second is expected to be adapted by many banks in response to the new guidelines. Motivated by our work with Brink's, Inc., to assess the economic impact that banks will sustain from these guidelines, we present a detailed analysis that provides managers of banks with optimal strategies to manage the flow of currency to and from the Fed for a variety of cost structures and demand patterns. Given this insight into a bank's optimal behavior, the Fed can also use our analysis to fine tune its guidelines to achieve the desired goals.

In this context, we study the machine-repairman problem with heterogeneous machines but with partially cross-trained repairmen. We introduce simple repairman-assignment rules as well as machine-priority rules that are effective in minimizing the machine downtime costs, or balancing the percentage of working machines of different types. We show that static machine priority rules are effective in minimizing systems downtime costs, while a generalized version of the longest queue policy is effective in balancing the percentage of working machines. We also introduce the concept of hidden symmetry in repair environments, and show that the well-known chain repairman skill set structure performs very well in repair environments with hidden symmetry. Finally, we provide insights into the design and control issues of repair/maintenance systems with cross-trained repairmen.

J	Kok, AG; Shang, KH				Kok, A. Gurhan; Shang, Kevin H.			Inspection and replenishment policies for systems with inventory record inaccuracy	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory control; inventory inaccuracy; cycle-count policy; RFID	MARKOVIAN DETERIORATION; QUALITY-CONTROL; INFORMATION; OPERATIONS; REPAIR	For many companies, inventory record inaccuracy is a major obstacle to achieving operational excellence. In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy. Finally, by comparing the costs associated with these policies and several benchmark systems, we quantify the true value of accurate inventory information, which may be provided by radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems.

J	Stecke, KE; Zhao, XY				Stecke, Kathryn E.; Zhao, Xuying			Production and transportation integration for a make-to-order manufacturing company with a commit-to-delivery business mode	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						make to order; scheduling; commit to delivery	SUPPLY CHAIN; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; COORDINATION; ASSIGNMENT; TARDINESS; DATES	When a make-to-order manufacturing company adopts a commit-to-delivery business mode, it commits a delivery due date for an order and is responsible for the shipping cost. Without loss of generality, we consider that transportation is done by a third-party logistics company, such as FedEx or UPS, which provides multiple shipping modes such as overnight, one-day, two-day delivery, and more. When the transportation time has to be short, clearly, shipping cost is more expensive than it could have been. How should a company schedule production for accepted orders so that the company can leave enough transportation time for orders to take slow shipping modes to reduce the shipping cost? We study this problem of integrating the production and transportation functions for a manufacturing company producing a variety of customized products in a make-to-order environment with a commit-to-delivery mode of business. Various realistic scenarios are investigated in increasing order of complexity. When partial delivery is allowed by customers, we provide both a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and a minimum cost flow model. We show that nonpreemptive earliest due date (NEDD) production schedules are optimal when partial delivery is allowed and shipping cost is a decreasing convex function with transportation time. When partial delivery is not allowed, we develop an MIP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. An efficient heuristic algorithm with polynomial computation time is provided for the NP-hard problem. It gives near-optimal production schedules, as shown via thousands of numerical experiments. We also provide models and analysis for other scenarios where shipping cost accounts for customer locations and quantity discounts.
