J	Jack, EP; Stephens, PR; Evans, JR				Jack, EP; Stephens, PR; Evans, JR			An integrative summary of doctoral dissertation research in quality management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality management; Baldrige Award; research methodology	VALIDATION; TQM	Since 1980, practitioner interest in the field of quality management (Qm) has grown significantly, resulting in academic researchers embracing Qm as a legitimate discipline of study. One approach to evaluating the intellectual health of a discipline is an examination of doctoral dissertation research. This work both complements and extends other published reviews of the quality management discipline by analyzing doctoral dissertation research since 1981, categorizing this research, examining shifts in major research themes, evaluating data collection and analysis methodologies, and discussing general trends in this research area. Our findings suggest that the challenges in Qm have become more interdisciplinary and integrated, and reveal an encouraging trend toward more rigorous research methodologies and the increased use of theories from other disciplines, leading to a more mature body of research in this field.

J	Sousa, R; Voss, CA				Sousa, R; Voss, CA			Quality management: Universal or context dependent?	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality management; manufacturing strategy; contingency research; empirical research	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; BUSINESS STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; FIRMS	Quality management has often been advocated as being universally applicable to organizations. This is in contrast with the manufacturing strategy contingency approach of Operations Management that advocates internal and external consistency between manufacturing strategy choices. This article empirically investigates whether quality management practices are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy context, by examining the use of process quality management practices-a critical and distinctive subset of the whole set of quality management practices-across plants representative of different manufacturing strategy contexts. The study strongly suggests that process quality management practices are contingent on a plant's manufacturing strategy, and identifies mechanisms by which this takes place.

J	Hays, JM; Hill, AV				Hays, JM; Hill, AV			A longitudinal study of the effect of a service guarantee on service quality	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service recovery; complaint management; customer satisfaction; service guarantees; empirical research	CUSTOMER COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT; MARKET SHARE; IMPACT; SATISFACTION; PROSPECTS; PARADIGM; FAILURES; ERROR	This paper develops a theoretical framework that relates a service guarantee to service quality. The framework hypothesizes that a service guarantee can positively affect service quality through its positive effect on both learning through service failure and employee motivation and vision. A longitudinal, empirical study was conducted to test these hypotheses. Surprisingly, the service guarantee was not found to have a direct effect on learning through service failure. However, the service guarantee clearly had a positive effect on service quality primarily through its positive effect on employee motivation and vision. The research strongly supports using a service guarantee to improve service quality.

In the context of the automotive industry, we present a framework that examines the simultaneous impact of product and service quality on consumers' purchase intentions. The framework is operationalized as several hypotheses that posit relationships between service quality, service satisfaction, product quality, and customer loyalty. The hypotheses are tested using three sources of data: (i) archival data on product quality and customer purchases, (ii) consumersi responses to a survey instrument, and (iii) Consumer Reports. Results indicate general support for main hypotheses proposed.

J	Stewart, DM; Grout, JR				Stewart, DM; Grout, JR			The human side of mistake-proofing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						poka-yoke; human error; mistake-proofing; cognitive psychology; quality	HUMAN RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT; HUMAN ERROR IDENTIFICATION; ECONOMIC DESIGN; INSPECTION; QUALITY; CHARTS	Poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) is a powerful quality improvement approach, which usually employs relatively simple devices to achieve marked improvements. Inexpensive jigs, fixtures, switches, and gauges act as obvious environmental cues to signal mistake detection. Poka-yoke has been largely ignored as an avenue for serious academic research. This paper provides scientific underpinning to the largely anecdotal mistake-proofing literature, by drawing upon research from psychology and cognitive science concerning human error. We delineate areas where additional research would be worthwhile, and guide practitioners in understanding what they are trying to accomplish and how poka-yoke devices attain this end.

J	Kathuria, R; Davis, EB				Kathuria, R; Davis, EB			Quality and work force management practices: The managerial performance implication	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; quality; work force management; performance	PATH ANALYTIC MODEL; LEADERSHIP	Quality has been in the limelight as organizations have sought to create a competitive advantage and theorists have sought to understand the implications of quality management. This paper examines the synergistic effects of the quality emphasis in the organizations, the use of appropriate work force management practices. and the managerial performance outcomes as interactive phenomena. Using data from multiple levels of employees in manufacturing units in various industries, we tested hypotheses regarding the managerial performance impact of the synergy in work force management practices and the quality emphasis. The results indicate that the effectiveness of work force management practices in enhancing managerial performance varies with the emphasis on quality that is manifested by meeting and exceeding customer needs and preferences through accurate, consistent, reliable, and durable products, and by making design changes in the products as desired by the customer.

The paper compares the cases of two British contract electronics assemblers, the first one having achieved a high level of performance on productivity, quality, and dependability, and the second one having achieved a lower level of performance on these criteria but higher flexibility. The case material is used to develop a "high school" analogy that helps to understand why companies come to achieve cumulative manufacturing performance in an industrial sector where competitive pressure is particularly high.

J	Fynes, B; Voss, C				Fynes, B; Voss, C			A path analytic model of quality practices, quality performance, and business performance	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quality practices and performance; design quality; path analysis; empirical research	DEMING MANAGEMENT METHOD; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; IMPACT; TQM; MARKET; DESIGN	Much of the early literature in the area of quality management literature is anecdotal, prescriptive, and methodologically suspect. As such, theory construction and rigorous empirical testing is a relatively recent development with the emphasis very much on quality practices. However, the various dimensions of quality performance and the relationship between them have received less attention from the research community. More specifically, the role of design quality has not been fully addressed in empirical studies. To address this gap we developed a path model incorporating quality practices, design quality, conformance quality, external quality-in-use, product cost, time-to-market, customer satisfaction and business performance.

The paper first determines whether a stable relationship among price, aspects of quality, and the sales rate exists, by examining the equilibrium properties of a dynamic model. Then, we use the derived equilibrium expressions to develop insights into the strategic nature of "quality reputation" and, how to integrate marketing (i.e., pricing) and quality related decisions. The paper shows under certain conditions it might be more advantageous to manipulate "quality reputation" through advertising and product innovations than to increase product quality. We comment on quality based strategic options a firm must consider to ensure long run growth and profitability.

We draw on two unique surveys of 31 automobile assembly plants in North America and Japan, which contain information on manufacturing practice and environmental performance, as well as in-depth interviews with 156 plant level employees at 17 assembly plants. Our survey results and interviews suggest that lean management and reduction of air emissions of volatile organic compounds (vocs) are associated negatively. Lean manufacturing practices contribute to more efficient use of paints and cleaning solvents, but these in-process changes are not sufficient to meet the most stringent air regulations. We found some evidence to support the link between lean practices and resource efficiency. While our survey results were in hypothesized direction, they were not statistically significant. In-depth semi-structured interviews, however, suggest a more robust relationship, and we use them to describe some mechanisms by which all three aspects of lean management (buffer minimization, work systems, and human resource management) may be related to environmental management practices and performance.

However, empirical evidence of the link between lean production practices and environmental performance has not resolved the nature of the relationship. To explore this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis of the environmental performance of 17,499 U.S. manufacturing establishments during the time period 1991-1996. We find that those establishments that adopt the quality management standard ISO 9000 are more likely to adopt the environmental management standard ISO 14000. We also find strong evidence that lean production, as measured by ISO 9000 adoption and low chemical inventories, is complementary to waste reduction and pollution reduction.

J	Klassen, RD				Klassen, RD			Plant-level environmental management orientation: The influence of management views and plant characteristics	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						natural environment; manufacturing strategy; environment performance and social orientation	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE; PROFITABILITY; GREEN	As customers, the public and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding that manufacturing firms improve their approach to environmental management, some plants have moved to develop an orientation that is increasingly proactive. Synthesizing earlier,research, environmental management orientation is defined here to include system analysis and planning, organizational responsibility, and management controls. The relationship between a proactive orientation and two sets of internal factors, specifically the personal views of plant managers and plant-specific characteristics, was tested using survey data from the furniture industry. The production outlook for the plant was critical, with a favorable outlook fostering a more proactive environmental management, orientation. After controlling for plant-specific factors, personal views also were influential; an increasing emphasis on short-term economic value was related to a more reactive plant-level orientation. Thus senior corporate management can foster strong plant-level environmental management through a more balanced emphasis on economic and ethical values and continued investment in a plant's long-term viability.

Challenges firms may encounter in motivating and holding employees and process owners accountable for environmental performance are discussed, as well as a potential for inconsistencies between management's espoused theories and theories in use. A case study of a steel manufacturer is used to determine how accountability for and awareness of environmental objectives can be operationally implemented.

J	Wolf, FG				Wolf, FG			Operationalizing and testing normal accident theory in petrochemical plants and refineries	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	60th Annual Meeting of the Academy-of-Management	AUG   07, 2000	TORONTO, CANADA	Acad Management		normal accidents; technology; risk; refineries		Since "Normal Accidents: Living With High-Risk Technologies" was first published in 1984, there have been very few tests of its validity or its application to different classes of technology or organizations. This paper describes a robust, parametric test of Normal Accident Theory applied to a class of high-risk systems: petrochemical plants and refineries. The theory has important implications for scholars interested in the relationship of organizations to the natural environment and managers responsible for safe, socially responsible, and environmentally appropriate operation of high-con sequence systems.

J	Delmas, M				Delmas, M			STAKEHOLDERS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: THE CASE OF ISO 14001	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						STAKEHOLDERS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; NATURAL ENVIRONMENT; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY; STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; FIRM	This paper integrates a stakeholder perspective into the resource-based view of the firm, to analyze the mechanisms that link the adoption of the international Environmental Management Standard ISO 14001 to firms' competitive advantage. This paper shows that the perceived competitiveness impact of the standard depends mostly on the involvement of firms' external stakeholders (distributors, customers, community members, and regulatory agencies) in its design. ISO 14001 is a process standard, and it is difficult for stakeholders to get credible information on the effectiveness of the standard if they are not involved in its design. Stakeholders' involvement in a firm's ISO 14001 standard becomes a valuable organizational capability, which is difficult to imitate by competitors. The analysis is supported by primary data collected from a questionnaire mailed to 152 firms, resulting in 55 observations representing 30% of the total number of firms certified in the U.S. in August 1998.

A number of firms are already engaged in this activity. They remanufacture automobile, truck, and other vehicle components. like starters, alternators, transmissions, and so forth. These firms take in used components, disassemble them. and assemble saleable products from the good parts they find. There is considerable uncertainty in the supply of used components. the good parts in those components, and the demand for remanufactured products. Our system is based on material requirements planning logic, something that many firms in the industry are already familiar with. Meetings with experts in the industry were used to set the parameters of the system and evaluate its approach.

J	Majumder, P; Groenevelt, H				Majumder, P; Groenevelt, H			Competition in remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; competition; reverse logistics	INVENTORY	We present a two-period model of remanufacturing in the face of competition. In our model, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) competes with a local remanufacturer (L) under many reverse logistics configurations for the returned items. After establishing the Nash Equilibrium in the second period sub-game, we use numerical experiments for comparative statics. OEM wants to increase L'S remanufacturing cost. Surprisingly, while L Competes in the sales market, she has incentives to reduce OEM's remanufacturing cost. A social planner who wants to increase remanufacturing can give incentives to the OEM to increase the fraction available for remanufacturing, or reduce his remanufacturing costs.

However, this may prove to be an unrealistic expectation since a rational firm will only engage in profitable ventures; those that increase shareholder wealth. We develop a framework for analyzing the profitability of reuse activities and show how the management of product returns influences operational requirements. We show that the acquisition of used products may be used as the control lever for the management and profitability of reuse activities. These activities, termed product acquisition management, affect several important business decisions. First, if a firm is to pursue reuse activities. these reuse activities must be value-creating. Second, if a firm is to compete by offering remanufactured products, then we show how product returns management influences the overall profitability of such activities via a trial and error EVA(R) approach. Third, we show how operational issues are strongly affected by the approach used to manage product returns. There is a need for future research specifying the mathematical relationship between acquisition price and the nominal quality of the returned product.

In this paper we consider logistics network design in a reverse logistics context. We present a generic facility location model and discuss differences with traditional logistics settings. Moreover, we use our model to analyze the impact of product return flows on logistics networks. We show that the influence of product recovery is very much context dependent. While product recovery may efficiently be integrated in existing logistics structures in many cases, other examples require a more comprehensive approach redesigning a company's logistics network in an integral way.

J	Bowen, FE; Cousins, PD; Lamming, RC; Faruk, AC				Bowen, FE; Cousins, PD; Lamming, RC; Faruk, AC			The role of supply management capabilities in green supply	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						resource-based; environmental management; purchasing and supply management	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM; IMPLEMENTATION; STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE	Managers realize that they should avoid complex green supply initiatives when they do not have the capabilities to implement them. However, they have little guidance on how these capabilities can be developed. This paper provides an initial analysis of the role of supply management capabilities in green supply. We argue that the implementation of green supply is better explained by focusing on the development and deployment of an organization's specialized internal resources, rather than by the more usual focus on external environmental pressures on a firm. Further. we argue that capabilities appropriate for green supply are developed by a proactive corporate environmental stance and by a more strategic purchasing and supply management approach. We test our model using data from a two-phase survey of 70 operating units within UK public limited companies. Our results indicate support for our conjecture that supply management capabilities are jointly developed by a proactive corporate environmental approach and a strategic purchasing and supply process. Our study results should be useful to business strategists, regulators, and researchers interested in the predictors of corporate green behavior. They should also assist future researchers in many branches of environmental management who are seeking to explore the role of the internal capabilities of firms in supporting environmental management.

J	Snir, EM				Snir, EM			Liability as a catalyst for product stewardship	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						liability; product stewardship; mitigation; environmental damage		Product stewardship is the set of practices related to reducing risks from chemical and process hazards in a company's supply chain. This paper develops an economic framework for evaluating supply chain liability as a driver for adopting product stewardship. Companies that outsource production may face residual liability for damages from use of their products, when liabilities are large enough to exceed supply chain partners' assets. The resulting potential liabilities can be mitigated through product stewardship. This paper shows that extended supply chain liabilities provide incentives for investing in reducing environmental hazards throughout the supply chain.

Transportation is frequently a major component of this life-cycle impact. Hence, to reduce total environmental impact, logistics managers will have to become more sophisticated in their understanding of how they can reduce the environmental impact of their transportation operations, without negatively affecting the cost or effectiveness of these operations. In line with this mandate, we quantify the dynamic impact of road vehicles on the environment. In most emission models, a constant speed is used depending only on the specific road type. Using such a model will lead to an underestimation of the effective emissions. It turns out that the differences with a more realistic dynamic assessment model are significant. The analysis here suggests that the policy consequences of these differences for both public sector managers and private companies are potentially quite important.

J	Narasimhan, R; Jayaram, J; Carter, JR				Narasimhan, R; Jayaram, J; Carter, JR			An empirical examination of the underlying dimensions of purchasing competence	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						second-order factor analysis; purchasing competence; structural equation models	STRATEGIC GROUP MEMBERS; PERFORMANCE; CONSTRUCTS; PARADIGM	The importance of evaluating the effectiveness of the purchasing function in firms along multiple criteria has attracted considerable attention. However, few studies have identified the defining elements that constitute purchasing competence. This paper introduces the construct of purchasing competence using a second-order factor structure derived from purchasing practices identified from the literature. The validity of the construct (purchasing competence) is tested using data from a sample of 179 firms. The results indicate (1) the construct validity of purchasing competence and (2) the predictive validity of purchasing competence, which has a significant positive influence on total quality management performance and customer satisfaction. The implications of these findings for additional research are discussed.

We investigated contextual factors of two types: non-managerial (product diversity, product customization, production instability, and organizational size) and managerial (just-in-time and quality management), that might have confounded past results. Our results indicate that the extent Of EDI Use is significantly related to delivery performance after controlling for the above-mentioned factors. Furthermore. the data set supported the moderating effect of production instability on the relationship between the extent of EDI use and delivery performance achieved, but failed to support the moderating effect of organizational size.

J	Chaouch, BA				Chaouch, BA			Stock levels and delivery rates in vendor-managed inventory programs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory control; vendor-managed inventory; delivery frequency; probabilistic models	STOCHASTIC LEAD TIMES; MODEL; DEMAND; SYSTEM	Using the latest information technology, powerful retailers like Wal-Mart have taken the lead in forging shorter replenishment-cycles, automated supply systems with suppliers. With the objective to reduce cost, these retailers are directing suppliers to take full responsibility for managing stocks and deliveries. Suppliers' performance is measured according to how often inventory is shipped to the retailer, and how often customers are unable to purchase the product because it is out of stock. This emerging trend also implies that suppliers are absorbing a large part of the inventory and delivery costs and, therefore, must plan delivery programs including delivery frequency to ensure that the inherent costs are minimized. With the idea to incorporate this shift in focus, this paper looks at the problem facing the supplier who wants quicker replenishment at lower cost. In particular, we present a model that seeks the best trade-off among inventory investment, delivery rates, and permitting shortages to occur, given some random demand pattern for the product. The process generating demand consists of two components: one is deterministic and the other is random. The random part is assumed to follow a compound Poisson process. Furthermore, we assume that the supplier may fail to meet uniform shipping schedules, and, therefore, uncertainty is present in delivery times. The solution to this transportation-inventory problem requires determining jointly delivery rates and stock levels that will minimize transportation, inventory, and shortage costs. Several numerical results are presented to give a feel of the optimal policy's general behavior.

The results of the study show that the selection of LSRs and the parameters for freezing the MPS have a significant impact on total cost, schedule instability, and the service level of the system. However, the selection of LSRs does not significantly influence the selection of the MPS freezing parameters. The basic conclusions concerning the performance of the freezing parameters under a capacity constraint agreed with previous research findings without consideration of capacity constraints.

J	Armentano, VA; Berretta, RE; Franca, PM				Armentano, VA; Berretta, RE; Franca, PM			Lot-sizing in capacitated multi-stage serial systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						lot-sizing; multi-stage production systems; serial systems; heuristics	REQUIREMENTS PLANNING SYSTEMS; ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS; LEAD TIMES; HEURISTICS; BOTTLENECK; FORMULATION; COMPLEXITY	The lot-sizing problem in capacitated multi-stage systems with a serial product structure is addressed. This is a complex optimization problem that is part of the decision set in material requirements planning (MRP) systems. The mathematical model that describes the problem uses the concept of echelon stock and includes lead times. Setup times are taken into account, which implies that the problem of finding a feasible solution is NP-Complete. This paper proposes a heuristic method that provides a production plan in order to minimize inventory, production, and Setup costs. The heuristic starts from a solution for the uncapacitated problem, which is given by the sequential application of the Wagner-Whitin algorithm. Feasibility is then attempted by shifting production amounts between periods. Computational tests conducted in 1,800 instances with LIP to 40 components and 18 periods have shown that feasible solutions were obtained in 83.7% of the instances. For the infeasible instances. on average, the heuristic is able to find solutions with very low capacity excess. The solutions' quality is evaluated through a lower bound provided by Lagrangean relaxation and on average the gap is less than 10%.

J	Schmenner, RW				Schmenner, RW			Looking ahead by looking back: Swift, even flow in the history of manufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						productivity; theory; manufacturing history		Manufacturing history is too often neglected in operations management and its lessons lost. Its usefulness for testing theory is under-appreciated. This paper uses critical aspects of the history of manufacturing to provide support for the Theory of Swift, Even Flow as an explanation of productivity gain. The rise of Britain in the Industrial Revolution and the rapid overtaking of Britain by the United States and Germany are argued to be thoroughly consistent with Swift, Ever Flow, thereby vindicating both theory and the usefulness of history.

I identify international relations as a major driver of the three components-demand, innovations, and capital formation-of the Industrial Revolution. I also offer an alternate perspective on hypotheses proposed by Schmenner in the preceding article in this issue.
