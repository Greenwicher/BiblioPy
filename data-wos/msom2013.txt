We use benchmarking metrics obtained from operations management literature to demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between abnormal inventory growth and one-year-ahead earnings per share for retailers. We also find that equity analysts do not fully incorporate the information contained in retailers' abnormal inventory growth in their earnings forecasts, resulting in systematic biases. Finally, we show that an investment strategy based on abnormal inventory growth yields significant abnormal stock market returns.

In this paper, we propose additional flexibility design guidelines for unbalanced networks, where the numbers of plants and products are not equal, by refining the well-known Chaining Guidelines. We study symmetric networks, where all plants have the same capacity and product demands are independent and identically distributed, and focus mainly on the case where each product is built at two plants. We also briefly discuss cases where (1) each product is built at three plants and (2) some products are built at only one plant. An extensive computational study suggests that our refinements work very well for finding flexible configurations with minimum shortfall in unbalanced networks.

Postponement, component commonality, and resource flexibility are some examples. Motivated by our experience in the aftermarket services industry, we propose a model of inventory pooling to meet differentiated service levels for multiple customers. Our central research question is the following: What are the minimum inventory level and optimal allocation policy when a pool of inventory is used in a single period to satisfy individual service levels for multiple customers? We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons. We show that the pooling benefit is always strictly positive, even when there are an arbitrary number of customers with perfectly positively correlated demands.

Delegation vs. Control of Component Procurement Under Asymmetric Cost Information and Simple Contracts	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multitier supply chain; delegation; control; asymmetric information; component procurement; contract design; price-only contracts; quantity discount contracts; robust optimization	INCENTIVES; DECENTRALIZATION	A manufacturer must choose whether to delegate component procurement to her tier 1 supplier or control it directly. Because of information asymmetry about suppliers' production costs and the use of simple quantity discount or price-only contracts, either delegation or control can yield substantially higher expected profit for the manufacturer. Delegation tends to outperform control when (1) the manufacturer is uncertain about the tier 1 supplier's cost and believes that it is likely to be high; (2) the manufacturer and the tier 1 supplier know the tier 2 supplier's cost or at least that it will be high; (3) the manufacturer has an alternative to engaging the tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers, such as in-house production; and (4) the firms use price-only contracts as opposed to quantity discount contracts. These results shed light on practices observed in the electronics industry.

J	Li, CH; Zhang, FQ				Li, Cuihong; Zhang, Fuqiang			Advance Demand Information, Price Discrimination, and Preorder Strategies	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						preorder; advance demand information; price discrimination; strategic consumer behavior; price guarantee	BOOKING DISCOUNT PROGRAMS; FORWARD-LOOKING CONSUMERS; CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; EARLY SALES; CAPACITY; COMMITMENT; GUARANTEES; DECISIONS; PRODUCTS; ORDERS	This paper studies the preorder strategy that a seller may use to sell a perishable. product in an uncertain market with heterogeneous consumers. By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer Once guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the seller's profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season. We also investigate the seller's strategy choice in such a setting (i.e., whether the preorder option should be offered and whether it should be coupled with price guarantees) and find that the answer depends on the relative sizes of the heterogeneous consumer segments.

We evaluate the forecasting accuracy of those models by describing results from an empirical study analyzing real-life call center data. We test forecasting accuracy using different lead times, ranging from weeks to hours in advance, to mimic real-life challenges faced by call center managers. The models considered are (i) a benchmark fixed-effects model that does not exploit any dependence structures in the data; (ii) a mixed-effects model that takes into account both interday (day-to-day) and intraday (within-day) correlations; and (iii) two new bivariate mixed-effects models, for the joint distribution of the arrival counts to two separate queues, that exploit correlations between different call types. Our study shows the importance of accounting for different correlation structures in the data.

J	Ceryan, O; Sahin, O; Duenyas, I				Ceryan, Obert; Sahin, Ozge; Duenyas, Izak			Dynamic Pricing of Substitutable Products in the Presence of Capacity Flexibility	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing and revenue management; dynamic pricing; capacity flexibility; inventory control; substitutable products	INVENTORY CONTROL; MULTIPLE PRODUCTS; JOINT INVENTORY; RESOURCE; DEMAND; PERCEPTIONS; STRATEGIES; DECISIONS; PROMOTION; CHOICE	Firms that offer multiple products are often susceptible to periods of inventory mismatches where one product may face shortages while the other has excess inventories. In this paper, we study a joint implementation of price- and capacity-based substitution mechanisms to alleviate the level of such inventory disparities. We consider a firm producing substitutable products via a capacity portfolio consisting of both product-dedicated and flexible resources and characterize the structure of the optimal production and pricing decisions. We then explore how changes in various problem parameters affect the optimal policy structure. We show that the availability of a flexible resource helps maintain stable price differences across products over time even though the price of each product may fluctuate over time. This result has favorable ramifications from a marketing standpoint because it suggests that even when a firm applies a dynamic pricing strategy, it may still establish consistent price positioning among multiple products if it can employ a flexible replenishment resource. We provide numerical examples for the price stabilization effect and discuss extensions of our results to a more general multiple product setting.

We focus on the role that private information about demand has on firms' ability to align their capacity decisions. When forecasts are private information, there are at most two equilibria: a complete coordination failure or a monotone equilibrium. The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally. Contrary to our theoretical predictions, we show that private demand forecasts do not have a consistently negative effect on firm profits, though capacities are more misaligned. We show that preplay communication may be more effective at increasing profits than truthful information	[Hyndman, Kyle] Maastricht Univ, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hyndman, Kyle] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75205 USA; [Kraiselburd, Santiago] Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Kraiselburd, Santiago] INCAE Business Sch, Alajuela, Costa Rica; [Watson, Noel] OPS MEND, Medford, MA 02155 USA	Hyndman, K (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, NL-6211 LM Maastricht, Netherlands.	k.hyndman@maastrichtuniversity.nl; skraiselburd@utdt.edu; nwatson@opsmend.com			National Science Foundation [SES-1025044]; Southern Methodist University; Zaragoza Logistics Center; Harvard Business School	The authors thank editor Steve Graves, an associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments, which led to a substantially improved final draft.

J	Guo, PF; Zhang, ZG				Guo, Pengfei; Zhang, Zhe George			Strategic Queueing Behavior and Its Impact on System Performance in Service Systems with the Congestion-Based Staffing Policy	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						congestion-based staffing; pricing; delay information; strategic customer	CALL-BACK OPTION; DELAY INFORMATION; CONTACT CENTERS; QUEUES; BALKING; TOLLS	We study strategic customer behavior in a multiserver stochastic service system with a congestion-based staffing (CBS) policy. With the CBS policy, the number of working servers is dynamically adjusted according to the queue length. Besides lining up for free service, customers have the option of paying a fee and getting faster service. Customers' equilibrium behavior is studied under two information scenarios: In the no information scenario, customers only know the long-term statistics, such as the expected waiting time; in the partial information scenario, customers observe the number of working servers and understand the staffing policy upon their arrival. Unlike a queueing system with a constant staffing level, a positive externality is associated with customers' joining the CBS system. Both avoid-the-crowd and follow-the-crowd customer behaviors are possible, and multiple equilibria could exist. We develop the stationary performance measures of the system by considering the customers' strategic behavior. Numerical analysis shows that information can either hurt or improve the performance of the system, depending on the staffing and pricing policy. Another important conclusion is that the system performance is more robust to setting a relatively high than a relatively low price.

J	Sapra, A; Jackson, PL				Sapra, Amar; Jackson, Peter L.			On the Equilibrium Behavior of a Supply Chain Market for Capacity	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						incentives and contracting; supply chain management; stochastic methods	LONG-TERM; CONTRACTS; PROCUREMENT; STRATEGIES; EXCHANGES; BUSINESS; OPTIONS	A capacity market is a business-to-business exchange in which equally capable suppliers compete with one another to satisfy generic orders from diverse buyers. The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights.

For simplicity, we assume that every manufacturer as well as the third party each possess a single production facility. Each manufacturer has to decide the amount of workload to be subcontracted so as to minimize the completion time of his in-house and subcontracted workloads. In an effort to provide good service to all, the third party gives priority to manufacturers whose subcontracted workload is small. This incentive scheme forces manufacturers to compete for position in the third-party processing sequence. We develop. pure Nash equilibria schedules under three distinct protocols for production.

This paper provides a brief summary of a conceptual framework that we have developed to systematize the study and identification of new business models. Our approach advocates that the key to identifying new business models is understanding the context of decision making in existing models and the associated inefficiencies. We propose a three-step approach: First, existing business models must be audited for identifying information and incentive misalignment inefficiencies that destroy value. Next, new business models can be identified by changing the context of the decision associated with the most consequential of these inefficiencies. We conjecture that four elements of the decision context are most significant: WHAT decisions are made, WHEN they are made, WHO makes them, and WHY they are made. We provide a set of idea triggers to stimulate brainstorming of new business models by changing one of these four Ws. Finally, we advise that generated business models should be analyzed and experimented with to identify the most promising ones. We close the paper by describing the design of a pedagogical program based on this framework.

J	Caro, F; Corbett, CJ; Tan, T; Zuidwijk, R				Caro, Felipe; Corbett, Charles J.; Tan, Tarkan; Zuidwijk, Rob			Double Counting in Supply Chain Carbon Footprinting	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						carbon footprint; supply chain; sustainable operations; emissions allocation	SHARED-SAVINGS CONTRACTS; MORAL HAZARD; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; INCENTIVES; TEAMS; COSTS; PARTNERSHIPS; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; TAXES	Carbon footprinting is a tool for firms to determine the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their supply chain or with a unit of final product or service. Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics-and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.

Their responses vary widely. We theorize and empirically identify several factors associated with suppliers being especially willing to share this information with buyers, focusing on attributes of the buyers seeking this information and of the suppliers being asked to provide it. We test our hypotheses using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Program, a collaboration of multinational corporations requesting such information from thousands of suppliers in 49 countries. We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations. We find evidence that these factors also influence the comprehensiveness of the information suppliers share and their willingness to share the information publicly.

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy. We also find that curtailing intermittent generation often leads to system emission reductions.

Although previous studies have tried to explain the underinvestment, we focus on how the way in which a portfolio of opportunities is presented in a list affects adoption decisions. We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17% from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms. We also observe a choice overload effect at the portfolio level, but the magnitude of this effect is small.

Dynamic Capacity Investment with Two Competing Technologies	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainable operations; dynamic capacity investment; technology choice	SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY; EXPANSION; REPLACEMENT; MARKETS	With the recent focus on sustainability, firms making adjustments to their production or distribution capacity levels often have the option of investing in newer technologies with lower carbon footprints and/or energy consumption. These more sustainable technologies typically require a higher up-front investment but have lower operating (fuel or energy) costs. What complicates this decision is the fact that the projected dollar savings from the more sustainable technologies fluctuate considerably due to uncertainty in fuel prices, and the total capacity may not be utilized at 100% because of fluctuations in the demand for the product. We consider the firm's capacity adjustments over time given a portfolio of technology options when the demand and the fuel costs are stochastic and possibly dependent. Our model also allows for usage-based capacity deterioration. We provide the analytical structure of the optimal policy, which assigns different control limits for investing, staying put, and disinvesting in the capacities of the competing technology choices for each realization of demand and fuel costs at each period. We also present an application of our model to the problem of designing a delivery truck fleet for a beverage distributor.

On the Value of Input Efficiency, Capacity Efficiency, and the Flexibility to Rebalance Them	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						energy efficiency; process improvement; flexibility; environment	INVESTMENT; PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGY; OPERATIONS; WASTE	A common characteristic of basic material manufacturers (which account for 85% of all industrial energy use) and of cleantech manufacturers is that they are price takers in their input and output markets. Variability in those prices has implications for how much a manufacturer should invest in three fundamental types of process improvement. Input price variability reduces the value of improving input efficiency (output produced per unit input) but increases that of capacity efficiency (the rate at which a production facility can convert input into output). Output price variability increases the value of capacity efficiency, but it increases the value of input efficiency if and only if the expected margin is small. Moreover, as the expected input cost rises, the value of input efficiency decreases. A third type of process improvement is to develop flexibility in input efficiency versus capacity efficiency (the ability to respond to a rise in input cost or fall in output price by increasing input efficiency at the expense of capacity efficiency). The value of this flexibility decreases with variability in input and output prices if and only if the expected margin is thin. Together, these results suggest that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system may reduce investment by basic material manufacturers in improving energy efficiency.

J	Agrawal, VV; Ulku, S				Agrawal, Vishal V.; Uelkue, Sezer			The Role of Modular Upgradability as a Green Design Strategy	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						modularity; green product design; sustainability; new product development; sustainable operations	PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE; INNOVATION; MONOPOLY	Modular upgradability has been suggested as a strategy for improving environmental performance: as technology improves, it allows for independent replacement of improving subsystems, instead of replacing the entire product. This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firm's development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and considering the product's environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement. However, we also find that accelerated obsolescence, under some conditions, can actually make modular upgradability greener.

Specifically, we determine under what market and regulatory conditions an NGO should target the industry versus the regulatory body to influence firms to replace the substance. We examine how the NGO's strategy changes as the NGO's pragmatism (i.e., the extent to which the NGO incorporates firms' profits into its decision making) increases. Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry and the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGO's activism. We show that the potential for a firm to lobby can benefit consumers by motivating the NGO to exert more effort and increase the market sensitivity to a substance, thereby forcing the firm to replace.

Plant Networks for Processing Recyclable Materials	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						recycling; material versatility; localization; minimills; operations strategy; plant networks; optimal market area	LOOP SUPPLY CHAIN; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; FLEXIBILITY; OPERATIONS; STRATEGY; PRODUCT; RESOURCES; DESIGN; COST; LINK	We use a modified optimal market area model to examine how links between material recycling and other aspects of operations strategy can shape plant networks for the processing of recyclable materials. We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling-and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy.

J	Drake, DF; Spinler, S				Drake, David F.; Spinler, Stefan			Sustainable Operations Management: An Enduring Stream or a Passing Fancy?	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainable operations management; sustainability; environment; Paul Kleindorfer	EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; SPECIAL-ISSUE; SYSTEMS; LEGISLATION; TECHNOLOGY; POLICIES; MARKET	Paul Kleindorfer was among the first to weigh in on and nurture the stream of sustainable operations management. The thoughts laid out here are based on conversations we had with Paul relating to the drivers underlying sustainability as a management issue: population and per capita consumption growth, the limited nature of resources and sinks, and the responsibility and exposure of firms to ensuing ecological risks and costs. We then discuss how an operations management lens contributes to the issue and criteria to help the sustainable operations management perspective endure. This paper relates to a presentation delivered by Morris Cohen for Paul's Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Distinguished Fellows Award, given at Columbia University, June 18, 2012. We wrote this paper at Paul's request.

J	Li, HM; Armbruster, D; Kempf, KG				Li, Hongmin; Armbruster, Dieter; Kempf, Karl G.			A Population-Growth Model for Multiple Generations of Technology Products	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product transitions; forecasting; multiple-generation demand model; diffusion	SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS; DIFFUSION; SUBSTITUTION; DYNAMICS; INNOVATIONS; VARIABLES; DURABLES; ADOPTION; INDUSTRY; DEMAND	In this paper, we consider the demand for multiple, successive generations of products and develop a population-growth model that allows demand transitions across multiple product generations and takes into consideration the effect of competition. We propose an iterative-descent method for obtaining the parameter estimates and the covariance matrix, and we show that the method is theoretically sound and overcomes the difficulty that the units-in-use population of each product is not observable. We test the model on both simulated sales data and Inters high-end desktop processor sales data. We use two alternative specifications for product strength in this market: performance and performance/price ratio. The former demonstrates better fit and forecast accuracy, likely due to the low price sensitivity of this high-end market. In addition, the parameter estimate suggests that, for the innovators in the diffusion of product adoption, brand switchings are more strongly influenced by product strength than within-brand product upgrades in this market. Our results indicate that compared with the Bass model, Norton-Bass model, and Jun-Park choice-based diffusion model, our approach is a better fit for strategic forecasting that occurs many months or years before the actual product launch.

We construct a fluid model of patient triage in a mass-casualty incident that incorporates these factors and characterize its optimal policy. We use this characterization to obtain useful insights about the type of simple policies that have a good chance to perform well in practice, and we demonstrate how one could develop such a policy. Using a realistic simulation model and data from emergency medicine literature, we show that the policy we developed based on our fluid formulation outperforms START in all scenarios considered, sometimes substantially.

We assume consumer-driven, dynamic, stockout-based substitution and random proportions of each type. No efficient method to obtain the optimal solution for this problem is known to our knowledge. However, if the number of customers of each type is a fixed proportion of demand, there exists an efficient algorithm for solving for the optimal assortment. We show that the fixed proportions model gives an upper bound to the optimal expected profit for the random proportions model. This bound allows us to obtain a measure of the absolute performance of heuristic solutions. We also provide a bound for the component-wise absolute difference in expected sales between the two models, which is asymptotically tight as the inventory vector is made large, while keeping the number of products fixed. This result provides us with a lower bound to the optimal expected profit and a performance guarantee for the fixed proportions solution in the random proportions model.

Given limited display capacity and no a priori information on consumers' utility, the retailer must select which subset of products to offer. By offering different assortments and observing the resulting purchase behavior, the retailer learns about consumer preferences, but this experimentation should be balanced with the goal of maximizing revenues. We develop a family of dynamic policies that judiciously balance the aforementioned trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and prove that their performance cannot be improved upon in a precise mathematical sense. One salient feature of these policies is that they "quickly" recognize, and hence limit experimentation on, strictly suboptimal products.

J	Ramdas, K; Williams, J; Lipson, M				Ramdas, Kamalini; Williams, Jonathan; Lipson, Marc			Can Financial Markets Inform Operational Improvement Efforts? Evidence from the Airline Industry	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						econometric analysis; empirical research; service operations; quality management; OM-finance interface	EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; SERVICE QUALITY; PRICES; PERFORMANCE; RETURNS; MODELS; IMPACT; DELAYS; RISK	We investigate whether stock price movements can inform operations managers as to where they should focus improvement efforts. We examine how unexpected performance along several dimensions of service quality-on-time performance, long delays and cancellations, lost bags, and denied boardings-impacts contemporaneous stock returns. Prior research suggests that airlines buffer their flight schedules and engage in expensive employee incentive programs to increase the likelihood of on-time arrival. We find that only long delays are penalized by the market, and we identify a number of carrier-specific factors that alter the financial impact of long delays. We find that the penalty a carrier faces for long delays is significantly higher if it operates a high percentage of short-haul or connecting flights, or if its competitors incur fewer long delays in the same time period. Our findings suggest that developing ways to curtail long delays is a useful future research area.

We consider this question for a queueing system with two customer types and provide the following results. First, we develop a novel problem formulation and solution method that combines the achievable region approach with mechanism design. This approach extends to menu design problems for other systems. Second, the work conserving c mu priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A strategic delay policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies. Third, we identify general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal strategic delay: a price, a lead-time, and a segment-size condition. We translate these into demand and capacity parameter conditions for cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous valuations for each type. In some cases strategic delay is optimal if capacity is relatively abundant, in others if it is relatively scarce.

It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context.

M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity planning and investment; incentives and contracting; risk management; supply chain management	RESERVATION CONTRACTS; INVESTMENT; INFORMATION	Motivated by the dual-sourcing and contracting practices in the semiconductor industry, we study two prevailing types of contracts that deal with horizontal-capacity-coordination issues between two possible sources: an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and a foundry IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under a-contracts, a fixed fraction a of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDM's expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection. Our analysis offers supporting rationale for the coexistence of a-contracts and reservation contracts in practice and provides insights on horizontal capacity coordination beyond the semiconductor industry	[Wu, Xiaole] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Kouvelis, Panos] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Matsuo, Hirofumi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan	Wu, XL (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.	wuxiaole@fudan.edu.cn; kouvelis@wustl.edu; matsuoh@kobe-u.ac.jp			National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201036]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [22530362]	The authors are grateful to the editor-in-chief, the associate editor, and the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions that significantly improved this paper.

J	Sosa, ME; Mihm, J; Browning, TR				Sosa, Manuel E.; Mihm, Juergen; Browning, Tyson R.			Linking Cyclicality and Product Quality	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product architecture; cycles; modularity; iterative problem solving; defects	MIRRORING HYPOTHESIS; ENGINEERING DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; MODEL; ARCHITECTURE; INFORMATION; COMPLEXITY; MODULARITY; ITERATION	This paper examines the impact of architectural decisions on the level of defects in a product. We view products as collections of components linked together to work as an integrated whole. Previous work has established modularity (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and cyclicality (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components). We find cyclicality to be a determinant of quality that is distinct from, and no less important than, modularity. Extending this main result, we show how the cyclicality quality relationship is affected by the centrality of a component in a cycle and the distribution of a cycle across product modules. These findings, which are based on an analysis of open source software development projects, have implications for the study and design of complex systems.

However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing.

The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firm's cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal. Moreover, we find that hedging may lead to inventory reduction in multiperiod problems. Thus the insights from the single-period studies in the literature hedging leads to inventory increase do not apply. Finally, insights are offered on the role and impact of inventory and financial hedge on profitability, variance control, and service level, using both analytical and numerical results.

J	Whitt, W				Whitt, Ward			Offered Load Analysis for Staffing	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						offered load analysis; capacity planning; server staffing; time-varying arrival rates; infinite-server queues	TIME-VARYING DEMAND; QUEUES	This essay, based on my 2012 MSOM Fellow Lecture, discusses an idea that has been useful for developing effective methods to set staffing levels in service systems: offered load analysis. The main idea is to tackle a hard problem by first seeking an insightful simplification. For capacity planning to meet uncertain exogenous demand, offered load analysis looks at the amount of capacity that would be used if there were no constraints on its availability. This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems. Given the distribution of the stochastic offered load, we often can set staffing levels to stabilize performance at target levels, even in face of a strongly time-varying arrival rate, long service times, and network structure.

S. government has mandated that, in a catastrophic event, metropolitan areas need to be capable of caring for 50 burn-injured patients per million population. In New York City, this corresponds to 400 patients. There are currently 140 burn beds in the region, which can be surged up to 210. To care for additional patients, hospitals without burn centers will be used to stabilize patients until burn beds become available. In this work, we develop a new system for prioritizing patients for transfer to burn beds as they become available and demonstrate its superiority over several other triage methods. Based on data from previous burn catastrophes, we study the feasibility of being able to admit 400 patients to burn beds within the critical three- to five-day time frame. We find that this is unlikely and that the ability to do so is highly dependent on the type of event and the demographics of the patient population. This work has implications for how disaster plans in other metropolitan areas should be developed.

J	Rajagopalan, S				Rajagopalan, Sampath			Impact of Variety and Distribution System Characteristics on Inventory Levels at U.S. Retailers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						retailing; empirical research; econometric analysis; supply chain management; inventory	TURNOVER PERFORMANCE; SUPERMARKET INDUSTRY; PRODUCT VARIETY; QUALITY; RISK; COMPETITION; DESIGN	Over the past six decades, numerous analytical models have been developed to determine optimal inventory levels. These models predict that inventories carried by a retailer should be a function of the product variety carried by the retailer, distribution system characteristics, economies of scale, etc. A few recent empirical studies have explored the impact of some of these factors on aggregate inventories at U. S. retailers. Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U. S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels. Increased demand fluctuations are also associated with higher inventories, although the effects are less robust. The significant variables together with retailer segment identifiers explain a substantial fraction of the variance in inventory levels and can be potentially useful to managers in benchmarking their inventory levels.

A Dispatching Model for Server-to-Customer Systems That Balances Efficiency and Equity	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						emergency medical services; server-to-customer systems; public health; equity; Markov decision processes; linear programming	HOSPITAL CARDIAC-ARREST; FIRE COMPANIES; SERVICES; PERFORMANCE; UNITS	The decision about which servers to dispatch to which customers is an important aspect of service systems. This decision is complicated when servers must be equitably-as well as efficiently-dispatched to customers. In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival. Four types of equity constraints are considered-two of which reflect customer equity and two of which reflect server equity-all of which draw upon the decision analytic and social science literature to compare the effects of different notions of equity on the resulting dispatching policies. The Markov decision processes are formulated as equity-constrained linear programming models. A computational example is applied to an EMS system to compare the different equity models.

The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers. We show that the mechanisms can be efficiently computed and highlight the impact of the improved sharing of surface water. We also study the movement of the price of water with its scarcity. Ideas that can help administer the mechanisms in practice are briefly discussed.

In this paper, we consider a facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments. Whereas most existing models in the literature implicitly assume that the disruption probability estimate is perfectly accurate, we investigate the impact of misestimating the disruption probability. Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability. Thus, managers should focus more on accurately estimating the disruption probability than the correlation.

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.

In contrast, in this paper we study canonical service models with boundedly rational customers. We capture bounded rationality using a model in which customers are incapable of accurately estimating their expected waiting time. We investigate the impact of bounded rationality from both a profit-maximizing firm's perspective and a social planner's perspective. For visible queues with the optimal price, bounded rationality results in revenue and welfare loss; with a fixed price, bounded rationality can lead to strict social welfare improvement. For invisible queues, bounded rationality benefits the firm when its level is sufficiently high. Ignoring bounded rationality, when present yet small, can result in significant revenue and welfare loss.

Emergency jobs need to be served immediately, whereas elective jobs can wait. Distributional information about demand and resource availability is continually updated, and we allow jobs to renege. We prove that our formulation is convex, and the optimal amount of capacity reserved for emergency jobs in each period decreases with the number of elective jobs waiting for service. However, the optimal policy is difficult to compute exactly. We develop the idea of a limit policy starting at a particular time, and use this policy to obtain upper and lower bounds on the decisions of an optimal policy in each period, and also to develop several computationally efficient policies. We show in computational experiments that our best policy performs within 1.8% of an optimal policy on average.

J	Afeche, P; Ata, B				Afeche, Philipp; Ata, Baris			Bayesian Dynamic Pricing in Queueing Systems with Unknown Delay Cost Characteristics	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bayesian learning; delay; dynamic pricing; revenue management; queueing	DEMAND DISTRIBUTION; INVENTORY MODELS; EXPERIMENTATION; POLICIES	The revenue management literature for queues typically assumes that providers know the distribution of customer demand attributes. We study an observable M/M/1 queue that serves an unknown proportion of patient and impatient customers. The provider has a Bernoulli prior on this proportion, corresponding to an optimistic or pessimistic scenario. For every queue length, she chooses a low or a high price, or turns customers away. Only the high price is informative. The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure. The optimal Bayesian pricing policy as a function of queue length has a zone (or, nested-threshold) structure. Moreover, the price convergence under the optimal Bayesian policy is sensitive to the system size, i.e., the maximum queue length. We identify two cases: prices converge (1) almost surely to the optimal prices in either scenario or (2) with positive probability to suboptimal prices. Only Case 2 is consistent with the typical incomplete learning outcome observed in the literature.

J	Cho, SH; Tang, CS				Cho, Soo-Haeng; Tang, Christopher S.			Advance Selling in a Supply Chain Under Uncertain Supply and Demand	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						game theory; healthcare management; supply chain management	QUICK RESPONSE; DECISIONS; CONTRACTS; COST	We examine three selling strategies of a manufacturer who produces and sells a seasonal product to a retailer under uncertain supply and demand: (1) advance selling-presells the product before observing uncertain supply and demand; (2) regular selling-sells the product after supply and demand are realized; and (3) dynamic selling-combines both advance and regular selling strategies. We model the first two strategies as single-period Stackelberg games, and we model the last strategy as a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental-the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental-the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer.

J	Chu, LY; Lai, GM				Chu, Leon Yang; Lai, Guoming			Salesforce Contracting Under Demand Censorship	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						salesforce contracting; demand censorship; newsvendor	LIMITED-LIABILITY; COMPENSATION PLANS; MORAL HAZARD; HETEROGENEOUS SALESFORCES; INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; NEWSVENDOR PROBLEM; LOST SALES; INFORMATION; PRINCIPAL; AGENT	We study salesforce contracting in an environment where excess demand results in lost sales and the demand information is censored by the inventory level. In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level. The agent earns zero rent in the additive effort case but may earn a positive rent in the multiplicative effort case. Finally, our numerical analysis shows that demand censorship can have a significant negative impact on the value of contracting with the sales agent, especially when the sales margin is low and the market uncertainty is high.
