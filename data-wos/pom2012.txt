The competing viewpoints and the asymmetric nature of market returns associated with these goals in R&D projects can heighten stress levels among project team members and reduce their psychological safety. While current research calls for greater focus on task design for improving psychological safety, we know little about how team contextual factors affect this relationship. This study develops and tests a conceptual framework that examines the moderating role of R&D team contextual factors, namely, relative exploration and project-organization metric alignment on the relationship between a key task design variable, namely, team autonomy, and psychological safety. Relative exploration captures the extent to which exploration goals are emphasized over exploitation goals in an R&D project, while project-organization metric alignment measures the extent to which project metrics are aligned with broader organizational metrics. Furthermore, we examine the performance consequences of psychological safety in R&D projects. The empirical analysis is conducted using primary data collected from multiple informants across 110 R&D projects in 34 high technology business units. Our results indicate that relative exploration and project-organization metric alignment have contrasting moderating effects. Furthermore, the effect of psychological safety on project performance is found to be indirect and mediated through team turnover. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

J	Ryan, JK; Sun, D; Zhao, XY				Ryan, Jennifer K.; Sun, Daewon; Zhao, Xuying			Competition and Coordination in Online Marketplaces	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-Business; online marketplace; coordination; competition; game theory	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT-PROJECTS; PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; TEAM EFFECTIVENESS; WORK TEAMS; MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATION; MODERATING ROLE; EMPIRICAL-TEST; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION	Online marketplaces, such as those operated by Amazon, have seen rapid growth in recent years. These marketplaces serve as an intermediary, matching buyers with sellers, whereas control of the good is left to the seller. In some cases, e.g., the Amazon marketplace system, the firm that owns and manages the marketplace system will also sell competing products through the marketplace system. This creates a new form of channel conflict, which is a focus of this article. We consider a setting in which a marketplace firm operates an online marketplace through which retailers can sell their products directly to consumers. We consider a single retailer, who currently sells its product only through its own website, but who may choose to contract with Amazon to sell its product through the marketplace system. Selling the product through the marketplace expands the available market for the retailer, but comes at some expense, e.g., a fixed participation fee or a revenue sharing requirement. Thus, a key question for the retailer is whether she should choose to sell through the marketplace system, and if so, at what price. We analyze the optimal decisions for both the retailer and the marketplace firm and characterize the system equilibrium.

The papers dealing with this problem are mainly focused on supperadditive games, where the cost savings associated with a coalition increase with the number of players in the coalition. The most relevant question addressed then is how to allocate the savings to the players. In this paper, we propose to go further by dealing with a non-supperadditive game, where a set of independent retailers have the common understanding to share the cost savings according to the cost-based proportional rule. In this setting, the global cost optimization is no longer a relevant approach to identify appealing coalitions for any retailer. Here, we provide an iterative procedure to form the so-called efficient coalition structure and we show that this coalition structure has the nice properties of being (i) weakly stable in the sense of the coalition structure core and (ii) strongly stable under a given assumption. An exact fractional programming based solution is also given to generate such efficient coalitions.

J	Honhon, D; Gaur, V; Seshadri, S				Honhon, Dorothee; Gaur, Vishal; Seshadri, Sridhar			A Multi-Supplier Sourcing Problem with a Preference Ordering of Suppliers	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory management; procurement; supplier scorecard; multi-supplier sourcing; stockout-based substitution	INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; COST ALLOCATION; GLOBAL APPROACH; GAME; COOPERATION; COALITIONS; BENEFITS	We study a sourcing problem faced by a firm that seeks to procure a product or a component from a pool of alternative suppliers. The firm has a preference ordering of the suppliers based on factors such as their past performance, quality, service, geographical location, and financial strength, which are commonly included in a supplier scorecard system. Thus, the firm first uses available inventory from supplier 1, if any, then supplier 2, if any, and so on. The suppliers differ in costs and prices. The buyer firm seeks to determine which suppliers to purchase from and in what quantities to maximize its total expected profit subject to the preference ordering constraint. We present the optimal solution to this problem, and show that it has a portfolio structure. It consists of a sub-set of suppliers that are ordered by their underage and overage costs. This portfolio achieves a substantial profit gain compared to sourcing from a unique supplier. We present an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal solution. Our model applies to component sourcing problems in manufacturing, merchandizing problems in retailing, and capacity reservation problems in services.

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product take-back; extended producer responsibility; WEEE; competition	INVENTORY DECISIONS; RETAIL ASSORTMENTS; SUBSTITUTION; CONTRACTS; MANAGEMENT; MODELS	We investigate the implications of collective and individual producer responsibility (CPR and IPR, respectively) models of product take-back laws for e-waste on manufacturers' design for product recovery (DfR) choices and profits, and on consumer surplus in the presence of product competition. We show that IPR offers superior DfR incentives as compared to CPR, and provides a level competitive ground. CPR may distort competition and allow free-riding on DfR efforts to reduce product recovery costs. Thus, manufacturer preferences for IPR or CPR may differ because of the free-riding implications under CPR, with even high-end manufacturers having incentives to free-ride under certain competitive conditions. The policy choice between IPR and CPR is not clear cut from an economic welfare perspective. This choice involves a comparison between the effects of superior recovery cost reduction through improved DfR under IPR and the operational cost-efficiency under CPR.

Analysis of Travel Times and CO2 Emissions in Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						vehicle routing problems; time-dependent travel times; CO2 emissions; green logistics	PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY; WASTE-DISPOSAL; SOLID-WASTE; DESIGN; POLICIES; LEGISLATION	Due to the growing concern over environmental issues, regardless of whether companies are going to voluntarily incorporate green policies in practice, or will be forced to do so in the context of new legislation, change is foreseen in the future of transportation management. Assigning and scheduling vehicles to service a pre-determined set of clients is a common distribution problem. Accounting for time-dependent travel times between customers, we present a model that considers travel time, fuel, and CO2 emissions costs. Specifically, we propose a framework for modeling CO2 emissions in a time-dependent vehicle routing context. The model is solved via a tabu search procedure. As the amount of CO2 emissions is correlated with vehicle speed, our model considers limiting vehicle speed as part of the optimization. The emissions per kilometer as a function of speed are minimized at a unique speed. However, we show that in a time-dependent environment this speed is sub-optimal in terms of total emissions. This occurs if vehicles are able to avoid running into congestion periods where they incur high emissions. Clearly, considering this trade-off in the vehicle routing problem has great practical potential. In the same line, we construct bounds on the total amount of emissions to be saved by making use of the standard VRP solutions. As fuel consumption is correlated with CO2 emissions, we show that reducing emissions leads to reducing costs. For a number of experimental settings, we show that limiting vehicle speeds is desired from a total cost perspective. This namely stems from the trade-off between fuel and travel time costs.

The reseller has superior capability in demand forecasting relative to the manufacturer. We explore the main trade-offs between the risk-reduction effect and the information-asymmetry-aggravation effect of the improved forecasting accuracy. We show that under the optimal wholesale price contract, both the manufacturer and the reseller are always better off as the reseller's forecasting accuracy improves. Nevertheless, under the menu of two-part tariffs, the manufacturer prefers the reseller to be either uninformed or perfectly informed about the market condition. We further find that the improved forecasting accuracy is beneficial for the reseller if its current forecasting system is either very poor or very good.

We examine a channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, where the retailer is capital constrained. The retailer may fund its business by borrowing credit either from a competitive bank market or from the manufacturer, provided the latter is willing to lend. When only one credit type (either bank or trade credit) is viable, we show that trade credit financing generally charges a higher wholesale price and thus becomes less attractive than bank credit financing for the retailer. When both bank and trade credits are viable, the unique equilibrium is trade credit financing if production cost is relatively low but is bank credit financing otherwise. We also study the case where both the retailer and the manufacturer are capital constrained and demonstrate that, to improve the overall supply chain efficiency, the bank should finance the manufacturer if production cost is low but finance the retailer otherwise. Our analysis further suggests that the equilibrium region of trade credit financing shrinks as demand variability or the retailer's internal capital level increases.

Gray Markets, A Product of Demand Uncertainty and Excess Inventory	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						distribution channels; decisions under uncertainty; retailing and wholesale; gray markets	PARALLEL IMPORTS; SUPPLY CHAIN; POLICIES; CHANNEL	Diverting large quantities of goods from authorized distribution channels to unauthorized or gray market channels, albeit legal, significantly affects both firms and consumers due to effects on price, revenue, service and warranty availability, and product availability. In this paper we consider mechanisms by which the uncertainty surrounding inventory ordering decisions drives gray markets. We start with a minimal stochastic supply chain model composed of a producer and a retailer; then we restructure the model to add a distributor whereby the distributor and authorized retailer have the option of diverting inventory to a gray market. Our analysis sheds light on three issues: impacts of diversion on the various supply chain participants, strategies producers could use to combat or exploit gray markets, and important considerations for authorized retailers trying to set optimal order quantities in the presence of a gray market. Our analysis yields new insights into the behavior and impact of gray markets, which can inform management strategies and policies for confronting them.

Managing a Remanufacturing System with Random Yield: Properties, Observations, and Heuristics	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; random yield; optimal policy; heuristics	MYOPIC HEURISTICS; INFORMATION; PRODUCTS; POLICIES	We study a remanufacturing system that involves the ordering of a serviceable product and the remanufacturing of multiple types of returned products (cores) into the serviceable product. In addition to random demand for the serviceable product and random returned quantities of different types of cores in each time period, the remanufacturing yield of each type of core is also uncertain. By analyzing a multi-period stochastic dynamic program, we derive several properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy. In addition to some insights, these properties can be used to reduce the search effort of the optimal policy. We also demonstrate that some existing results derived from related models no longer hold in remanufacturing systems with random yield. Recognizing the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy is highly complex, we examine three simple heuristics that can be efficiently solved and implemented in practice. Among these three heuristics, our numerical analysis suggests that the heuristic that captures most of the yield uncertainty and future system evolvement as well as some of the properties of the optimal ordering/remanufacturing policy outperforms the other two heuristics.

J	Chen, LW; Gilbert, SM; Xu, XH				Chen, Liwen; Gilbert, Stephen M.; Xu, Xiaohui			The Role of Revenue-Focused Managerial Performance Measures in Supply Chain Coordination	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hold-up problem; capacity investment; promotion; strategic delegation; managerial incentives	DELEGATING PRICING DECISIONS; VERTICAL INTEGRATION; INCENTIVES; EQUILIBRIUM; INFORMATION; CONTRACTS; OLIGOPOLY; FIRM	Many firms employ revenue-focused managerial performance measures (RF-MPMs) that cause managers to worry more about revenues than about costs. Although this can seemingly misalign the interests of a manager, we show that the use of such measures can help supply chain partners to overcome hold-up issues with respect to capacity and promotion investments. We develop a game theoretic model in which two supply chain partners engage in repeated interactions in which the supplier invests in capacity and the buyer invests in demand promotion. Following the realization of demand in each period, the two firms negotiate over the output quantity and wholesale price. The novelty of our model is that we allow the owners of each firm to delegate decision-making power and negotiating responsibility to a free-agent manager. We characterize the conditions under which the owners of both firms employ RF-MPMs in equilibrium and benefit from doing so. For a special case of our model, we show that for the owners of the buyer, an RF-MPM is equivalent to a price only relational contract, and that it complements a price and quantity relational contract as a mechanism for mitigating hold-up issues.

J	Cooper, WL; Li, L				Cooper, William L.; Li, Le			On the Use of Buy Up as a Model of Customer Choice in Revenue Management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; yield management; Choice Models; misspecification	ALLOCATION; BEHAVIOR	We consider settings in which a revenue manager controls bookings over a sequence of flights. The revenue manager uses a buy-up model to select booking limits and updates estimates of the model parameters as data are accumulated. The buy-up model we consider is based upon a simple model of customer choice, wherein each low-fare customer who is not able to purchase a low-fare ticket will, with a fixed probability, buy up to the high fare, independent of everything else. We analyze the evolution of the parameter estimates (e.g., the buy-up probability) and chosen booking limits in situations where the buy-up model is misspecified, that is, in situations where there is no setting of its parameters for which its objective function gives an accurate representation of expected revenue as a function of the booking limit. The analysis is motivated by the common situation in which a revenue manager does not know precisely how customers behave but nevertheless uses a parametric model to make decisions. Under some assumptions, we prove that the booking limits and parameter estimates converge and we compare the actual expected revenue at the limiting values with that associated with the booking limits that would be chosen if the revenue manager knew the actual behavior of customers. The analysis shows that the buy-up model often works reasonably well even when it is misspecified, and also reveals the importance of understanding how parameter estimates of misspecified models vary as functions of decisions.

J	Chung, C; Niu, SC; Sriskandarajah, C				Chung, Casey; Niu, Shun-Chen; Sriskandarajah, Chelliah			A Sales Forecast Model for Short-Life-Cycle Products: New Releases at Blockbuster	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sales forecasting; retail operations; new-product diffusion; buyer behavior; DVD movies; stochastic model applications	MOTION-PICTURES; DIFFUSION; IMITATORS; INNOVATORS; DYNAMICS; MUSIC	We develop, in this article, a sales model for movie and game products at Blockbuster. The model assumes that there are three sales components: the first is from consumers who have already committed to purchasing (or renting) a product (e.g., based on promotion of, or exposure to, the product prior to its launch); the second comes from consumers who are potential buyers of the product; and the third comes from either a networking effect on closely tied (as in a social group) potential buyers from previous buyers (in the case of movie rental and all retail products) or re-rents (in the case of game rental). In addition, we explicitly formulate into our model dynamic interactions between these sales components, both within and across sales periods. This important feature is motivated by realism, and it significantly contributes to the accuracy of our model. The model is thoroughly tested against sales data for rental and retail products from Blockbuster. Our empirical results show that the model offers excellent fit to actual sales activity. We also demonstrate that the model is capable of delivering reasonable sales forecasts based solely on environmental data (e.g., theatrical sales, studio, genre, MPAA ratings, etc.) and actual first-period sales. Accurate sales forecasts can lead to significant cost savings. In particular, it can improve the retail operations at Blockbuster by determining appropriate order quantities of products, which is critical in effective inventory management (i.e., it can reduce the extent of over-stocking and under-stocking). While our model is developed specifically for product sales at Blockbuster, we believe that with context-dependent modifications, our modeling approach could also provide a reasonable basis for the study of sales for other short-Life-Cycle products.

Appointment Overbooking in Health Care Clinics to Improve Patient Service and Clinic Performance	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; appointment scheduling; overbooking	SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; DESIGN	The problem of no-shows (patients who do not arrive for scheduled appointments) is particularly significant for health care clinics, with reported no-show rates varying widely from 3% to 80%. No-shows reduce revenues and provider productivity, increase costs, and limit patient access by reducing effective clinic capacity. In this article, we construct a flexible appointment scheduling model to mitigate the detrimental effects of patient no-shows, and develop a fast and effective solution procedure that constructs near-optimal overbooked appointment schedules that balance the benefits of serving additional patients with the potential costs of patient waiting and clinic overtime. Computational results demonstrate the efficacy of our model and solution procedure, and connect our work to prior research in health care appointment scheduling.

J	Pourakbar, M; Frenk, JBG; Dekker, R				Pourakbar, M.; Frenk, J. B. G.; Dekker, R.			End-of-Life Inventory Decisions for Consumer Electronics Service Parts	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service parts; end-of-Life inventory control; consumer electronics	FINAL ORDER PROBLEM; CYCLE; PRODUCT; BUY	We consider a consumer electronics manufacturer's problem of controlling the inventory of spare parts in the final phase of the service life cycle. The final phase starts when the part production is terminated and continues until the last service contract or warranty period expires. Placing final orders for service parts is considered to be a popular tactic to satisfy demand during this period and to mitigate the effect of part obsolescence at the end of the service life cycle. Previous research focuses on repairing defective products by replacing the defective parts with properly functioning spare ones. However, for consumer electronic products there typically is considerable price erosion while repair costs stay steady over time. As a consequence, there might be a point in time at which the unit price of the product drops below the repair costs. If so, it is more cost effective to adopt an alternative policy to meet service demands toward the end of the final phase, such as offering customers a new product of the similar type or a discount on a next generation product. This study examines the cost trade-offs of implementing alternative policies for the repair policy and develops an exact expression for the expected total cost function. Using this expression, the optimal final order quantity and switching time from repair to an alternative policy can be determined simultaneously. Numerical analysis of a real world case sheds light on the cost benefits of these policies and also yields insights into the quantitative importance of the various cost parameters.

J	Chen, YJ; Shum, S; Xiao, WQ				Chen, Ying-Ju; Shum, Stephen; Xiao, Wenqiang			Should an OEM Retain Component Procurement when the CM Produces Competing Products?	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						buy-sell; price masking; turnkey; information asymmetry	COUNTERVAILING INCENTIVES; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; PARTICIPATION; COORDINATION; MECHANISMS; CONTRACTS; SUPPLIER; POLICY	We consider a large original equipment manufacturer (OEM) who relies on a contract manufacturer (CM) to produce her product. In addition to the OEM's product, the CM also produces for a smaller OEM. Both the larger OEM and the CM can purchase the component from the supplier, but their purchase prices may differ and remain unknown to each other. The main question we address is whether the larger OEM should retain component procurement by purchasing components from the supplier and reselling to the CM (buysell), or outsource component procurement by letting the CM purchase directly from the supplier (turnkey). We show that, under buysell, the larger OEM's optimal strategy is to resell components at the highest possible component purchase price of the CM (i.e., the street price). By comparing buysell and turnkey, we find that a CM with low component price is better off under turnkey, even though under buysell he receives more profits through the products sold to the smaller OEM. Furthermore, the larger OEM's preference between buysell and turnkey depends on her component price, the volatility of the CM's component price and substitutability between the two products.

J	Ardalan, A; Diaz, R				Ardalan, Alireza; Diaz, Rafael			An Evaluation of the NERJIT Priority Rule in a Kanban-Controlled Flowshop	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Just-In-Time; flowshops; priority rule; simulation	JUST-IN-TIME; BUILD-TO-ORDER; SUPPLY CHAIN; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; JIT PHILOSOPHY; DEMAND CHAIN; PULL SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT	Significant progress in production and information technologies and innovations in management of operations during the last couple of decades have made the production of small lots and deployment of Just-In-Time (JIT) concepts in flowshops possible. As a result, some researchers and practitioners have been seeking to improve the performance of non-repetitive systems using JIT concepts. In this process, the JIT concepts that were originally designed for mass production have been modified to adapt JIT to non-repetitive systems. This article uses a priority rule that is based on real-time demand and production information for sequencing jobs in a kanban-controlled flowshop. The analysis of the effect of this priority rule; the number of kanbans; the length of the withdrawal cycle; First-Come, First-Served (FCFS); and Shortest Processing Time (SPT) on four performance measurescustomer wait time, total inventory, input stock-point inventory, and output stock-point inventory, shows that the use of this priority rule results in a significant reduction of customer wait time and a slight decrease in inventory.

Workload Control and Order Release: A Lean Solution for Make-to-Order Companies	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						workload control; order release; lean; make-to-order	ORIENTED MANUFACTURING CONTROL; JOB-SHOP ENVIRONMENT; CONTROL WLC; MECHANISMS; TIME; REVIEW/RELEASE; PERFORMANCE; PARAMETERS; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS	Protecting throughput from variance is the key to achieving lean. Workload control (WLC) accomplishes this in complex make-to-order job shops by controlling lead times, capacity, and work-in-process (WIP). However, the concept has been dismissed by many authors who believe its order release mechanism reduces the effectiveness of shop floor dispatching and increases work center idleness, thereby also increasing job tardiness results. We show that these problems have been overcome. A WLC order release method known as LUMS OR (Lancaster University Management School order release) combines continuous with periodic release, allowing the release of work to be triggered between periodic releases if a work center is starving. This paper refines the method based on the literature (creating LUMS COR [Lancaster University Management School corrected order release]) before comparing its performance against the best-performing purely periodic and continuous release rules across a range of flow directions, from the pure job shop to the general flow shop. Results demonstrate that LUMS COR and the continuous WLC release methods consistently outperform purely periodic release and Constant WIP. LUMS COR is considered the best solution in practice due to its excellent performance and ease of implementation. Findings have significant implications for research and practice: throughput times and job tardiness results can be improved simultaneously and order release and dispatching rules can complement each other. Thus, WLC represents an effective means of implementing lean principles in a make-to-order context.

The need to jointly price the services assumes significance because they are partial substitutes of one another. Our study finds that the influence of the logistics network on prices is especially strong when there are non-linearities in the cost of provisioning the logistics services. Furthermore, the impact of logistics decisions on different types of pricing schemes (e.g., volume discount, bundled pricing) is different, both in its structure and extent. In present times, when the market for the fit-sorting service is relatively immature, our findings have major implications to the way an SLP's business is managed.

We explore this trade-off by examining the production quantity and cost reducing R&D investment decisions in a two period model wherein a startup firm must make a minimum level of profit at the end of the first period to survive and operate in the second period. We specify a probabilistic survival measure as a function of production and investment decisions to track and manage the risk exposure of the startup depending on three key market factors: technology, demand, and competitor's cost. We develop managerial insights by characterizing how to create operational hedges against the bankruptcy risk: if a startup makes a conservative investment decision, then it also selects an optimal quantity that is less than the monopoly level and hence sacrifices some of first period expected profits to increase its survival chances. If it decides to invest aggressively, then it produces more than the monopoly level to cover the higher bankruptcy risk. We also illustrate that debt constraint shrinks the decision space, wherein such process investments are viable.

J	Bendoly, E; Bharadwaj, A; Bharadwaj, S				Bendoly, Elliot; Bharadwaj, Anandhi; Bharadwaj, Sundar			Complementary Drivers of New Product Development Performance: Cross-Functional Coordination, Information System Capability, and Intelligence Quality	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						new product development; enterprise resource planning; cross-functional coordination; intelligence; market dynamics	RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MARKET ORIENTATION; SUCCESS FACTORS; KNOWLEDGE; TECHNOLOGY; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK	Coordination efforts that access and align relevant cross-functional expertise are regarded as an essential element of innovation success. In recent years, these efforts have been further augmented through complementary investments in information systems, which provide the technological platforms for information sharing and coordination across functional and organizational boundaries. Somewhat overlooked has been the critical mediating role of the intelligence gained through these efforts and capabilities. This study draws on the theory of complementarity to elaborate on the nature of this mediating concept. Theoretical predictions of the model are tested using instrument variable regression analysis of data collected from a sample of publicly traded US manufacturing firms. The findings suggest that the effects of both internal and external coordination on market intelligence and supply-chain intelligence are moderated by the firm's information system capability. The effect of both types of intelligence quality on new product development performance was contingent with the effects being enhanced (attenuated) when the market conditions were dynamic (stable). The results are robust to common-method bias, endogeneity concerns, and alternative estimation methods.

A Production-Inventory Model for a Push-Pull Manufacturing System with Capacity and Service Level Constraints	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						push; pull-production; configure-to-order; inventory control; capacitated model; demand skew	LIMITED PRODUCTION CAPACITY; TO-ORDER SYSTEMS; UNCERTAIN DEMANDS; COST CRITERION; POSTPONEMENT; INFORMATION	We study a hybrid pushpull production system with a two-stage manufacturing process, which builds and stocks tested components for just-in-time configuration of the final product when a specific customer order is received. The first production stage (fabrication) is a push process where parts are replenished, tested, and assembled into components according to product-level build plans. The component inventory is kept in stock ready for the final assembly of the end products. The second production stage (fulfillment) is a pull-based assemble-to-order process where the final assembly process is initiated when a customer order is received and no finished goods inventory is kept for end products. One important planning issue is to find the right trade-off between capacity utilization and inventory cost reduction that strives to meet the quarter-end peak demand. We present a nonlinear optimization model to minimize the total inventory cost subject to the service level constraints and the production capacity constraints. This results in a convex program with linear constraints. An efficient algorithm using decomposition is developed for solving the nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical results are presented to show the performance improvements achieved by the optimized solutions along with managerial insights provided.

J	Cayirli, T; Yang, KK; Quek, SA				Cayirli, Tugba; Yang, Kum Khiong; Quek, Ser Aik			A Universal Appointment Rule in the Presence of No-Shows and Walk-Ins	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						healthcare; appointment scheduling; simulation; nonlinear regression	SINGLE-SERVER SYSTEM; HEALTH-CARE; CUSTOMER ARRIVALS; SERVICE SYSTEM; OVERBOOKING; SIMULATION; RADIOLOGY; RESOURCE; DESIGN; MODEL	This study introduces a universal Dome appointment rule that can be parameterized through a planning constant for different clinics characterized by the environmental factorsno-shows, walk-ins, number of appointments per session, variability of service times, and cost of doctor's time to patients time. Simulation and nonlinear regression are used to derive an equation to predict the planning constant as a function of the environmental factors. We also introduce an adjustment procedure for appointment systems to explicitly minimize the disruptive effects of no-shows and walk-ins. The procedure adjusts the mean and standard deviation of service times based on the expected probabilities of no-shows and walk-ins for a given target number of patients to be served, and it is thus relevant for any appointment rule that uses the mean and standard deviation of service times to construct an appointment schedule. The results show that our Dome rule with the adjustment procedure performs better than the traditional rules in the literature, with a lower total system cost calculated as a weighted sum of patients waiting time, doctor's idle time, and doctor's overtime. An open-source decision-support tool is also provided so that healthcare managers can easily develop appointment schedules for their clinical environment.

Designing Service Level Contracts for Supply Chain Coordination	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service level; contracts; supply chain; financial penalty	INFORMATION ASYMMETRY; DELIVERY	Supply contracts are used to coordinate the activities of the supply chain partners. In many industries, service level-based supply contracts are commonly used. Under such a contract, a company agrees to achieve a certain service level and to pay a financial penalty if it misses it. The service level used in our study refers to the fraction of a manufacturer's demand filled by the supplier. We analyze two types of service level-based supply contracts that are designed by a manufacturer and offered to a supplier. The first type of contract is a flat penalty contract, under which the supplier pays a fixed penalty to the manufacturer in each period in which the contract service level is not achieved. The second type of contract is a unit penalty contract, under which a penalty is due for each unit delivered fewer than specified by the parameters of the contract. We show how the supplier responds to the contracts and how the contract parameters can be chosen, such that the supply chain is coordinated. We also derive structural results about optimal values of the contract parameters, provide numerical results, and connect our service level measures to traditional service level measures. The results of our analyses can be used by decision makers to design optimal service level contracts and to provide them with a solid foundation for contract negotiations.

J	Shu, J; Barton, R				Shu, Jun; Barton, Russell			Managing Supply Chain Execution: Monitoring Timeliness and Correctness via Individualized Trace Data	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain behavior visibility monitoring	INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; ALGORITHM; ALIGNMENT	Improvements in information technologies provide new opportunities to control and improve business processes based on real-time performance data. A class of data we call individualized trace data (ITD) identifies the real-time status of individual entities as they move through execution processes, such as an individual product passing through a supply chain or a uniquely identified mortgage application going through an approval process. We develop a mathematical framework which we call the State-Identity-Time (SIT) Framework to represent and manipulate ITD at multiple levels of aggregation for different managerial purposes. Using this framework, we design a pair of generic quality measurestimeliness and correctnessfor the progress of entities through a supply chain. The timeliness and correctness metrics provide behavioral visibility that can help managers to grasp the dynamics of supply chain behavior that is distinct from asset visibility such as inventory. We develop special quality control methods using this framework to address the issue of overreaction that is common among managers faced with a large volume of fast-changing data. The SIT structure and its associated methods inform managers on if, when, and where to react. We illustrate our approach using simulations based on real RFID data from a Walmart RFID pilot project.

J	Li, KP; Mallik, S; Chhajed, D				Li, Kunpeng; Mallik, Suman; Chhajed, Dilip			Design of Extended Warranties in Supply Chains under Additive Demand	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						extended warranty; supply chain management; warranty; game theory	SERVICE CONTRACTS; PRODUCT; INSURANCE; INVENTORY; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; QUALITY; COSTS	We study the design of extended warranties in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an independent retailer. The manufacturer produces a single product and sells it exclusively through the retailer. The extended warranty can be offered either by the manufacturer or by the retailer. The party offering the extended warranty decides on the terms of the policy in its best interest and incurs the repair costs of product failures. We use game theoretic models to answer the following questions. Which scenario leads to a higher supply-chain profit, the retailer offering the extended warranty or the manufacturer? How do the optimum price and extended warranty length vary under different scenarios? We find that, depending on the parameters, either party may provide better extended warranty policies and generate more system profit. We also compare these two decentralized models with a centralized system where a single party manufactures the product, sells it to the consumer, and offers the extended warranty. We also consider an extension of our basic model where either the manufacturer or the retailer resells the extended warranty policies of a third party (e.g., an independent insurance company), instead of offering its own policy.

J	Li, L; Jiang, L; Liu, LM				Li, Li; Jiang, Li; Liu, Liming			Service and Price Competition When Customers Are Naive	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						queues; customer behavior; price and service rate competition; two-stage game	QUEUES; PERFORMANCE; ALLOCATION; SYSTEM	We consider a system of two service providers each with a separate queue. Customers choose one queue to join upon arrival and can switch between queues in real time before entering service to maximize their spot utility, which is a function of price and queue length. We characterize the steady-state distribution for queue lengths, and then investigate a two-stage game in which the two service providers first simultaneously select service rates and then simultaneously charge prices. Our results indicate that neither service provider will have both a faster service and a lower price than its competitor. When price plays a less significant role in customers service selection relative to queue length or when the two service providers incur comparable costs for building capacities, they will not engage in price competition. When price plays a significant role and the capacity costs at the service providers sufficiently differ, they will adopt substitutable competition instruments: the lower cost service provider will build a faster service and the higher cost service provider will charge a lower price. Comparing our results to those in the existing literature, we find that the service providers invest in lower service rates, engage in less intense price competition, and earn higher profits, while customers wait in line longer when they are unable to infer service rates and are naive in service selection than when they can infer service rates to make sophisticated choices. The customers jockeying behavior further lowers the service providers capacity investment and lengthens the customers duration of stay.

Our objective is to maximize the production rate. We identify optimal server assignment policies for systems with three stations, two servers, different flexibility structures, and either deterministic service times and arbitrary buffers or exponential service times and small buffers. We use these policies to develop server assignment heuristics for Markovian systems with larger buffer sizes that appear to yield near-optimal throughput. In the deterministic setting, we prove that the best possible production rate with full server flexibility and infinite buffers can be attained with partial flexibility and zero buffers, and we identify the critical skills required to achieve this goal. We then present numerical results showing that these critical skills, employed with an effective server assignment policy, also yield near-optimal throughput in the Markovian setting, even for small buffer sizes. Thus, our results suggest that partial flexibility is sufficient for near-optimal performance, and that flexibility structures that are effective for deterministic and infinite-buffered systems are also likely to perform well for finite-buffered stochastic systems.

Early Sales of Seasonal Products with Weather-Conditional Rebates	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						conditional rebates; seasonal products; weather-conditional promotions	ADVANCE-PURCHASE DISCOUNTS; SUPPLY CHAIN PROFITS; PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; UNCERTAINTY; CHANNEL; REGRET; ALLOCATION; PROMOTIONS; RETAILER; CAPACITY	Some retailers of seasonal products adopt weather-conditional rebate programs to induce early sales and increase profits. In such promotions, customers who buy the product in an advance preselling period are offered rebates if a pre-specified weather condition is realized during the later normal selling season. We investigate the potential benefits of these programs for retailers. We show that the weather-conditional rebate program can increase sales by price discriminating among a customer's post-purchase states. Taking advantage of the early sales, it can also reduce the inventory holding cost and ordering cost, and hence can increase the retailer's expected profits. In addition, we numerically investigate the sensitivity of the rebate program's effectiveness to the model parameters and illustrate its advantages over an advance-discount policy.

An Operations Perspective on Product Take-Back Legislation for E-Waste: Theory, Practice, and Research Needs	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						waste electrical and electronic equipment; product take-back; recycling; electronics	SOLID-WASTE; POLICIES; DESIGN; RESPONSIBILITY; DISPOSAL; CHOICE	Agrowing stream of environmental legislation enforces collection and recycling of used electrical and electronics products. Based on our experiences with producers coping with e-waste legislation, we find that there is a strong need for research on the implications of such legislation from an operations perspective. In particular, as a discipline at the interface of systems design and economic modeling, operations focused research can be extremely useful in identifying appropriate e-waste take-back implementations for different business environments and how producers should react to them.

The Influence of Service Orientation on B2B e-Service Capabilities: An Empirical Investigation	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						service operations strategy; B2B electronic-services; B2B capabilities; service orientation; e-service delivery	RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; E-BUSINESS; E-COMMERCE; PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS; OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; TECHNOLOGY READINESS; ELECTRONIC COMMERCE	E-Services, or the company's portfolio of service offerings available to its customers through the Internet, are an emerging area of interest to operations management. Yet little is known about the operations and capabilities needed for provision of business-to-business (B2B) e-services. This paper aims to make a contribution toward closing this gap. First, we develop a new construct of B2B e-service capability, a term that captures a generic set of five interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) e-service recovery, (2) e-customization, (3) ease of navigation, (4) service portfolio comprehensiveness, and (5) information richness. These combined operational abilities are associated with B2B service delivery, including its portal design, technology architecture, and mix of product and service offerings. They are posited to be necessary for delivering effective B2B e-services. We also argue that, both service orientation (SO) and customer receptivity to technology, influence B2B e-service capability. We empirically test a path model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 181 businesses that have deployed B2B e-services. We find that the influence of SO on performance is not direct but rather mediated by the e-service capability, a finding that holds for both goods producers and service providers. We suggest that a firm's SO may mitigate industrial customers' resistance toward conducting business online.

Trust and Information Sharing in Supply Chains	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; trust; information sharing; salesperson; social characteristics	INTERPERSONAL-TRUST; ORGANIZATIONS; COORDINATION; EXCHANGE; NEGOTIATION; COOPERATION; RECIPROCITY; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; FAIRNESS	Drawing on behavioral research, we construct a multi-period model with which to examine the role of trust and other social characteristics in a supply chain. Specifically, we focus on trust building in the context of a salesperson who acts as a representative of a manufacturer and shares demand forecast information with a retailer. The actions of the salesperson affect both her immediate economic gain and her future credibility as determined by retailer's trust. Our analysis reveals that, in such environments, although salespersons of widely varying types (e.g., honest, self-serving, benevolent, loyal) lie some extent about their forecast information, they tend to be trusted in long relationships, provided their forecasting accuracy is higher than that of the retailer. Furthermore, while the presence of a salesperson can improve the profits of both the retailer and manufacturer, there are cost structures under which the manufacturer is better off without a salesperson. Finally, we make the general observation that the appropriate salesperson compensation scheme depends on her social characteristics, and the specific observation that when the salesperson cares for the retailer, the linear compensation scheme commonly suggested in the literature as the optimal compensation scheme for the salesperson is no longer optimal.

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Editorial Material						supply chain management; transaction-cost economics	TRANSACTION-COST ECONOMICS; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; OPERATIONS; FUTURE	A recent article by Oliver Williamson essentially comprises a critique of supply chain management (SCM) from the perspective of his own field, transaction-cost economics. Here is one reader's response. SCM can indeed be faulted for inflated rhetoric, among other sins. I believe, however, that the two fields have much to learn from each other.

J	Cavusoglu, H; Cavusoglu, H; Raghunathan, S				Cavusoglu, Hasan; Cavusoglu, Huseyin; Raghunathan, Srinivasan			Value of and Interaction between Production Postponement and Information Sharing Strategies for Supply Chain Firms	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information sharing; production postponement; supply chain management; demand uncertainty; pricing	COMPETITION; DEMAND; DIFFERENTIATION; MANAGEMENT; DISTORTION; INVENTORY; CAPACITY	We analyze the value of and interaction between production postponement and information sharing, which are two distinct strategies to reduce manufacturers uncertainty about demand. In both single-level and two-level supply chains, from the manufacturer's perspective, while information sharing is always valuable, production postponement can sometimes be detrimental. Furthermore, the value of production postponement is not merely driven by savings in inventory holding cost as postponement enables the manufacturer to avoid both excess and shortfall in production. We find that production postponement and information sharing strategies may substitute, complement, or conflict with each other, depending on the extent of the increase in the unit production cost when production is postponed. In a two-level supply chain, from the retailer's perspective, information sharing and production postponement can be beneficial or detrimental. When information sharing is beneficial to the retailer, the retailer always shares her demand information with the manufacturer voluntarily. In addition, this voluntary information sharing is truthful because inflated or deflated demand information hurts the retailer through a higher wholesale price or a stock-out. However, the retailer never shares her demand information voluntarily if the manufacturer has already adopted production postponement because production postponement and information sharing strategies always conflict with each other. Even when the retailer does not benefit from information sharing, we show that the manufacturer can always design an incentive mechanism to induce the retailer to share the demand information, irrespective of whether the manufacturer has already implemented production postponement or not. The above findings underscore the need for a careful assessment of demand uncertainty-reduction strategies before the supply chain players embark upon them.

J	Hsiao, L; Chen, YJ				Hsiao, Lu; Chen, Ying-Ju			Returns Policy and Quality Risk in E-Business	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						consumer returns; quality risk; restocking fees; satisfaction guaranteed	INTENSIFY RETAIL COMPETITION; MONEY-BACK GUARANTEES; PRODUCT QUALITY; PRICE; SALES; WARRANTIES; PROMOTIONS; MONOPOLY	In this article, we investigate the interplay between returns policy, pricing strategy, and quality risk. We define quality risk as the possibility of product misfit, defect, or unconformity with the consumers perception. These notions of quality risks differ in return policy restriction, residual values, and whether it is possible to unambiguously reduce the probability of mismatch. Using a stylized two-segment market setting, we demonstrate that consumer returns are offered only when the high-segment consumers incur a higher hassle cost, and both the quality risk and the valuation of the low segment are moderate. Moreover, it is possible to wisely design the returns policy that eliminates all inappropriate returns. Furthermore, the seller with a high-quality risk may offer a refund that exceeds the selling price, which provides a theoretical ground and specific operating regime for the satisfaction guaranteed policy used in some e-tailers. In contrast, when the quality risk is relatively low, further improvement on mitigating the quality risk may not necessarily benefit the seller. Finally, we observe that the restocking fee may be non-monotonic in product quality; thus, a more generous returns policy does not necessarily indicate a lower quality risk.

J	Li, YZ; Cheang, B; Lim, A				Li, Yanzhi; Cheang, Brenda; Lim, Andrew			Grocery Perishables Management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing and inventory control; perishable products; pricing; interface between operations and marketing	OPTIMAL ORDERING POLICIES; DETERIORATING INVENTORY; LOST SALES; MODELS; HEURISTICS; PRODUCT; SYSTEMS; DEMAND; CHAINS	In this article, we study the joint pricing and inventory control problem for perishables when a retailer does not sell new and old inventory at the same time. At the beginning of a period, the retailer makes replenishment and pricing decisions, and at the end of a period, the retailer decides whether to dispose of ending inventory or carry it forward to the next period. The objective of the retailer is to maximize the long-run average profit. Assuming zero lead time, we propose an efficient solution approach to the problem, which is also generalized to solve three extensions to the basic model. A feature of the present study is that we consider explicitly the influence of perishability on the demand. Among the insights gathered from the numerical analysis, we find that dynamic pricing aids extending shelf life and when disposal incurs a lower cost, or even a positive salvage value, the retailer is induced to dispose earlier since the benefit of selling new inventory offsets the loss due to disposal. We also observe that the faster the perceived rate of deterioration, the lower the threshold of the ending inventory for disposal. Perhaps a bit counter-intuitive, maximizing profits does not mean eliminating disposals or expirations.

J	Lin, YT; Parlakturk, A				Lin, Yen-Ting; Parlaktuerk, Ali			Quick Response under Competition	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						quick response; competition; pricing; supply chain	PURCHASE DISCOUNT CONTRACTS; SUPPLY CHAIN; INVENTORY COMPETITION; DYNAMIC PROCUREMENT; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; REACTIVE CAPACITY; FLEXIBILITY; ORDER; COST; DIFFERENTIATION	We consider a manufacturer serving two competing retailers that sell their products over a single selling season. The retailers place their regular orders before the season starts. In addition to this initial order, quick response (QR) provides a retailer with an additional replenishment opportunity after demand uncertainty is resolved. The manufacturer determines the unit price for QR replenishment. We characterize the retailers ordering, and the manufacturer's pricing decisions in equilibrium when none, only one, and both of the retailers have QR ability. We study how the profitability of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the channel depend on QR and competition. We find it may be optimal for the manufacturer to offer QR to only one of the ex ante identical retailers when demand variability is sufficiently, but not overly high. The manufacturer may also find it optimal to offer QR to both or none of the retailers, depending on demand variability. Finally, while QR ability is always attractive for a retailer when competition is ignored, we find QR may prove detrimental when its impact on competition is taken into account.

J	Arya, A; Pfeiffer, T				Arya, Anil; Pfeiffer, Thomas			Manufacturer-Retailer Negotiations in the Presence of an Oligopolistic Input Market	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cost-plus contracts; slotting allowances; supply chain negotiations	SLOTTING ALLOWANCES; SHARING CONTRACTS; SUPPLY CHAINS; COMPETITION; PROCUREMENT; PRODUCT; PRICE; COORDINATION; COSTS; FEES	When a manufacturer relies solely on its own inputs in making products, the focus of negotiations between the manufacturer and retailer is exclusively on profits in the output (retail) market. In such cases, absent retail competition concerns, standard two-part tariff negotiations set the per-unit wholesale price equal to marginal cost, and require fixed transfers from the retailer to the manufacturer. In this article, we recognize that manufacturers often rely on imperfectly competitive markets for at least some inputs. Incorporating this seemingly natural feature has profound implications for manufacturerretailer negotiations since it shifts their focus from being exclusively on output markets to one that balances strategic concerns in both input and output realms. The article's main result is that the added need to discipline input prices can lead the manufacturer and retailer to write contingent contracts that are cost-plus and prescribe lump-sum slotting allowances (i.e., fixed transfer from the manufacturer to the retailer).

J	Feng, Q; Shi, RX				Feng, Qi; Shi, Ruixia			Sourcing from Multiple Suppliers for Price-Dependent Demands	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						procurement policies; dynamic pricing; supplier diversification	COORDINATING INVENTORY CONTROL; FIXED ORDERING COST; YIELD RANDOMNESS; DIVERSIFICATION; REPLENISHMENT; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; POLICIES; DECISIONS; CAPACITY	We analyze a model that integrates demand shaping via dynamic pricing and risk mitigation via supply diversification. The firm under consideration replenishes a certain product from a set of capacitated suppliers for a price-dependent demand in each period. Under deterministic capacities, we derive a multilevel base stock list price policy and establish the optimality of cost-based supplier selection, that is, ordering from a cheaper source before more expensive ones. With general random capacities, however, neither result holds. While it is optimal to price low for a high inventory level, the optimal order quantities are not monotone with respect to the inventory level. In general, a near reorder-point policy should be followed. Specifically, there is a reorder point for each supplier such that no order is issued to him when the inventory level is above this point and a positive order is placed almost everywhere when the inventory level is below this point. Under this policy, it may be profitable to order exclusively from the most expensive source. We characterize conditions under which a strict reorder-point policy and a cost-based supplier-selection criterion become optimal. Moreover, we quantify the benefit from dynamic pricing, as opposed to static pricing, and the benefit from multiple sourcing, as opposed to single sourcing. We show that these two strategies exhibit a substitutable relationship. Dynamic pricing is less effective under multiple sourcing than under single sourcing, and supplier diversification is less valuable with price adjustments than without. Under limited supply, dynamic pricing yields a robust, long-term profit improvement. The value of supply diversification, in contrast, mainly comes from added capacities and is most significant in the short run.

We show that the problem can be reduced to an equivalent single-sourcing problem. However, the corresponding ordering cost is neither concave nor convex. Using the notion of quasi-convexity, we partially characterize the structure of the optimal policy and show that it can be specified by multiple thresholds which determine when to order from each supplier and how much. In contrast to previous research, which does not consider order size constraints, we show that it is optimal to simultaneously source from both suppliers when the beginning inventory level is sufficiently low. We also show that the decision to source from the low-cost supplier is not monotonic in the inventory level. Our results require that the variable costs satisfy a certain condition which guarantees quasi-convexity. However, extensive numerical results suggest that our policy is almost always optimal when the condition is not satisfied. We also show how the results can be extended to systems with multiple capacitated suppliers.

The demand for the product depends not only on the selling price but also on the quoted lead-time. To set the quoted lead-time, the firm has to carefully balance the benefit of increasing demand as the quoted lead-time is reduced against the cost of increased tardiness. Our model enables the firm to determine the optimal selling price, quoted lead-time, and order quantity simultaneously, and provides a new set of insights to managers.

J	Anderson, CK; Xie, XQ				Anderson, Chris K.; Xie, Xiaoqing			A Choice-Based Dynamic Programming Approach for Setting Opaque Prices	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; dynamic programming; marketing; pricing; buyer behavior	NETWORK REVENUE MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMER-CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; CHANNEL; MODEL	Opaque pricing is a form of pricing where certain characteristics of the product or service are hidden from the consumer until after purchase. In essence, opaque selling transforms a differentiated good into a commodity. Opaque pricing has become popular in service pricing as it allows firms to sell their differentiated product at higher prices to regular brand loyal customers while simultaneously selling to non-brand loyal customers at discounted prices. We use a nested logit model in combination with logistic regression and dynamic programming to illustrate how a service firm can optimally set prices on an opaque sales channel. The choice model allows the characterization of consumer trade-offs when purchasing opaque products while the dynamic programming approach allows the characterization of the optimal pricing policy as a function of inventory and time remaining. We compare optimal prices and expected revenues when dynamic pricing is restricted to daily price changes. We provide an illustrative example using data from an opaque selling mechanism () and a Washington DC-based hotel.

J	Ardalan, A; Diaz, R				Ardalan, Ali; Diaz, Rafael			NERJIT: Using Net Requirement Data in Kanban-Controlled Jumbled-Flow Shops	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						priority rules; JIT; simulation; jumbled-flow shops; sequencing	JUST-IN-TIME; JOB-SHOP; SEQUENCING RULES; JIT PHILOSOPHY; SUPPLY CHAIN; PULL SYSTEM; TO-ORDER; SIMULATION; ENVIRONMENT; PERFORMANCE	The bold lines that have separated the application of specific production planning and control techniques to specific production systems are being blurred by continuous advances in production technologies and innovative operational procedures. Oral communication among dispatchers and production units has given way to electronic communication between production planners and these units by continuous progress in information technologies. Current production literature alludes to the idea that, collectively, these advances have paved the way for application of Just-In-Time (JIT) production concepts, which were originally developed for mass production systems, in intermittent production systems. But this literature does not actually consider the possibility. This article presents a modification to JIT procedures to make them more suitable for jumbled-flow shops. This article suggests providing real-time information about net-requirements for each product to each work center operator for setting production priorities at each work center. Simulation experiments conducted for this study show that using Net-Requirements in JIT (NERJIT) reduces customer wait time by 4560% while reducing inventory slightly. The analysis of work centers input and output stock-point inventories shows that using the information about net-requirements results in production of items that are in current demand. NERJIT results in smaller input stock-point inventory and availability of products with higher priority in the output stock-points of work centers.

Unpacking Team Familiarity: The Effects of Geographic Location and Hierarchical Role	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						distributed teams; knowledge work; software; team familiarity; team productivity	TRANSACTIVE MEMORY-SYSTEMS; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; DISTRIBUTED TEAMS; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT; PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY; MEMBER FAMILIARITY; KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER; GROUP-PERFORMANCE	Examination of team productivity finds that team familiarity, i.e., individuals' prior shared work experience, can positively impact the efficiency and quality of team output. Despite the attention given to team familiarity and its contingencies, prior work has focused on whether team members have worked together, not on which team members have worked together, and under what conditions. In this paper, I parse overall team familiarity to consider effects of geographic location and the hierarchical roles of team members. Using data on all software-development projects completed over 3 years at a large Indian firm in the global outsourced software services industry, I find that team familiarity gained when team members work together in the same location has a significantly more positive effect on team performance compared with team familiarity gained while members were collaborating in different locations. Additionally, I find that hierarchical team familiarity (a manager's experience with front-line team members) and horizontal team familiarity (front-line team members' experience gained with one another) have differential effects on project team performance. These findings provide insight into the relationship between team experience and team performance.

An Application of Master Schedule Smoothing and Planned Lead Time Control	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						make-to-order; production smoothing; master production schedule; planned lead times; oil-rig building		Make-to-order (MTO) manufacturers must ensure concurrent availability of all parts required for production, as any unavailability may cause a delay in completion time. A major challenge for MTO manufacturers operating under high demand variability is to produce customized parts in time to meet internal production schedules. We present a case study of a producer of MTO offshore oil rigs that highlights the key aspects of the problem. The producer was faced with an increase in both demand and demand variability. Consequently, it had to rely heavily on subcontracting to handle production requirements that were in excess of its capacity. We focused on the manufacture of customized steel panels, which represent the main sub-assemblies for building an oil rig. We considered two key tactical parameters: the planning window of the master production schedule and the planned lead time of each workstation. Under the constraint of a fixed internal delivery lead time, we determined the optimal planning parameters. This improvement effort reduced the subcontracting cost by implementing several actions: the creation of a master schedule for each sub-assembly family of the steel panels, the smoothing of the master schedule over its planning window, and the controlling of production at each workstation by its planned lead time. We report our experience in applying the analytical model, the managerial insights gained, and how the application benefits the oil-rig producer.

The model is motivated by applications from various industries, in particular, the automobile industry, where a part supplier receives orders from both an original equipment manufacturer and the aftermarket. The product for the original equipment manufacturer is produced to stock, it has higher priority, and its demands are fully accepted. The aftermarket product is produced to order, and its demands can be either accepted or rejected. We characterize the optimal production and admission policies with a partial-linear structure, and using computational analysis, we provide insights into the benefits of the new policies. We also investigate the impact of production capacity, cost structure, and demand structure on system performance.	[Iravani, Seyed M.

Lifecycle Pricing for Installed Base Management with Constrained Capacity and Remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						installed base management; operational leasing; remanufacturing; lifecycle pricing; product; service bundle	PRODUCT DIFFUSION; DEMAND; EXTERNALITIES; COMPATIBILITY; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; OPERATIONS; WARRANTY; DYNAMICS; MODELS	Installed base management is the policy in which the manufacturer leases the product to consumers, and bundles repair and maintenance services along with the product. In this article, we investigate for the optimal leasing price and leasing duration decisions by a monopolist when the production and servicing capacity are constrained. The effect of diffusion of consumers in the installed base is considered, with the ownership of the product resting with the monopolist during the product lifecycle. The monopolist operating the installed base jointly optimizes the profits from leasing the product/service bundle along with maintenance revenues and remanufacturing savings. We formulate the manufacturer's problem as an optimal control problem and show that the optimal pricing strategy of the firm should be a skimming strategy. We also find that the effect of remanufacturing savings on the pricing decision and the length of the leasing duration changes significantly depending on the duration of the product's lifecycle. If the product lifecycle is long and remanufacturing savings are low, the firm should offer a shorter leasing duration, whereas if the remanufacturing savings are high, the firm should optimally offer a higher leasing duration. In contrast, if the time duration of the product lifecycle is low and remanufacturing savings are low, the firm prefers to offer a shorter leasing duration, whereas if the remanufacturing savings are high, the firm should optimally have a longer leasing duration. The article also shows that if the production capacity is small, the manufacturer increases the leasing duration. If the production capacity is very small, the manufacturer sets the leasing duration to be equal to the product lifecycle and does not use remanufacturing.

The retailer has to pay a fixed cost for each product included in the assortment and a variable cost per product sold. Quality levels, fixed, and variable costs are exogenously determined. Customers differ in their valuation of quality and choose the product (if any) that maximizes their utility. First, we consider a setting in which the selling prices are also fixed. We find that the optimal set of products to offer depends on the distribution of customer valuations and might include dominated products, that is, products which are less attractive than at least one other product, on every possible dimension. We develop an efficient algorithm to identify an optimal assortment. Second, we consider a setting in which the retailer also determines the selling prices. We show that in this case the optimal assortment does not include any dominated product and does not vary with the distribution of customer valuations when there is no fixed cost. We develop several efficient algorithms to identify an optimal assortment and optimally price the products. We also test the applicability of our methods with realistic data for two product categories.

The method is simple and has been shown to provide superior performance in many applications. In this article, we analyze how the location in which products are stored in the rack affects throughput. We identify conditions where storage decisions have a large impact on throughput (e.g., a 20% increase in productivity) and conditions where the impact is minimal. Conditions associated with high impact are high variation in worker skill, high variation in SKU volume, and a moderate level of walking-to-picking work content per pick list.

We first consider the approach of operational statistics and review related results which enable us to maximize a priori expected profit uniformly over all parameter values, when the demand distribution is known up to the location and scale parameters. For the case of the unknown shape parameter, we first suggest a heuristic approach based on operational statistics to obtain improved ordering policies and illustrate the same for the case of a Pareto demand distribution. In more general cases where the heuristic is not applicable, we suggest linear correction and support vector regression approaches to better estimate ordering policies, and illustrate these using a Gamma demand distribution. In certain cases, our proposed approaches are found to yield significant improvements.

On Optimal Expediting Policy for Supply Systems with Uncertain Lead-Times	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply uncertainty; random lead-time; lead-time information; expediting; safety lead-time	STOCHASTIC INVENTORY MODEL; MANAGEMENT; CHAIN	We examine the role of expediting in dealing with lead-time uncertainties associated with global supply chains of functional products (high volume, low demand uncertainty goods). In our developed stylized model, a retailer sources from a supplier with uncertain lead-time to meet his stable and known demand, and the supply lead-time is composed of two random duration stages. At the completion time of the first stage, the retailer has the option to expedite a portion of the replenishment order via an alternative faster supply mode. We characterize the optimal expediting policy in terms of if and how much of the order to expedite and explore comparative statics on the optimal policy to better understand the effects of changes in the cost parameters and lead-time properties. We also study how the expediting option affects the retailer's decisions on the replenishment order (time and size of order placement). We observe that with the expediting option the retailer places larger orders closer to the start of the selling season, thus having this option serve as a substitute for the safety lead-time and allowing him to take increased advantages of economies of scale. Finally we extend the basic model by looking at correlated lead-time stages and more than two random lead-time stages.

Price and Service Competition in an Outsourced Supply Chain	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						single-sourcing; multisourcing; competition; pricing; coordination	QUALITY COMPETITION; INVENTORY MODELS; QUEUING SYSTEM; DIVERSIFICATION; COORDINATION; UNCERTAINTY; INDUSTRIES; ALLOCATION; SERVERS; DEMAND	We consider a buyer who outsources the manufacturing of a product to multiple symmetric make-to-stock suppliers who compete on price and service (fill rate). The buyer allocates demand to the suppliers using a score function with an exponential form, which specifies the relative importance of price vs. service, in order to minimize his costs, while the suppliers choose their prices and fill rates to maximize their profits. For the case of dual-sourcing, we characterize the optimal parameter of the exponential score function, considering the impact of the buyer's decisions on the suppliers, and considering how the suppliers compete against each other to earn a portion of the buyer's demand. We prove the existence of a unique equilibrium and characterize the equilibrium behavior of the system. We then consider a general number of suppliers and show that the equilibrium prices and fill rates, and the buyer's cost, are increasing in the number of suppliers. We compare these results to a model of single-sourcing, in which the buyer is the Stackelberg leader and extracts all profits from the supplier. We find that the buyer always prefers single-sourcing to multisourcing. Finally, we study a centralized system and use the results to develop a coordinating contract for the decentralized system.

Contracting and Coordination under Asymmetric Production Cost Information	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						adverse selection; type-dependent reservation profit; contracting; supply chain efficiency; demand uncertainty	CAPACITATED SUPPLY CHAINS; PARTICIPATION; INCENTIVES; RETAILER; POLICY	We analyze a supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer. The supplier's unit production cost, which characterizes his type, is only privately known to him. When trading with the retailer, the supplier demands a reservation profit that depends on his unit production cost. We model this problem as a game of adverse selection. In this model, the retailer offers a menu of contracts, each of which consists of two parameters: the ordering quantity and the supplier's share of the channel profit. We show that the optimal contract depends critically on a surrogate measurethe ratio of the types reservation profit differential to their production cost differential. An important implication from our analysis is that information asymmetry alone does not necessarily induce loss in channel efficiency. The optimal contract can coordinate the supply chain as long as the low-cost supplier's cost efficiency is neither much overvalued nor much undervalued in the outside market. We further discuss the retailer's preference of the supplier's type under different market conditions, as well as evaluate the effects of the supplier's reservation profit, the retail price, and the demand uncertainty on the optimal contract.

The firm can purchase the product either from option contracts or from the spot market. Different option contracts are offered by a set of suppliers with a two-part fee structure: a unit reservation cost and a unit exercising cost. The spot market price is random and its realization may affect the subsequent option contract prices. The firm decides the reservation quantity from each supplier and the product selling price at the beginning of each period and the number of options to exercise (inventory replenishment) at the end of the period to maximize the total expected profit over its planning horizon. We show that the optimal inventory replenishment policy is order-up-to type with a sequence of decreasing thresholds. We also investigate the optimal option-reservation policy and the optimal pricing strategy. The optimal reservation quantities and selling price are shown to be both decreasing in the starting inventory level when demand function is additive. Building upon the analytical results, we conduct a numerical study to unveil additional managerial insights. Among other things, we quantify the values of the option contracts and dynamic pricing to the firm and show that they are more significant when the market demand becomes more volatile.

Between two replenishments, a unit can be transshipped to a stocked-out retailer from the other. It arrives a transshipment time later, during which the stocked-out retailer incurs backorder cost. Without transshipment, backorder cost is incurred until the next replenishment. Since the transshipment time is shorter than the time between two replenishments, transshipments can reduce the backorder cost at the stocked-out retailer and the holding costs at the other retailer. The system is directed by a centralized inventory manager, who minimizes the long-run average cost consisting of replenishment, holding, backorder, and transshipment costs. The transshipment policy is characterized by hold-back inventory levels, which are nonincreasing in the remaining time until the next replenishment. The transshipment policy differs from those in the literature because we allow for multiple transshipments between replenishments, positive transshipment times, and backorder costs. We also discuss the challenges associated with positive replenishment time and develop upper and lower bounds of average cost in this case. Bounds are numerically shown to have an average gap of 1.1%. A heuristic solution is based on the upper bound and differs from the optimal cost by at most this gap.

Reassessing Tradeoffs Inherent to Simultaneous Maintenance and Production Planning	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						production scheduling; equipment maintenance; Markov decision processes; first-come-first-serve	LINE EQUIPMENT CONDITION; PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE; PRODUCTION POLICIES; YIELD INFORMATION	Previous work has considered the simultaneous (as opposed to sequential) optimization of a maintenance policy and a production policy in a multi-product setting with random yield and product mix constraints. One of the sequential approaches to which the simultaneous approach is compared is a so-called first-come-first-served (FCFS) approach, i.e., an approach that generates randomized production policies that do not depend on the deterioration state of the machine. However, the model formulation for this approach does not generate policies consistent with this FCFS notion. Therefore, we present a revised FCFS model and analyze its performance using an existing experimental design. The results suggest that previous work overestimates the degree to which a FCFS approach is suboptimal, and underestimates the value of simultaneously optimizing the maintenance and production decisions. Lastly, we conduct additional experiments which suggest that the joint impact of using both simultaneous optimization and a deterioration dependent production policy is quite significant.

Researchers' Perspectives on Supply Chain Risk Management	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain risk management; researcher survey; literature review; research agenda	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; PERFORMANCE; DISRUPTIONS; FIELD; GLITCHES; INDUSTRY; COMPANY; DEMAND	Supply chain risk management (SCRM) is a nascent area emerging from a growing appreciation for supply chain risk by practitioners and by researchers. However, there is diverse perception of research in supply chain risk because these researchers have approached this area from different domains. This paper presents our study of this diversity from the perspectives of operations and supply chain management scholars: First, we reviewed the researchers' output, i.e., the recent research literature. Next, we surveyed two focus groups (members of Supply Chain Thought Leaders and International SCRM groups) with open-ended questions. Finally, we surveyed operations and supply chain management researchers during the 2009 INFORMS meeting in San Diego. Our findings characterize the diversity in terms of three gaps: a definition gap in how researchers define SCRM, a process gap in terms of inadequate coverage of response to risk incidents, and a methodology gap in terms of inadequate use of empirical methods. We also list ways to close these gaps as suggested by the researchers.

Pricing Decisions During Inter-Generational Product Transition	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						dynamic pricing; product transition; new product introduction; multinomial logit model	REVENUE MANAGEMENT; SEASONAL PRODUCTS; INVENTORY; MODEL; SUBSTITUTION	How should companies price products during an inter-generational transition? High uncertainty in a new product introduction often leads to extreme cases of demand and supply mismatches. Pricing is an effective tool to either prevent or alleviate these problems. We study the optimal pricing decisions in the context of a product transition in which a new-generation product replaces an old one. We formulate the dynamic pricing problem and derive the optimal prices for both the old and new products. Our analysis sheds light on the pattern of the optimal prices for the two products during the transition and on how product replacement, along with several other dynamics including substitution, external competition, scarcity, and inventory, affect the optimal prices. We also determine the optimal initial inventory for each product and discuss a heuristic method.

Two important phases involved in working with technology vendors are vendor selection and vendor management. Because for both steps theory development of key decision guidelines is still immature, we use detailed case studies of 31 innovation outsourcing projects at Siemens to develop grounded theory on provider selection criteria and on project management success drivers. A selection criterion often associated with successful outsourcing is the provider's track record or previous experience. Our cases suggest that there is no standard track record for success but that a match between the client firm's outsourcing motivation and the provider's strengths appears to be a necessary condition for a successful outsourcing collaboration. As to the second phasemanaging the vendorwe identify a number of operational project success drivers. There seems to be no universal checklist, but the most important drivers seem to be contingent on the type of vendor chosen and on the maturity of the technology. We compare five provider typesuniversities, competitors, customers, start-up companies, and component suppliersand find that some success drivers are common to all providers, while others are relevant only for certain types of provider. Moreover, drivers in the case of a mature technology are more focused on successful transfer to manufacturing than on development itself. Our findings offer guidelines for innovation managers on how to select innovation providers and how to manage them during the project.

We develop a measure of seat value, called the Seat Value Index, and relate it to seat location and consumer characteristics. We implement our analysis on a proprietary data set that a professional baseball franchise in Japan collected from its customers, and provide recommendations. For instance, we find that customers seated in symmetric seats on left and right fields might derive very different valuations from the seats. We also find that the more frequent visitors to the stadium report extreme seat value less often when compared with first-time visitors. Our findings and insights remain robust to the effects of price and game-related factors. Thus, our research quantifies the significant influence of seat location on the ex-post seat value perceived by customers. Utilizing the heterogeneity in seat values at different seat locations, we provide segment-specific pricing recommendations based on a service-level objective that would limit the fraction of customers experiencing low seat value to a desired threshold.

Revenue Management with End-of-Period Discounts in the Presence of Customer Learning	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						revenue management; customer learning; smoothing; self-regulating; wait-or-buy; strategic consumers	STRATEGIC CONSUMERS; CLEARANCE SALES; MONOPOLIST; CAPACITY; DEMAND; ALLOCATION	Consider a firm that sells identical products over a series of selling periods (e.g., weekly all-inclusive vacations at the same resort). To stimulate demand and enhance revenue, in some periods, the firm may choose to offer a part of its available inventory at a discount. As customers learn to expect such discounts, a fraction may wait rather than purchase at a regular price. A problem the firm faces is how to incorporate this waiting and learning into its revenue management decisions. To address this problem we summarize two types of learning behaviors and propose a general model that allows for both stochastic consumer demand and stochastic waiting. For the case with two customer classes, we develop a novel solution approach to the resulting dynamic program. We then examine two simplified models, where either the demand or the waiting behavior are deterministic, and present the solution in a closed form. We extend the model to incorporate three customer classes and discuss the effects of overselling the capacity and bumping customers. Through numerical simulations we study the value of offering end-of-period deals optimally and analyze how this value changes under different consumer behavior and demand scenarios.

J	Jacobs, BW; Subramanian, R				Jacobs, Brian W.; Subramanian, Ravi			Sharing Responsibility for Product Recovery Across the Supply Chain	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						extended producer responsibility; collection; recycling; supply chain coordination; social welfare	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; TAKE-BACK; E-WASTE; PART 1; POLICIES; DESIGN; COORDINATION; ECONOMICS	Extended producer responsibility (EPR) programs typically hold the producera single actor defined by the regulatorresponsible for the environmental impacts of end-of-life products. This is despite emphasis on the need to involve all actors in the supply chain in order to best achieve the aims of EPR. In this paper, we examine the economic and environmental implications of product recovery mandates and shared responsibility within a supply chain. We use a two-echelon model consisting of a supplier and a manufacturer to determine the impacts of product collection and recycling mandates on the incentive to recycle and resulting profits in the integrated and decentralized supply chains. For the decentralized supply chain, we demonstrate how the sharing of responsibility for product recovery between the echelons can improve total supply chain profit and suggest a contract menu that can Pareto-improve profits. To examine both the economic and environmental performance associated with responsibility sharing, we propose a social welfare construct that includes supply chain profit, consumer surplus, and the externalities associated with virgin material extraction, product consumption, and disposal of nonrecycled products. Using a numerical example, we discuss how responsibility sharing may or may not improve social welfare.

J	Quariguasi-Frota-Neto, J; Bloemhof, J				Quariguasi-Frota-Neto, Joao; Bloemhof, Jacqueline			An Analysis of the Eco-Efficiency of Remanufactured Personal Computers and Mobile Phones	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sustainability; eco-efficiency; remanufacturing; closed-loop supply chains; sustainable development	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENERGY	Remanufacturing, long perceived as an environmentally friendly initiative, is supported by a number of governments. Yet, the assumption that remanufacturing is desirable to society has never been systematically investigated. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness and eco-efficiency of remanufacturing in the personal computer and mobile phone industries. We investigate whether remanufacturing substantially reduces the environmental impact, as measured by cumulative energy demand (CED), generated over the life cycles (LCs) of these products, and the size of any reduction. We also examine the relative eco-efficiency of remanufacturing compared with virgin manufacturing for these two products, where eco-efficiency includes both willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the products as well as the energy consumed in producing the products. Our main findings are the following. One, remanufacturing is an effective way to reduce the total energy consumed during the LCs of personal computers and mobile phones, with one notable exception, when the life spans of remanufactured products are substantially shorter than the life spans of their new counterparts. Two, a remanufactured personal computer or mobile phone is not always more eco-efficient than a corresponding new product. Three, the WTP for remanufactured personal computers and mobile phones, and consequently, their eco-efficiencies, are a function of the prices of the correspondent new products at launch and years elapsed between launch and remanufacturing. Four, remanufactured units are sold at a discount relative to the price of new personal computers and mobile phones. Five, on the whole, the market for remanufactured mobile phones is more eco-efficient than the market for new mobile phones. Six, the market for remanufactured computers is more eco-efficient than the market for new computers. Lastly, because the group of remanufactured products is heterogeneous, not all remanufactured units are more eco-efficient than the average new computer and mobile phone. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of our findings on European WEEE and WEEE-like legislation.

Each ship has a capacity constraint limiting the total number of containers it can carry and each ship visits a given set of ports following a predetermined route. Each container has a release date at its origination port, and a due date at its destination port. A container has a size 1 or size 2; size 1 represents a 1 TEU (20-foot equivalent unit) and size 2 represents 2 TEUs. The delivery time of a container is defined as the time when the ship that carries the container arrives at its destination port. We consider the problem of minimizing the maximum tardiness over all containers. We consider three scenarios with regard to the routes of the ships, namely, the ships having (i) identical, (ii) nested, and (iii) arbitrary routes. For each scenario, we consider different settings for origination ports, release dates, sizes of containers, and number of ports; we determine the computational complexity of various cases. We also provide a simple heuristic for some cases, with its worst case analysis. Finally, we discuss the relationship of our problems with other scheduling problems that are known to be open.

J	Dai, Y; Zhou, SX; Xu, YF				Dai, Yue; Zhou, Sean X.; Xu, Yifan			Competitive and Collaborative Quality and Warranty Management in Supply Chains	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product quality; warranty period; warranty-dependent demand; Nash equilibrium; supply chain coordination	PRODUCT WARRANTY; IMPERFECT PRODUCTION; CONTRACTS; IMPROVEMENT; MODELS; PRICE	Product quality and product warranty coverage are two important and closely related operational decisions. A longer warranty protection period can boost sales, but it may also result in dramatically increased warranty cost, if product quality is poor. To investigate how these two decisions interact with each other and influence supply chain performance, we develop a single-period model with a supplier that provides a product to an original equipment manufacturer, which in turn sells it to customers. Customer demand is random and affected by the length of the product warranty period. Warranty costs are incurred by both the supplier and the manufacturer. We analyze two different scenarios based on which party sets the warranty period: manufacturer warranty and supplier warranty. Product quality is controlled by the supplier, and the manufacturer determines the ordering quantity. We analyze these decentralized systems and provide the structural properties of the equilibrium strategies. We also compare the results of centralized and decentralized systems and identify the conditions under which one system provides a longer warranty and better product quality than the other. Our numerical study further shows that, in decentralized settings, when the warranty period is determined by the firm sharing the larger proportion of total warranty costs, the supply chain can achieve greater system-wide profit. Both parties can therefore benefit from properly delegating the warranty decision and sharing the resulting additional profit. We further design a supplier-development and buy-back contract for coordinating decentralized supply chains. Several extensions are also discussed.

Controlling Power Retailer's Gray Activities Through Contract Design	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; contract design; retailing; diversion; gray market	PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; CHANNEL COORDINATION; DOMINANT RETAILER; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; MARKETS; DISCOUNTS	We develop a model that captures dynamic relationships of a supply chain populated by a dominant retailer and a number of fringe retailers. The two types of retailers are asymmetric in buying power, retailing cost, and the ability to service the manufacturer's product. The wholesale prices offered through a quantity discount (QD) schedule can coordinate such a supply chain, but invite channel flow diversion type of gray trading between the dominant retailer and the fringe retailers. Our analysis is focused on how such a channel can be coordinated and the gray market activities be prevented. We propose a dynamic QD contract or a revenue-sharing contract that the manufacturer can use to fight the gray market activity. The performance of the supply chain and the manufacturer's profit under each of the two contract forms are compared and managerial guidelines are provided to help the manufacturer make a judicious choice.

J	Kouvelis, P; Li, J				Kouvelis, Panos; Li, Jian			Contingency Strategies in Managing Supply Systems with Uncertain Lead-Times	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						uncertain supply; random lead-time; safety lead-time; disruption safety stock; dynamic emergency response	DISRUPTION RISKS; INVENTORY SYSTEM; MODEL; INFORMATION; POLICIES; CHAIN; FLEXIBILITY; MITIGATION; MANAGEMENT; OPTION	The globalization of markets and geographic dispersion of production facilities, combined with a heavy outsourcing of supply chain processes, have substantially increased the exposure of supply chains to supply lead-times of long and uncertain nature. In this paper, we study the potential use of two contingency strategies on top of the conventionally used time bufferstatically planned safety lead-time (SL)approach to deal with the lead-time uncertainty. These are (1) the ex-ante planning for disruption safety stock (DSS) to be released when a disruption (in this case, late delivery of the order) occurs; and (2) the ex-post dynamic emergency response (DER), which dynamically decides on the timing and size of an emergency order to be placed. Our work elaborates on the optimal parameter setting for these strategies, compares their added values when used to complement the traditional SL approach, and examines how the use of the contingency strategies affects the SL and corresponding cycle length of a periodic review system. Our research finds that: (1) the above contingency strategies reduce the reliance on the SL and are cost effective when the coefficient of variation (CV) of the uncertain lead-time is high; (2) it is important to re-optimize the SL to account for the contingency plans; and (3) re-optimization of the cycle length to account for the presence of the contingency responses, as opposed to using an EOQ-determined cycle length, does not significantly improve the cost performance. However, such re-optimization does well in the SL approach when the CV of the uncertain lead-time is high.

PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						price quotation; lead time; uniform quotation mode; differentiated quotation mode	QUEUING-SYSTEMS; DELAY COSTS; DECISIONS; DEMAND; APPROXIMATIONS; MANAGEMENT; DELIVERY; MONOPOLY; QUALITY; DESIGN	Firms in service and make-to-order manufacturing industries often quote lead times and prices to customers. We define uniform quotation mode (UQM) as the strategy where a firm offers a single lead time and price quotation, and differentiated quotation mode (DQM) is where a firm offers a menu of lead times and prices for customers to choose from. Both modes are followed in practice. Firms should determine which is more profitable. We classify customers into two groups: lead time sensitive (LS) and price sensitive (PS). LS customers value lead time reduction more than PS customers. We develop mathematical models of both quotation modes and analyze them to determine the most profitable mode under specified situations as well as the best lead time and price quotations within each mode. We find that DQM is dominated by UQM whenever PS customers have positive utilities from UQM or LS customers have positive utilities from DQM. Otherwise, which quotation mode is better depends on multiple factors, such as customer characteristics (including lead time reduction valuation and product valuation of a customer, and the proportion of LS customers) and production characteristics (including the desired service level and service or production cost).

J	Eynan, A; Dong, LX				Eynan, Amit; Dong, Lingxiu			Design of Flexible Multi-Stage Processes	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						flexible resource; flexible capacity; multi-stage process; process flexibility; process design	MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; INVESTMENT; STRATEGIES; CAPACITY	Faced with demand uncertainty across multiple product lines, many companies have recourse to flexible capacities which can process different products in order to better balance the trade-off between capacity utilization and cost efficiency. Many studies demonstrated the potential benefit of using flexible capacity at the aggregate level by treating a whole plant or a whole process as a single stage. This paper extends these analyses by studying the benefits of flexible capacity while considering the multi-stage structure of processes and consequently determining which stages should be flexible, which should be dedicated, and how much capacity to assign to each stage. We consider a two-product firm which operates in a process-to-order environment and faces uncertain demand. Each stage of the process can be designed as dedicated or flexible. Dedicated resources are highly cost efficient but limited to the single product they are exclusively designed for, whereas flexible resources are versatile to handle several products but are more expensive. Using a general mathematical formulation our analysis shows that the optimal design may have some dedicated and some flexible stages along the process. Interestingly, this decision should be decoupled from the chronological order of the stages along the process.
