When the projects' delay costs differ, the problem (a "restless bandit") has not been solved in general. We consider the policy of working on the project with the highest expected delay loss as if the other project was completely finished first (although recourse is allowed). This policy is optimal if: (1) the delay cost increases with the delay regardless of the performance state, (2) costs are not discounted (or, discounting is dominated by delay costs), (3) projects are not abandoned based on their performance state during processing at the scarce resource, and (4) there are no stochastic delays. These assumptions are often fulfilled for processing at specialized resources, such as tests or one-off analyses.

Scientific literature on production control offers valuable knowledge, but the complexity of real-life processes makes it impossible to directly apply this knowledge in real-life. The presented tool identifies possible deficiencies in the current way of managing the business processes, by matching the scientific knowledge on order planning with data reflecting the real-life processes via logistic regression. A case study at a maintenance organization illustrates the diagnosis tool.

J	Bradley, JR; Conway, RW				Bradley, JR; Conway, RW			Managing cyclic inventories	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory; lot-sizing; scheduling; cyclic schedules; changeover	LOT SCHEDULING PROBLEM; DEMAND; SIZES; TIMES	Cyclic inventory is the buffer following a machine that cycles over a set of products, each of which is subsequently consumed in a continuous manner. Scheduling such a machine is interesting when the changeover times from one product to another are non-trivial-which is generally the case. This problem has a substantial literature, but the common practices of "lot-splitting" and "maximization of utilization" suggest that many practitioners still do not fully understand the principles of cyclic inventory. This paper is a tutorial that demonstrates those principles. We show that cyclic inventory is directly proportional to cycle length, which in turn is directly proportional to total changeover time, and inversely proportional to machine utilization. We demonstrate the virtue of "maximum changeover policies" in minimizing cyclic inventory-and the difficulty in making the transition to an increased level of demand. In so doing, we explicate the different roles of cyclic inventory, transitional inventory, and safety stock. We demonstrate the interdependence of the products in the cycle-the lot-size for one product cannot be set independently of the remaining products. We also give necessary conditions for consideration of improper schedules (i.e., where a product can appear more than once in the cycle), and demonstrate that both lot-splitting and maximization of utilization are devastatingly counter-productive when changeover time is non-trivial.

We develop four metrics using the principle that a volume flexible firm can handle similar levels of uncertainty (as measured by sales variability) with smaller fluctuations in inputs (as measured by variability in cost of goods sold and variability in inventory levels). Then, using 20 years of Compustat data on 550 firms in the capital goods industry, we find that on three of four process-based measures, small firms are more volume flexible. However, when we incorporate financial performance into our fourth metric, we find that large firms are more volume flexible. We conclude that, to be volume flexible is one thing, but to benefit from this flexibility, firms need to focus on the cost of being flexible.

Effective scheduling systems have the goal of matching demand with capacity so that resources are better utilized and patient waiting times are minimized. Our goal is to present general problem formulation and modeling considerations, and to provide taxonomy of methodologies used in previous literature. Current literature fails to develop generally applicable guidelines to design appointment systems, as most studies have suggested highly situation-specific solutions. We identify future research directions that provide opportunities to expand existing knowledge and close the gap between theory and practice.

Typical measures, already in place in more developed countries, include imposing riparian strips and protecting fragile soils from the use of heavy machinery. While environmental protection measures have been considered vital for decades, so far there has been almost no attempt to quantify both the benefits and costs of these measures. This paper attempts to measure the costs associated with the main measures which can help both the forestry firms and the government evaluate the cost impact of the new environmental protection regulations being studied. The analysis for different environmental scenarios is carried out by modifying a mixed integer LP, currently used for tactical planning by one forestry firm.

One productive use of hazardous wastes is to blend them into fuel, which mitigates damage to the environment by recycling waste into fuel and reducing fossil-fuel consumption. Operations personnel face a daunting task of efficiently blending hazardous waste into fuel, while simultaneously maintaining environmental regulatory requirements. This research develops a goal-programming approach to the waste-fuel-blending process that considers the diverse objectives of fuel managers. A real-world case study at a cement kiln illustrates the effectiveness of this approach, where the implementation followed principles of learn building and quality management.

J	Ketzenberg, ME; Souza, GC; Guide, VDR				Ketzenberg, ME; Souza, GC; Guide, VDR			Mixed assembly and disassembly operations for remanufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						remanufacturing; assembly lines; queuing; simulation	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	In this paper we consider the problem of designing a mixed assembly-disassembly line for remanufacturing. That is, parts from the disassembly and repair of used products can be used to build "new" products. This is a problem common to many OEM remanufacturers, such as Xerox or Kodak. We study two main configurations, under the assumption that the disassembly sequence is exactly the reverse of the assembly sequence. Under a parallel configuration, there exist two separate dedicated lines, one for assembly and one for disassembly, which are decoupled by buffers-from both disassembly operations, which have preference, as well as parts from an outside, perfectly reliable supplier. Under a mixed configuration, the same station is used for both disassembly and assembly of a specific part. The problem is studied using G1/G/c networks, as well as simulation. Due to a loss of pooling, we conclude that the parallel configuration outperforms the mixed line only when the variability of both arrivals and processing time are significantly higher for disassembly and remanufacturing than for assembly. Via a simulation, we explore the impact of having advanced yield information for the remanufacturing parts. We find that advanced yield information generally improves flow times; however, there are some instances where it lengthens flow times.

J	Klassen, RD; Vachon, S				Klassen, RD; Vachon, S			Collaboration and evaluation in the supply chain: The impact on plant-level environmental investment	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						environmental management; pollution prevention; pollution control; supply chain management; ISO 14001	TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; GREEN; FIRM	Manufacturing organizations can potentially improve environmental management both by increasing the level of investment in environmental technologies and by shifting that investment away from pollution control and toward pollution prevention. However, managers must not only consider their own manufacturing operations in isolation, but also those of others along the supply chain. This paper explores two dimensions of supply chain activities-collaboration and evaluation-that might be leveraged by plant managers to improve environmental management in their own plant. The linkages with suppliers and customers were assessed. Both customer- and plant-initiated collaboration were found to have a significant effect on the level and form of investment in environmental technologies for a sample of Canadian plants. Of greatest importance, as customer-initiated collaborative activities increased, plant-level investment in environmental management was increasingly allocated toward pollution prevention. In contrast, only very limited evidence was found that evaluative activities influenced environmental investment.

This new standard holds the promise of waste reduction and better process management, but the benefits and costs are very difficult to predict. This study attempts to identify and explain antecedents impacting the decision to pursue certification for some of the first plants certified in the United States. Using data from a large survey of U.S. managers and a Logit analysis, we find the factors influencing management decisions to actively pursue ISO 14001 certification to be distinctly different from those factors influencing management's decision not to pursue certification. For the latter, the decision is economically based; for the former, it is driven by other, more qualitative considerations.

Drawing on a unique data set comprised of detailed surveys of 42 automotive assembly plants, associated quality metrics, and in-depth qualitative data from 17 automotive assembly plants, we show that attaining superior environmental performance can be a significant driver of superior quality. We highlight the synergistic and reciprocal nature of environmental and broader manufacturing improvement efforts, and show that environmental improvement tools and know-how can be an important source of competitive advantage.

This study reports empirical insights to EMS practices based on the largest EMS survey of manufacturing firms in the United States. The objective of the study is to test for a relationship between environmental management systems and perceived operations performance while considering direct and indirect effects of various environmental practices. The results of this study are supported by several field studies and provide a new source of information regarding EMS theory development. The results also indicate a positive relationship between an EMS, the environmental practices a firm engages, and operations performance measures.

First, we motivate the need for an SOM research agenda. Second, we offer a research framework that paints a broad-based picture of key architectural elements in the SOM research landscape. The framework builds upon prior and emerging research for designing, delivering and evaluating services. Third, in order to stimulate future research in SOM, we use this framework to hone in on five understudied and emerging research themes that underpin our proposed SOM research agenda. .

J	Goodale, JC; Verma, R; Pullman, ME				Goodale, JC; Verma, R; Pullman, ME			A market utility-based model for capacity scheduling in mass services	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service design; service attributes; staff scheduling; service economics	CUSTOMER CONTACT; COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT; DESIGN; OPERATIONS; QUALITY; PRODUCTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; BUSINESSES; ALLOCATION; WORKFORCE	Only a small set of employee scheduling articles have considered an objective of profit or contribution maximization, as opposed to the traditional objective of cost (including opportunity costs) minimization. In this article, we present one such formulation that is a market utility-based model for planning and scheduling in mass services (MUMS). MUMS is a holistic approach to market-based service capacity scheduling. The MUMS framework provides the structure for modeling the consequences of aligning competitive priorities and service attributes with an element of the firm's service infrastructure. We developed a new linear programming formulation for the shift-scheduling problem that uses market share information generated by customer preferences for service attributes. The shift-scheduling formulation within the framework of MUMS provides a business-level model that predicts the economic impact of the employee schedule. We illustrated the shift-scheduling model with empirical data, and then compared its results with models using service standard and productivity standard approaches. The result of the empirical analysis provides further justification for the development of the market-based approach. Last, we discuss implications of this methodology for future research.

J	Goldstein, SM				Goldstein, SM			Employee development: An examination of service strategy in a high-contact service environment	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service strategy; employee development; customer satisfaction; empirical research; structural equation modeling	RESOURCE MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; CUSTOMER CONTACT; QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; SATISFACTION; IMPACT; PROFITABILITY; ORGANIZATION; DESIGN; MODELS	A critical component of service strategy in high-contact environments is service encounter management. Effective service encounters are a result of the quality of employee development, including systems for work and job design, training and development, and attention to employee well being. Results of empirical analysis indicate that service strategies reflecting the dimensions of employee development drive employee outcomes such as productivity and satisfaction. Employee outcomes are significantly associated with customer satisfaction, but only some linkages to financial performance are significant. This study illustrates the importance of employee development in service strategy design for managing service encounters in high contact service environments.

J	Akkermans, H; Vos, B				Akkermans, H; Vos, B			Amplification in service supply chains: An exploratory case study from the telecom industry	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; service operations; amplification; case study	OPERATIONS; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; IMPACT	Evidence on the impact of amplification effects on supply chain performance primarily has been derived from studies in manufacturing industries. In this article we reported on a case study from the telecommunication industry and aimed to analyze relevant root causes and associated countermeasures of the amplification phenomenon in service supply chains. Our case findings confirm the occurrence of upstream amplification of workload in the service supply chain, workload being a more appropriate measure for amplification effects in service supply chains than inventory levels. Not all of the root causes for amplification effects known from research in manufacturing environments were found to apply in this particular service context, especially those related to the use of inventory. In addition, our telecom case study highlighted a new root cause for amplification: interactions of high workloads and reduced process quality that start reinforcing each other once workloads pass a certain threshold. In this particular case, many of the known countermeasures to eliminate amplification did not apply, because of the specific characteristics of the service process, or yielded only limited results. A potentially very powerful countermeasure identified was to implement quality improvements throughout the service chain. This quality dimension links our research to the literature on service management in general, where service quality is on top of the research agenda.

J	Athanassopoulos, AD; Iliakopoulos, A				Athanassopoulos, AD; Iliakopoulos, A			Modeling customer satisfaction in telecommunications: Assessing the effects of multiple transaction points on the perceived overall performance of the provider	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						customer satisfaction; consumer behaviour; telecommunications; decision making	MEASURING SERVICE QUALITY; DYNAMIC PROCESS MODEL; CONSUMER SATISFACTION; SWITCHING BEHAVIOR; SERVQUAL SCALE; MARKET SHARE; EXPECTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; CONTACT	The ability of telecommunication operators to focus successfully on the customer has proven to be one of the most competitive issues toward the end of the 20th century. The services management literature is short of theoretical and empirical studies on customer satisfaction measurement in the telecommunications industry. This, however, is contrary to the industry practice since almost all major telecommunications companies around the world gather information about customer satisfaction and other related information about the quality of their services. Our research focuses on the customer satisfaction function of residential customers of a major European telecommunications company. Customer satisfaction is seen as the overall performance of the telecommunications company stemming from adequate service provision, value for money, loyalty, and relationship management. The antecedents of the performance of the organization are obtained from the contact points between the customers and the service points of the telecommunications company.

We introduce a framework based on the three T's of task, treatment, and tangibles as a means of organizing the application of the diverse and growing body of service quality literature to encounter design. The framework is consistent with how successful service managers disaggregate the design problem. More importantly, we show that mutually supportive interrelationships between the three T's produce an opportunity for designing in a robustness to service failure. The framework is supported by case based evidence.

First, we provide an economic framework to analyze the problem. Based on this framework we make a critical analysis of the objective functions used in the literature. We also question the validity of the assumption made throughout the literature that demand is exogenous and independent of customers' waiting times. We conclude that the objective functions used in the literature are appropriate only in the case of a central planner facing a demand that is unresponsive to waiting time. For other scenarios, such as a private server facing a demand that does react to waiting time, these objective functions are only shortcuts for the real objective functions that must be used. A more general model is then proposed that fits these scenarios well. Finally, we determine the impact of using the literature's objective functions on optimal appointment policies.

In particular, we focus on how exposure to Pos data may help reduce the "bullwhip effect," the tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a supply chain. Theoretical studies have shown that exposure to Pos data can lead to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers have no prior knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing Pos data in stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We find, using a controlled simulation experiment, that sharing Pos information does help reduce some components of the bullwhip effect in a stable demand setting, namely the order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one possible explanation for this improvement by examining the relationship between order decisions and demand line information.

J	Alfaro, JA; Corbett, CJ				Alfaro, JA; Corbett, CJ			The value of SKU rationalization in practice (The pooling effect under suboptimal inveiniory policies and nonnormal demand)	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pooling; stock keeping unit; SKU; rationalization; product variety; inventory management; suboptimal inventory policy	VARIABILITY REDUCTION; OPERATIONS REVERSAL; SAFETY STOCK; INVENTORY; COSTS; COMMONALITY; MODEL	Several approaches to the widely recognized challenge of managing product variety rely on the pooling effect. Pooling can be accomplished through the reduction of the number of products or stock-keeping units (SKUs), through postponement of differentiation, or in other ways. These approaches are well known and becoming widely applied in practice. However, theoretical analyses of the pooling effect assume an optimal inventory policy before pooling and after pooling, and, in most cases, that demand is normally distributed. In this article, we address the effect of nonoptimal inventory policies and the effect of nonnormally distributed demand on the value of pooling. First, we show that there is always a range of current inventory levels within which pooling is better and beyond which optimizing inventory policy is better. We also find that the value of pooling may be negative when the inventory policy in use is suboptimal. Second, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulation to examine the value of pooling for nonnormal demand distributions. We find that the value of pooling varies relatively little across the distributions we used, but that it varies considerably with the concentration of uncertainty. We also find that the ranges within which pooling is preferred over optimizing inventory policy generally are quite wide but vary considerably across distributions. Together, this indicates that the value of pooling under an optimal inventory policy is robust across distributions, but that its sensitivity to suboptimal policies is not. Third, we use a set of real (and highly erratic) demand data to analyze the benefits of pooling under optimal and suboptimal policies and nonnormal demand with a high number of SKUs. With our specific but highly nonnormal demand data, we find that pooling is beneficial and robust to suboptimal policies. Altogether, this study provides deeper theoretical, numerical, and empirical understanding of the value of pooling.

With demand forecast updates, we develop a model where raw materials are ordered from two suppliers-one fast but expensive and the other cheap but slow-and further provide an explicit solution to the resulting dynamic optimization problem. Under some mild conditions, we demonstrate that the cost function is convex and twice-differentiable with respect to order quantity. With this model, we are able to evaluate the benefit of demand information updating which leads to the identification of directions for further improvement. We further demonstrate that the model applies to multiple-period problems provided that some demand regularity conditions are satisfied. Data collected from a manufacturer support the structure and conclusion of the model.

J	Green, LV; Kolesar, PJ; Soares, J				Green, LV; Kolesar, PJ; Soares, J			An improved heuristic for staffing telephone call centers with limited operating hours	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						call-centers; staffing; queuing; non-stationary; SIPP	SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS; QUEUING-SYSTEMS; QUEUES; MULTICLASS	Many telephone call centers that experience cyclic and random customer demand adjust their staffing over the day in an attempt to provide a consistent target level of customer service. The standard and widely used staffing method, which we call the stationary independent period by period (SIPP) approach, divides the workday into planning periods and uses a series of stationary independent Erlang-c queuing models-one for each planning period-to estimate minimum staffing needs. Our research evaluates and improves upon this commonly used heuristic for those telephone call centers with limited hours of operation during the workday. We show that the SIPP approach often suggests staffing that is substantially too low to achieve the targeted customer service levels (probability of customer delay) during critical periods. The major reasons for SIPP's shortfall are as follows: (1) SIPP's failure to account for the time tag between the peak in customer demand and when system congestion actually peaks; and (2) SIPP's use of the planning period average arrival rate, thereby assuming that the arrival rate is constant during the period. We identify specific domains for which SIPP tends to suggest inadequate staffing. Based on an analysis of the factors that influence the magnitude of the lag in infinite server systems that start empty and idle, we propose and test two simple "lagged" sipp modifications that, in most situations, consistently achieve the service target with only modest increases in staffing.

A set of questions related to distribution that are uppermost in the minds of executives in this industry are presented along with a literature survey of models that can be used to answer some of these questions. Based on the survey, a normative framework for designing the distribution system is proposed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis based on the proposed framework is presented along with empirical data to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. The paper concludes with an agenda for further research.

J	Ramdas, K				Ramdas, K			Managing product variety: An integrative review and research directions	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						managing product variety; product variety; product customization; variety creation; variety implementation; future research streams	MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COST; SUPPLY-CHAIN; MASS CUSTOMIZATION; ASSORTMENT PROBLEM; HEWLETT-PACKARD; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; LINE; DIFFERENTIATION; IMPACT	Variety management has emerged as a crucial dimension of successful business practice. In this paper, I first provide a framework for managerial decisions about variety. Variety-creation decisions determine the amount, type, and timing of end-product variety, while variety-implementation decisions focus on the design and operation of internal processes and a supply chain to support a firm's variety-creation strategy. I organize variety-related decisions into four key decision themes in variety creation: 1) dimensions of variety, 2) product architecture, 3) degree of customization, and 4) timing; and three key decision themes in variety implementation: 1) process capabilities, 2) points of variegation, and 3) day-to-day decisions. I describe each theme and review the relevant literature on each theme, with a focus on research that provides insight to problems faced in practice. Finally, I identify untapped avenues for future research that would be of value to the practicing manager, paying special attention to interdependencies among decision themes.

The proposed model maximizes the firm's expected profit under the condition of the uncertainty in technological progress and development. To solve this large-scale problem, we decompose future uncertainties through scenarios and then develop an algorithm to solve the resulting non-linear subproblems efficiently. Finally, we develop a heuristic to eliminate the infeasibility in the master problem and obtain best solutions. Numerical results show that our heuristic solutions are very close to the optimal solutions and meaningful insights are derived.

J	Chiu, HN; Chen, HM; Weng, LC				Chiu, HN; Chen, HM; Weng, LC			Deterministic time-varying demand lot-sizing models with learning and forgetting in setups and production	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						learning and forgetting effects; setups and production; lot-sizing models; discrete time-varying demand; learning		We study the deterministic time-varying demand lot-sizing problem in which learning and forgetting in setups and production are considered simultaneously. It is an extension of Chiu's work. We propose a near-optimal forward dynamic programming algorithm and suggest the use of a good heuristic method in a situation in which the computational effort is extremely intolerable. Several important observations obtained from a two-phase experiment verify the goodness of the proposed algorithm and the chosen heuristic method.

J	Gaimon, C; Burgess, RH				Gaimon, C; Burgess, RH			Analysis of the lead time and learning for capacity expansions	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity expansion; lead time; learning; time-based competition	NUCLEAR-POWER; UNCERTAINTY; DECISIONS; CURVES; MODEL	Firms capable of reducing the time required to bring new products to the marketplace realize significant competitive gains. In this context, the existing literature on capacity expansion is limited because it does not consider the lead time required to construct and operationalize new capacity. Models are introduced here that capture the capacity expansion lead time as well as two types of learning. Specifically, learning may reduce the lead time or cost required to complete an expansion. Analytic and numerical results show that the optimal solution can be significantly affected by the explicit treatment of the lead time and learning.
