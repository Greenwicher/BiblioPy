The proposed process model is comprised of a set of entities representing the e-service system, a network defining the linking between all pairs of entities via transactions and product flows, and a set of outcomes of the processes in terms of quality dimensions. The process model is developed using Unified Modeling Language (UML), a pictorial language for specifying service designs that has achieved widespread acceptance among e-service designers. Examples of applications of the process model are presented to illustrate how the model can be use to identify operational levers for managing and improving e-service quality.

Unfortunately, existing research has been limited in providing information to support prescriptive approaches for applying specific service recovery techniques. By using data from a large sample (n = 861) of service failure incidents and employing the use of hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis, this exploratory study creates and analyzes empirical types of service failures. The derived failure types, or common situations faced by service providers, focus on customer loyalty and the severity of the failure, and may be visualized in a two-by-two matrix. Regression analysis is then used to demonstrate how effective recovery strategies and supporting activities should vary, based on the location of the failure within the matrix. The approach and results offer important implications for strategy and service support activities as well as a foundation for systematizing service recovery efforts.

They then must attempt to modify the planned work schedule to improve service and increase profitability. This study, which defines such a setting as the real-time work schedule adjustment decision, proposes mathematical formulations of the real-time adjustment and develops efficient heuristic approaches for this decision. The study evaluates the relative effectiveness of these heuristics versus experienced service managers, investigates the effect of the degree of schedule adjustment on profitability, and assesses the effect of demand forecast update errors on the performance of the schedule adjustment efforts. First, the results indicate that the computer based heuristics achieve higher profit improvement than experienced managers. Second, there is a trade-off between schedule stability and profitability so that more extensive schedule revisions (efficiency first heuristics) generally result in higher profitability. However, the incremental return on schedule changes is diminishing. Third, we find that active adjustments of work schedules are beneficial as long as the direction of demand change is accurately identified.

We test the accuracy of the simulation by verifying the results in Chen et al. (2000a) and Dejonckheere et al. (2004). We find that lead-time variability exacerbates variance amplification in a supply chain, and that information sharing and information quality are highly significant. For example, using the assumptions in Chen et al. (2000a) and Dejonckheere et al. (2004), we find in a numerical experiment of a customer-retailer-wholesaler-distributor-factory supply chain that variance amplification is attenuated by nearly 50 percent at the factory due to information sharing. Other assumptions we make are based on interviews or conversations with managers at large supply chains.

J	Rosenzweig, ED; Roth, AV				Rosenzweig, ED; Roth, AV			Towards a theory of competitive progression: Evidence from high-tech manufacturing	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing strategy; competitive progression theory; competitive capabilities; high-tech manufacturing; empirical research	TRADE-OFFS; EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION; VOLUME FLEXIBILITY; CORPORATE-STRATEGY; CAPABILITIES; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; QUALITY; KNOWLEDGE; DIMENSIONS	This study replicates and extends Ferdows and De Meyers' observed 'sand cone' model of cumulative competitive capabilities by means of Roth's related competitive progression theory (CPT). Using path analysis, we model and test the relationships among the generic competitive capability constructs of conformance quality, delivery reliability, volume flexibility, and low cost as predicted by CPT. Our results, drawn from a sample of high-tech manufacturers, provide further evidence that on average, these four capabilities are acquired both cumulatively and in that sequence. We also find that each generic capability increases operational know-how and reduces non-value-added directly and/or indirectly through the enhancement of successive capabilities in the progression, which in turn improves profitability. The paper contributes a theoretical rationale for the observed sand cone effect, describes how the competitive progression acts to influence accelerated organizational learning over an innovation cycle, and offers evidence that combinative capabilities have strategic value for high-tech manufacturers.

J	Anand, G; Ward, PT				Anand, G; Ward, PT			Fit, flexibility and performance in manufacturing: Coping with dynamic environments	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						environmental dynamism; flexibility; fit	CORPORATE STRATEGY; EMPIRICAL-TEST; UNCERTAINTY; DIMENSIONS; OPERATIONS; INDUSTRY; ORGANIZATIONS; DETERMINANTS; CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT	This research develops the notion of environmental fit and flexibility and illustrates the importance of such fit empirically using survey data from 101 manufacturing firms. Two dimensions of environmental dynamism are identified and the fit between them and different approaches to flexibility are assessed. Hierarchical regressions provide evidence that flexibility is a stronger predictor of performance in more dynamic environments. Specifically, presence of the unpredictability or the volatility aspects of environmental dynamism each warrant the use of different types of manufacturing flexibility strategies. Statistical results are interpreted with the caveat that while implemented capability must be used to study performance effects, this study uses perceived importance scales for flexibility.

J	Gavish, B; Kalvenes, J				Gavish, B; Kalvenes, J			Dynamic policies for optimal LEO satellite launches	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						scheduling and sequencing; replenishment; inventory management	CONSTELLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Low-earth orbit satellite (LEO) systems continue to provide mobile communication services. The issue of cost containment in system maintenance is a critical factor for continued operation. Satellite finite life-times follow a stochastic process, and since satellite replenishment cost is the most significant on-going cost of operation, finding optimal launch policies is of paramount importance. This paper formulates the satellite launch problem as a Markovian decision model that can be solved using dynamic programming. The policy space of the system is enormous and traditional action space dominance rules do not apply. In order to solve the dynamic program for realistic problem sizes, a novel procedure for limiting the state space considered in the dynamic program is developed. The viability of the proposed solution procedure is demonstrated in example problems using realistic system data. The policies derived by the proposed solution procedure are superior to those currently considered by LEO system operators, and result in substantial annual cost savings.

J	Sampson, SE				Sampson, SE			Practical implications of preference-based conference scheduling	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						scheduling; optimization; service operations; services	SCHOOL TIMETABLING PROBLEM; PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION; TABU SEARCH; CONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM	Conference scheduling involves organizing presentations into sessions which are assigned to time periods and rooms. This includes assuring a feasible utilization of time periods and rooms, and avoiding individual schedule conflicts. The problem increases in complexity by considering the preferences of presenters: for time periods, for rooms, etc. A greater level of complexity comes from considering the preferences of conference attendees, which we define as preference-based conference scheduling (PBCS). This article provides a structure on which PBCS problems are founded, including empirical demonstration of solution techniques. In addition, real-world strategic planning issues of flexibility and preference detail are explored.

J	Tsikriktsis, N; Lanzolla, G; Frohlich, M				Tsikriktsis, N; Lanzolla, G; Frohlich, M			Adoption of e-processes by service firms: An empirical study of antecedents	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-transactions; e-CRM; e-service; technology adoption; empirical research	E-BUSINESS; NETWORK EXTERNALITIES; TECHNOLOGICAL DISCONTINUITIES; DOMINANT DESIGNS; INNOVATION; DIFFUSION; STRATEGY; MODEL; COMPATIBILITY; ORGANIZATIONS	This paper investigates empirically antecedents of the adoption of web-based processes (e-processes) by service providers. We examine whether rational efficiency (expressed by expected performance benefits and access to new markets), the bandwagon effect (expressed by external pressure), and barriers (both internal and customer related) influence Internet use for transactions (e-transactions) and/or to extend the relationships between service providers and their customers (e-CRM). The findings, based on a sample of 338 service firms, show that rational efficiency and the bandwagon effect drive both types of e-processes. Conversely, only internal barriers have a negative impact on adoption of e-processes, while barriers related to customers do not have a significant impact. These findings have important academic and managerial implications, given the limited evidence regarding the implementation of e-processes in services.

Volume flexibility in a health care setting represents a means to improve service delivery and it allows organizations to leverage their scarce resources for optimal utilization in response to fluctuations in patient demand. This paper develops a research framework that describes four volume flexible strategies based on literature reviews and structured field interviews of health care administrators at a Carnegie I research and teaching hospital.

Two models are introduced that establish a conceptual framework linking firm profit to attributes of the IT-worker system. The framework considers the impact of IT capabilities (such as functionality and ease-of-use) and worker skill as drivers of output volume and quality. The framework contrasts attributes of the IT-worker systems when services are mass-produced (flow shop) versus customized (job shop). Mathematical models are introduced to formalize the conceptual framework. Numerical examples are presented that illustrate the types of insights that can be obtained from the models.

The main finding is that at national level ISO 14000 certification densities can be explained by two factors: the installed base of ISO 9000 certificates and the number of environmental treaties signed and ratified. The first factor, considering the common elements of the two standards, points to conditions of infrastructural convenience, while the second highlights the importance of political-economic considerations. The study uses a new set of tools (graphical displays, distribution-free computer intensive methods) that are better suited for exploratory research when discontinuities and existence of subgroups in the data set may make findings from a linear regression suspect.

We found that ISO 9000 certification levels, environmental treaties ratified, and exports as a proportion of GDP were the main significant variables, where the environmental measure may be moderated by GDP per capita. In his replication study, Vastag (2004, in this issue) analyzes the same data using more visual techniques, specifically regression trees, and finds support for the significance of ISO 9000 certification levels and environmental treaties ratified, but not for export-propensity. Vastag raises a number of relevant methodological issues, to which we add some perspectives here.

Factors influencing cell penetration in manufacturing plants	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cellular manufacturing; implementation obstacles; survey study; manufacturing	GROUP TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS	There is little understanding as to why firms have various degrees of cell usage. The intent of this study was to identify factors that had arrested continued implementation of cells at surveyed manufacturing plants. We found no dominant factor that had prevented the firms from continued cellularization. However, by sub-dividing the plants into those with low and high degrees of direct labor hours spent in cells, short and long experience with cells, and those with and without plans for further cells, a clearer pattern emerged. The inability to find families with high and stable demand, lack of time to implement more cells, the existence of service processes, and the difficulty of cost justifying new cells were the most important factors, although their relative importance varied. The findings support the notion that cellular manufacturing has broad applicability as a form of work organization and that cell users pursue further implementations until no more viable cells with sufficient utilization, demand stability, or economic value can be found.

These articles focus primarily on defining and describing these frontiers and raise questions concerning how to improve operations. In this paper, we provide one of the first empirical studies aimed at validating these earlier studies. Using a database on the 10 largest U.S. airlines for a period of 11 years, we test and validate some of the models presented in the operations literature. The 10 major airlines are separated into 2 groups for analysis: geographic specialists and geographic generalists. Our analysis shows that better Performing airlines (in terms of cost-quality position) in both groups confirm the predictions of the sand cone model when operating further away from their asset frontiers, although trade-offs do occur when operating close to asset frontiers.

We take up this issue and begin with defining a coordinating contract as one that results in a Pareto-optimal solution acceptable to each agent. Our definition generalizes the standard one in the risk-neutral case. We then develop coordinating contracts in three specific cases: (i) the supplier is risk neutral and the retailer maximizes his expected profit subject to a downside risk constraint; (ii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own mean-variance trade-off; and (iii) the supplier and the retailer each maximizes his own expected utility. Moreover, in case (iii), we show that our contract yields the Nash Bargaining solution. In each case, we show how we can find the set of Pareto-optimal solutions, and then design a contract to achieve the solutions. We also exhibit a case in which we obtain Pareto-optimal sharing rules explicitly, and outline a procedure to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions.

J	Warburton, RDH				Warburton, RDH			An analytical investigation of the bullwhip effect	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; OPTIMIZATION; INVENTORIES; VOLATILITY	The Bullwhip Effect is problematic: order variability increases as orders propagate along the supply chain. The fundamental differential delay equations for a retailer's inventory reacting to a surge in demand are solved exactly. Much of the rich and complex inventory behavior is determined by the replenishment delay. The analytical solutions agree with numerical integrations and previous control theory results. Managerially useful ordering strategies are proposed. Exact expressions are derived for the retailer's orders to the manufacturer, and the Bullwhip Effect arises naturally. The approach is quite general and applicable to a wide variety of supply chain problems.

J	Hazra, J; Mahadevan, B; Seshadri, S				Hazra, J; Mahadevan, B; Seshadri, S			Capacity allocation among multiple suppliers in an electronic market	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity allocation; multiple sourcing; electronic market; vendor selection; supply chain management; e-commerce		An electronic marketplace typically provides industrial suppliers an alternative option for selling their capacity in addition to the traditional open market. However, suppliers face different sets of costs and risks in open market and in electronic market. Consequently, suppliers participating in an electronic market are likely to offer their capacity at a different price compared with traditional open market. We analyze this problem and derive the price-capacity function for the supplier. We also derive a basis for allocating buyer's requirements among multiple suppliers so as to minimize his cost. Our model shows that suppliers with large capacities would quote a lower price in the electronic market. It also predicts that the unit bid price increases with bid quantity in the electronic market. Based on the price-capacity curve, we model a scenario where the buyer announces, a priori, the number of suppliers to be selected for award of a contract that will minimize its costs.

This, however, would mean continual variations in production quantities, and component orders from suppliers. A flexible manufacturing system can help alleviate costs related to modification of production quantities. The capacity of such a system, however, has to be limited because of high investment cost. Further, unless there is a long-term relationship, suppliers may levy a high surcharge for last minute changes in order size. We model a hybrid control policy comprising an advance (pre-production) order size agreed upon with suppliers, and a provision for real-time order revision at a given rate of surcharge. We show that a rank-order of products can be used for real-time revisions, and that a strong buyer-supplier relationship that keeps these surcharges low can actually help increase profits for both parties. We study issues such as compatibility between JIT and flexibility, and the impact of market conditions on overall profitability.

Product plant networks offer the benefits of consolidated production and reduced transshipment costs; on the other hand, process plant networks allow intensive dedication to process expertise and economics of scale. In this paper, we show that, aside from these benefits, process plant networks offer significant risk pooling advantages under a wide range of conditions. We analytically demonstrate that, even without accounting for economics of scale advantages, firms may prefer the process plant network configuration due to the risk pooling benefits offered.

Central to this theme is the need for firms to look outside of their organizations for opportunities to collaborate and coordinate with partners to ensure that the supply chain is both efficient and responsive to dynamic market needs. Such collaboration and coordination opportunities introduce new challenges and complexities as a result of increased problem scale and scope, and potentially conflicting incentives among different supply chain players. Motivated by these new challenges, this special issue explores a range of coordination and collaboration problems, stressing the role of information and associated technologies in facilitating and enabling supply chain integration.

We assume that the business environment forces supply chains to charge similar prices and to compete strictly on the basis of customer service. We model customer service competition using game-theoretical concepts. We consider three competition scenarios between the supply chains. In the uncoordinated scenario, individual members of both supply chains maximize their own profits by individually selecting their service and inventory policies. In the coordinated scenario, wholesalers and retailers of each supply chain coordinate their service and inventory policy decisions to maximize supply chain profits. In the hybrid scenario, competition is between one coordinated and one uncoordinated supply chain. We discuss the derivation of the equilibrium service strategies, resulting inventory policies, and profits for each scenario, and compare the equilibria in a numerical study. We find that coordination is a dominant strategy for both supply chains, but as in the prisoner's dilemma, both supply chains are often worse off under the coordinated scenario relative to the uncoordinated scenario. The consumers are the only guaranteed beneficiaries of coordination.

J	Gerchak, Y; Wang, YZ				Gerchak, Y; Wang, YZ			Revenue-sharing vs. wholesale-price contracts in assembly systems with random demand	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; assembly systems; revenue-sharing contract; wholesale-price contract	GOODS	Assembly and kitting operations, as well as jointly sold products, are rather basic yet intriguing decentralized supply chains, where achieving coordination through appropriate incentives is very important, especially when demand is uncertain. We investigate two very distinct types of arrangements between an assembler/retailer and its suppliers. One scheme is a vendor-managed inventory with revenue sharing, and the other a wholesale-price driven contract. In the VMI case, each supplier faces strategic uncertainty as to the amounts of components, which need to be mated with its own, that other suppliers will deliver. We explore the resulting components' delivery quantities equilibrium in this decentralized supply chain and its implications for participants' and system's expected profits. We derive the revenue shares the assembler should select in order to maximize its own profits. We then explore a revenue-plus-surplus-subsidy incentive scheme, where, in addition to a share of revenue, the assembler also provides a subsidy to component suppliers for their unsold components. We show that, by using this two-parameter contract, the assembler can achieve channel coordination and increase the profits of all parties involved. We then explore a wholesale-price-driven scheme, both as a single lever and in combination with buybacks. The channel performance of a wholesale-price-only scheme is shown to degrade with the number of suppliers, which is not the case with a revenue-share-only contract.

In the first strategy, the firm does not pass along the discount to its customers (sales subsidiaries); the firm simply coordinates purchasing and production among the different factories to take advantage of this one-time price discount. In the second strategy, the firm offers price discounts for its most profitable products in different sales subsidiaries to increase their demand. We carried out experiments for the two strategies based on a mathematical programming model, built around Toshiba's global notebook supply chain. Model constraints include, among others, material constraints, bill-of-materials, capacity and transportation constraints, minimum lot size constraints, and a constraint on minimum fill rate (service level constraint). Unlike most models of this type in the literature, which define variables in terms of single arc flows, we employ path variables, which allow for direct identification and manipulation of profitable and non-profitable products.

J	Kraiselburd, S; Narayanan, VG; Raman, A				Kraiselburd, S; Narayanan, VG; Raman, A			Contracting in a supply chain with Stochastic demand and substitute products	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; incentives; substitute products; vendor-managed inventory	REPLENISHMENT; COORDINATION; COMPETITION; POLICIES	Retailers often stock competing products from multiple manufacturers. When the retailer stocks out of a particular item, customers who prefer the item are likely, with some probability, to switch to a substitute product from another manufacturer at the same store. In such an event, a "lost sale" for the manufacturer is not a "lost sale" for the retailer. This exacerbates differences in manufacturer's and retailer's stockout costs for the item. Such differences in stockout cost influence the optimal contract between the manufacturer and the retailer and also impose agency costs on the channel. Such contracts, in turn, determine equilibrium inventory levels and fill rates. We study these issues in a single-period supply chain, consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, under three different scenarios (when the two firms are integrated into a single entity, when the retailer makes stocking decisions, and when the manufacturer makes stocking decisions). We compare, and present a methodology for comparing, stocking quantities, manufacturer efforts, and supply chain profits across different scenarios. We find that VMI performs better when manufacturer effort is a substantial driver of consumer demand and when consumers are unlikely to substitute to another brand in case of a stockout. On the other hand, if non-contractible manufacturer effort is unimportant, or when substitution is significant, VMI can exacerbate, rather than mitigate, channel inefficiencies, and can perform worse than traditional Retailer Managed Inventory.

J	Shin, HJ; Benton, WC				Shin, HJ; Benton, WC			Quantity discount-based inventory coordination: Effectiveness and critical environmental factors	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						discounts; supply management; inventory coordination; simulation	PRICING MODEL; PROFITS; POLICY	It is understood that quantity discounts provide a practical foundation for coordinating inventory decisions in supply chains. The primary objective of this research is to test, under a variety of environmental conditions, the effectiveness of quantity discounts as an inventory coordination mechanism between a buyer and a supplier. A comprehensive simulation experiment with ANOVA has been designed to investigate the impacts of (1) choice of quantity discount-based inventory coordination policies, (2) magnitude of demand variation, (3) buyer's and supplier's relative inventory cost structure, and (4) buyer's economic time-between-orders on the effectiveness of supply chain inventory coordination. The analytical results confirm that the quantity discount policies have managerial properties as a mediator for inventory coordination. The results also show that the performance of quantity discount-based inventory coordination policies is influenced significantly by environmental factors, such as the magnitude of demand variation, the buyer's and the supplier's inventory cost structure, and the buyer's economic time-between-orders.

It first gives an overview of the various planning and scheduling models that have been studied in the literature, including lot sizing models and machine scheduling models. It subsequently categorizes the various industrial sectors in which planning and scheduling in the supply chains are important; these industries include continuous manufacturing as well as discrete manufacturing. We then describe how planning and scheduling models can be used in the design and the development of decision support systems for planning and scheduling in supply chains and discuss in detail the implementation of such a system at the Carlsberg A/S beerbrewer in Denmark. We conclude with a discussion on the current trends in the design and the implementation of planning and scheduling systems in practice.

J	Tsay, AA; Agrawal, N				Tsay, AA; Agrawal, N			Channel conflict and coordination in the E-commerce age	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						retail sales; direct sales; catalog sales; resellers; intermediaries; electronic commerce; Internet commerce; channels of distribution; dual distribution; channel conflict; supply chain management coordination; mathematical modeling; game theory	RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE; SERVICE; SYSTEM; MODEL; INFORMATION; RETAILERS; LOGISTICS	A number of factors, including developments in Internet-based commerce and third-party logistics, have led many companies to consider engaging in direct sales. Such a company may at once be both a supplier to and a direct competitor of any existing reseller partners (e.g., land-based retailers), which can result in "channel conflict." This can have momentous implications for distribution strategy. To generate managerial insights into this important issue, we develop a model that captures key attributes of such a setting, including various sources of inefficiency. We examine these in detail and identify a number of counterintuitive structural properties. For instance, the addition of a direct channel alongside a reseller channel is not necessarily detrimental to the reseller, given the associated adjustment in the manufacturer's pricing. In fact, both parties can benefit. Finally, we examine ways to adjust the manufacturer-reseller relationship that have been observed in industry. These include changes in wholesale pricing, paying the reseller a commission for diverting customers toward the direct channel, or conceding the demand fulfillment function entirely to the reseller. The latter two schemes could be mutually beneficial in that they achieve a division of labor according to each channel's competitive advantage.

In this model, no player has complete knowledge about all the costs and constraints of the other players. The decision-making framework employs an iterative procedure, based on the Integer L-shaped method, in which a master problem is solved to propose global solutions, and each player uses his local problems to construct feasibility and optimality cuts on the master problem. The master problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, and the players' local problems are formulated as linear programs. Collaborative planning scenarios in private e-marketplaces and in supply chains were formulated and solved for test data. The results show that this distributed model is able to achieve near-optimal solutions considerably faster than the traditional centralized approach.
