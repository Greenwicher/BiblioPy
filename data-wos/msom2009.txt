J	Gupta, D; Wang, L				Gupta, Diwakar; Wang, Lei			A Stochastic Inventory Model with Trade Credit	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						trade credit; finance and inventory models	ECONOMIC ORDER QUANTITY; TERMS SUPPLIER CREDIT; PERMISSIBLE DELAY; FINANCIAL DECISIONS; PAYMENTS; POLICY; EOQ	Suppliers routinely sell goods to retailers on credit. Common credit terms are tantamount to a schedule of declining discounts (escalating penalties) that depend on how long the retailer takes to pay off the supplier's loan. However, issues such as which stocking policies are optimal in the presence of supplier-provided credit have been investigated only when demand is assumed deterministic. Nearly all stochastic inventory models assume either time-invariant finance charges or charges that may vary with time but not with the age of the credit. In this article we present a discrete time model of the retailer's operations with random demand, which is used to prove that the structure of the optimal policy is not affected by credit terms, although the value of the optimal policy parameter is. This is followed by a continuous time model, which leads to an algorithm for finding the optimal stock level. We also model the supplier's problem and calculate the optimal credit parameters in numerical experiments.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.

J	Beil, DR; Wein, LM				Beil, Damian R.; Wein, Lawrence M.			A Pooling Analysis of Two Simultaneous Online Auctions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						auctions; bidding; pooling	INTERNET	Motivated by the ease with which online customers can bid simultaneously in multiple auctions, we analyze a system with two competing auctioneers and three types of bidders: those dedicated to either of the two auctions and those that participate simultaneously in both auctions. Bidding behavior is specified and proven to induce a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and a closed-form expression for the expected revenue of each auctioneer is derived. For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling-i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%-65% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling. Pooling's impact on revenue decreases with the number of bidders, suggesting that popular auction sites need not be overly concerned with mitigating bidding across auctions.

J	Anderson, SW; Baggett, LS; Widener, SK				Anderson, Shannon W.; Baggett, L. Scott; Widener, Sally K.			The Impact of Service Operations Failures on Customer Satisfaction: Evidence on How Failures and Their Source Affect What Matters to Customers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; customer satisfaction; attribution theory; failure recovery; airline industry	AIRLINE INDUSTRY; CONTACT; DESIGN; RECOVERY; QUALITY	Research in consumer psychology shows that customers seek reasons for service failures and that attributions of blame moderate the effects of failure on the level of customer satisfaction. This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U. S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we and that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.

In this model the processing of a job may involve several distinct operations. Alternative processing modes are also allowed. Given a finite planning horizon, attention is focused on the two-level problem of capacity choice and dynamic system control. A pointwise stationary fluid model (PSFM) is used to approximate system dynamics, which allows development of practical policies with a manageable computational burden. Earlier work in more restrictive settings suggests that our method is asymptotically optimal in a parameter regime of practical interest, but this paper contains no formal limit theory. Rather, it develops a PSFM calculus that is broadly accessible, with an emphasis on modeling and practical computation.

Multimarket Facility Network Design with Offshoring Applications	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity investment; newsvendor network; location; transshipment; commonality	PLANT LOCATION; FLEXIBILITY; UNCERTAINTY; RISK; STRATEGIES; DIVERSIFICATION; COMMONALITY; MITIGATION; DECISION; BUSINESS	Moving production to low-wage countries may reduce manufacturing costs, but it increases logistics costs and is subject to foreign trade barriers, among others. This paper studies a manufacturer's multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assemblies. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different economic and demand characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted, in which market should the facility be located? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region.

J	Swinney, R; Netessine, S				Swinney, Robert; Netessine, Serguei			Long-Term Contracts Under the Threat of Supplier Default	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; financial default; contracting; game theory	UNITED-STATES; PROCUREMENT; COMPETITION; INVESTMENT; INDUSTRY; CHAINS; RISK	Contracting with suppliers prone to default is an increasingly common problem in some industries, particularly automotive manufacturing. We model this phenomenon as a two-period contracting game with two identical suppliers, a single buyer, deterministic demand, and uncertain production costs. The suppliers are distressed at the start of the game and do not have access to external sources of capital; hence, revenues from the buyer are crucial in determining whether default occurs. The production cost of each supplier is the sum of two stochastic components: a common term that is identical for both suppliers (representing raw materials costs, design specifications, etc.) and an idiosyncratic term that is unique to a given supplier (representing inherent firm capability). The buyer chooses a supplier and then decides on a single-or two-period contract. Comparing models with and without the possibility of default, we find that, without the possibility of supplier failure, the buyer always prefers short-term contracts over long-term contracts, whereas this preference is typically reversed in the presence of failure. Neither of these contracts coordinates the supply chain. We also consider dynamic contracts, in which the contract price is partially tied to some index representing the common component of production costs (e. g., commodity prices of raw materials such as steel or oil), allowing the buyer to shoulder some of the risk from cost uncertainty. We find that dynamic long-term contracts allow the buyer to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of default risk. We also demonstrate that our results continue to hold under a variety of alternative assumptions, including stochastic demand, allowing the buyer the option of subsidizing a bankrupt supplier via a contingent transfer payment or loan and allowing the buyer to unilaterally renegotiate contracts. We conclude that the possibility of supplier default offers a new reason to prefer long-term contracts over short-term contracts.

The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information).

In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels. For example, we find that tracking product-based (as opposed to component-based) return information appears to provide much less value than tracking product-based demand information, and we explore the impact of the number of products, component lead times, and different patterns of component returns (joint versus independent returns, returns of common versus dedicated components) on the value of component commonality.

For these institutions, these events are making more urgent the decision of how to staff a check-clearing house to trade off efficiency and the expected costs associated with the risks of delayed checks, which include fraud and. oat costs. In this paper, we discuss how a team of executives at a major commercial bank (CB) and Carnegie Mellon University students and faculty engaged in conducting a model-based study of the CB check-clearing operations. This project culminated in the development of a simulation optimization model to systematically analyze the nature of the highlighted risk efficiency trade-off at CB. The firm used the model recommendations to obtain operations downsizing guidelines for its senior managers during the implementation of a strategic workforce reduction program at their check-clearing house. The managerial insights from the team analysis, and the specific model-based recommendations, enabled CB executives to balance risk and efficiency while planning the reduction of their check-processing workforce.

In our framework, the first order is placed at the start of the preseason and delivered at the start of the selling season; the second order is placed at or after the start of the selling season for subsequent delivery. Under this framework, the decision maker must make three interrelated choices: the first order quantity, when to place the second order, and the second order quantity. Our focus is on elucidating the optimal policy structure for the three interrelated decisions. By casting our models as sequential decision-making problems, we are able to reduce the optimization problems into sequential and embedded searches for the concerned decision variables that allow us to identify the conditions on the economic parameters and demand distribution to effectively facilitate the search for the optimal solutions.

J	Veeraraghavan, S; Debo, L				Veeraraghavan, Senthil; Debo, Laurens			Joining Longer Queues: Information Externalities in Queue Choice	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						customer herding; behavioral operations; information externalities; market dynamics; private signals; service capacity		A classic example that illustrates how observed customer behavior impacts other customers' decisions is the selection of a restaurant whose quality is uncertain. Customers often choose the busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not. In an environment with random arrival and service times, customer behavior is reflected in the lengths of the queues that form at the individual servers. Therefore, queue lengths could signal two factors-potentially higher arrivals to the server or potentially slower service at the server. In this paper, we focus on both factors when customers' waiting costs are negligible. This allows us to understand how information externalities due to congestion impact customers' service choice behavior. In our model, based on private information about both the service-quality and queue-length information, customers decide which queue to join. When the service rates are the same and known, we confirm that it may be rational to ignore private information and purchase from the service provider with the longer queue when only one additional customer is present in the longer queue. We find that, due to the information externalities contained in queue lengths, there exist cycles during which one service firm is thriving whereas the other is not. Which service provider is thriving depends on luck; i.e., it is determined by the private signal of the customer arriving when both service providers are idle. These phenomena continue to hold when each service facility has multiple servers, or when a facility may go out of business when it cannot attract customers for a certain amount of time. Finally, we find that when the service rates are unknown but are negatively correlated with service values, our results are strengthened; long queues are now doubly informative. The market share of the high-quality firm is higher when there is service rate uncertainty, and it increases as the service rate decreases. When the service rates are positively correlated with unknown service values, long queues become less informative and customers might even join shorter queues.

Cournot Competition Under Yield Uncertainty: The Case of the US Influenza Vaccine Market	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cournot competition; influenza vaccine; yield uncertainty; market structure	DIVERSIFICATION; ENTRY	This paper is inspired by the recurring mismatch between demand and supply in the U. S. influenza vaccine market. Economic theory predicts that an oligopolistic market with unregulated but costly entry will experience excess entry and oversupply, not the undersupply observed in the market for influenza vaccine in recent years. In this paper, we examine the interaction between yield uncertainty, a key characteristic of many production processes, including that for influenza vaccine, and firms' strategic behavior. We find that yield uncertainty can contribute to a high degree of concentration in an industry and a reduction in the industry output and the expected consumer surplus in equilibrium. We use parameter values loosely based on the U. S. influenza vaccine market to numerically illustrate the impact of yield uncertainty.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace.

J	Su, XM				Su, Xuanming			Consumer Returns Policies and Supply Chain Performance	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						consumer returns; supply chains; valuation uncertainty; newsvendor model; supply contracts	MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; INVENTORY SYSTEM; PRODUCT RETURNS; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; GOODS	This paper develops a model of consumer returns policies. In our model, consumers face valuation uncertainty and realize their valuations only after purchase. There is also aggregate demand uncertainty, captured using the conventional newsvendor model. In this environment, consumers decide whether to purchase and then whether to return the product, whereas the seller sets the price, quantity, and refund amount. Using our model, we study the impact of full returns policies (e.g., using 100% money-back guarantees) and partial returns policies (e.g., when restocking fees are charged) on supply chain performance. Next, we demonstrate that consumer returns policies may distort incentives under common supply contracts (such as manufacturer buy-backs), and we propose strategies to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of consumer returns. Finally, we explore several extensions and demonstrate the robustness of our findings.

We present structural results that characterize the interaction between the decision to hold a sale and the inventory-ordering decision. We show that the optimal inventory-ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy; however, the optimal pricing policy can be quite complicated due to both the value and the cost of holding inventory and delaying sales. In our computational analysis, we find that compared to a fixed-price policy, we see an average gain in profit of almost 5% from optimally varying promotion and inventory decisions accounting for intertemporal demand, and we find that this potential profit gain increases as demand variability decreases.

J	Groer, C; Golden, B; Wasil, E				Groer, Chris; Golden, Bruce; Wasil, Edward			The Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						vehicle routing; customer service; logistics	DISPATCHING PROBLEM	In the small package shipping industry (as in other industries), companies try to differentiate themselves by providing high levels of customer service. This can be accomplished in several ways, including online tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pickups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and have the same drivers visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements, together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length, de. ne a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we call the consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal mixed-integer program solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. We provide a technique for generating ConVRP benchmark problems from vehicle routing problem instances given in the literature and provide our solutions to these instances. The solutions produced by our algorithm on all problems do a very good job of meeting customer service objectives with routes that have a low total travel time.

Managing Service Systems with an Offline Waiting Option and Customer Abandonment	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; customer abandonment; customer impatience; reneging; offline waiting; choice models; heavy traffic	CALL-BACK OPTION; CONTACT CENTERS; TIME; QUEUES; DELAYS	Many service providers offer customers the choice of either waiting in a line or going offline and returning at a dynamically determined future time. The best-known example is the FASTPASS (R) system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.

Under assumptions about the forecasts, the demand process, and the supply chain structure, we show that safety-stock placement for such systems is effectively equivalent to the corresponding well-studied problem for systems with stationary demand bounds and base-stock policies. Hence, we can use existing algorithms to find the optimal safety stocks. We use a case study with real data to demonstrate that there are significant benefits from the inclusion of the forecast process when determining the optimal safety stocks. We also conduct a computational experiment to explore how the placement and size of the safety stocks depend on the nature of the forecast evolution process.

J	Argon, NT; Ziya, S				Argon, Nilay Tanik; Ziya, Serhan			Priority Assignment Under Imperfect Information on Customer Type Identities	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						priority queues; partially observable customer types; service differentiation; triage	CALL-CENTER; QUEUE; SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; OPERATIONS; SERVERS	In many service systems, customers are not served in the order they arrive, but according to a priority scheme that ranks them with respect to their relative "importance." However, it may not be an easy task to determine the importance level of customers, especially when decisions need to be made under limited information. A typical example is from health care: When triage nurses classify patients into different priority groups, they must promptly determine each patient's criticality levels with only partial information on their conditions. We consider such a service system where customers are from one of two possible types. The service time and waiting cost for a customer depends on the customer's type. Customers' type identities are not directly available to the service provider; however, each customer provides a signal, which is an imperfect indicator of the customer's identity. The service provider uses these signals to determine priority levels for the customers with the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost. In most of the paper, each customer's signal equals the probability that the customer belongs to the type that should have a higher priority and customers incur waiting costs that are linear in time. We first show that increasing the number of priority classes decreases costs, and the policy that gives the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal outperforms any finite class priority policy. We then focus on two-class priority policies and investigate how the optimal policy changes with the system load. We also investigate the properties of "good" signals and find that signals that are larger in convex ordering are more preferable. In a simulation study, we find that when the waiting cost functions are nondecreasing, quadratic, and convex, the policy that assigns the highest priority to the customer with the highest signal performs poorly while the two-class priority policy and an extension of the generalized c mu rule perform well.

J	Besbes, O; Savin, S				Besbes, Omar; Savin, Sergei			Going Bunkers: The Joint Route Selection and Refueling Problem	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						routing; shipping; refueling; stochastic prices; maritime transportation	EDGEWORTH PRICE CYCLES; CRUDE-OIL; FUEL-MANAGEMENT; MODEL; INVESTMENTS; ENVIRONMENT; MARKET	Managing shipping vessel profitability is a central problem in marine transportation. We consider two commonly used types of vessels-"liners" (ships whose routes are fixed in advance) and "trampers" (ships for which future route components are selected based on available shipping jobs)-and formulate a vessel profit maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces to the problem of minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a characterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where prices are constant through time and do not differ across ports and prices are constant through time and differ across ports. The structure of the optimal policy in such special cases yields insights on the complexity of the problem and also guides the construction of heuristics for the general problem setting.

J	Hsu, VN; Xu, SH; Jukic, B				Hsu, Vernon N.; Xu, Susan H.; Jukic, Boris			Optimal Scheduling and Incentive Compatible Pricing for a Service System with Quality of Service Guarantees	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity planning and investment; technology management and process design; service operations	QUEUING-SYSTEMS; EQUILIBRIUM; ADMISSION; FACILITY; QUEUES	This paper proposes a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for a service system that serves multiple classes of jobs within an organization. Each class of service request is subject to a class-dependent quality of service (QoS) guarantee on the expected delay bound, which may be imposed by business rules in an organization or other application-specific technical constraints. We develop an extension of a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for an M/M/1 system. In contrast to the system without the QoS guarantee, where a fixed priority scheduling policy-known as the c mu rule-is optimal, we show that the system may need to adopt a more general randomized priority scheduling policy to maximize the overall system profit. We also develop a transfer pricing scheme that is both optimal and incentive compatible, allowing users to act in their self-interests while collectively achieving the system optimum. We show that the pricing scheme with the QoS guarantee depends on the scheduling policy implemented and has different characteristics from that without the QoS guarantee.

The main estimators considered are: (i) the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES), (ii) the delay experienced so far by the customer at the head of the line (HOL), and (iii) the delay experienced by the customer to have arrived most recently among those who have already completed service (RCS). We compare these delay-history estimators to the standard estimator based on the queue length (QL), commonly used in practice, which requires knowledge of the mean interval between successive service completions in addition to the QL. We characterize performance by the mean squared error (MSE). We do an analysis and conduct simulations for the standard GI/M/s multiserver queueing model, emphasizing the case of large s. We obtain analytical results for the conditional distribution of the delay given the observed HOL delay. An approximation to its mean value serves as a refined estimator. For all three candidate delay estimators, the MSE relative to the square of the mean is asymptotically negligible in the many-server and classical heavy-traffic (HT) limiting regimes.

J	Hu, B; Benjaafar, S				Hu, Bin; Benjaafar, Saif			Partitioning of Servers in Queueing Systems During Rush Hour	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						server partitioning; multiserver queueing systems; multiple demand classes; rush hour demand	EFFICIENCY; QUEUES	This paper is motivated by two phenomena observed in many queueing systems in practice. The first is the partitioning of server capacity among different customers based on their service time requirements. The second is rush hour demand where a large number of customers arrive over a short period of time followed by few or no arrivals for an extended period thereafter. We study a system with multiple parallel servers and multiple customer classes. The servers can be partitioned into server groups, each dedicated to a single customer class. The system operates under a rush hour regime with a large number of customers arriving at the beginning of the rush hour period. We show that this allows us to reduce the problem to one that is deterministic and for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We compare the performance of the system with and without server partitioning during rush hour and address three basic questions. (1) Is partitioning beneficial to the system? (2) Is it equally beneficial to all customer classes? (3) If it is implemented, what is an optimal partition? We evaluate the applicability of our results to systems where customers arrive over time using (1) deterministic fluid models and (2) simulation models for systems with stochastic interarrival times.

Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that whereas psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved. We further investigate direct and indirect antecedents of psychological safety. This research offers insights into actions that managers can take to enhance psychological safety and, consequently, motivate their employees to share knowledge.

J	Li, CH; Debo, LG				Li, Cuihong; Debo, Laurens G.			Second Sourcing vs. Sole Sourcing with Capacity Investment and Asymmetric Information	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sourcing; auction; supplier relationship; supply chain management	PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS; COMPETITION; COSTS; STRATEGIES; SUPPLIERS; AUCTIONS; DESIGN	We study the decision of a manufacturer ( the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole- sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier ( the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier ( the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer to take advantage of alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer is referred to as the option value of second sourcing. On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future pro. tin second sourcing induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in second sourcing than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of second sourcing. The overall benefit of second sourcing relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value of second sourcing is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus second sourcing is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high ( under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that second sourcing is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that second sourcing may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity.

J	Gopal, A; Gao, GD				Gopal, Anandasivam; Gao, Guodong (Gordon)			Certification in the Indian Offshore IT Services Industry	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						certification; signaling; outsourcing; quality management; OM-information technology interface; technology management; process design; service operations	ISO-9000 CERTIFICATION; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; QUALITY MANAGEMENT; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; FIRMS; TQM; PERSPECTIVE; IMPROVEMENT; DIFFUSION	Third-party process certification programs such as the ISO 9001 and capability maturity model (CMM) have been widely adopted in recent years. In this study we employ three competing theoretical frameworks signaling, efficiency gains, and institutional theory-to analyze the motivations for a firm to acquire quality certification and the performance implications thereafter. We test these hypotheses in the context of CMM certification based on data from the Indian offshore IT services industry between 1997 and 2002. Our results indicate that more cost-effective firms and export-oriented firms are more likely to seek out and acquire certification. In addition, CMM-certified firms show significant improvements in exports, but not on the firm's cost structure. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CMM certification helps indicate firm capabilities to potential customers and thus appear to be most consistent with signaling explanations of certification rather than the efficiency gains or institutional theories.

J	Song, JS; Zhao, Y				Song, Jing-Sheng; Zhao, Yao			The Value of Component Commonality in a Dynamic Inventory System with Lead Times	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						component commonality; dynamic model; lead times; allocation rules; assemble-to-order systems	TO-ORDER SYSTEMS; PRODUCT VARIETY; SERVICE LEVEL; SUPPLY-CHAIN; SAFETY STOCK; FILL RATE; PERFORMANCE; MULTIITEM; DEMAND; DIFFERENTIATION	Component commonality has been widely recognized as a key factor in achieving product variety at low cost. Yet the theory on the value of component commonality is rather limited in the inventory literature. The existing results were built primarily on single-period models or periodic-review models with zero lead times. In this paper, we consider a continuous-review system with positive lead times. We find that although component commonality is in general beneficial, its value depends strongly on component costs, lead times, and dynamic allocation rules. Under certain conditions, several previous findings based on static models do not hold. In particular, component commonality does not always generate inventory benefits under certain commonly used allocation rules. We provide insight on when component commonality generates inventory benefits and when it may not. We further establish some asymptotic properties that connect component lead times and costs to the impact of component commonality. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate the value of commonality and its sensitivity to various system parameters in between the asymptotic limits. In addition, we show how to evaluate the system under a new allocation rule, a modified version of the standard first-in-first-out rule.

Demand-Supply Mismatches and Stock Market Reaction: Evidence from Excess Inventory Announcements	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						empirical research; excess inventory; stock price performance; supply chain management	FIRM; CHAIN; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCT; PRICES; EVENT; COSTS; RISK	This paper documents that excess inventory announcements, an indication of demand-supply mismatch, are associated with an economically and statistically significant negative stock market reaction. The results are based on a sample of 276 excess inventory announcements made during 1990-2002. Over a two-day period (the day of the announcement and the day before the announcement) the mean ( median) stock market reaction ranges from -6.79% to -6.93% (-4.51% to -4.79%), depending on the benchmark used to estimate the market reaction. The percent of sample firms that experience negative market reaction ranges from 73% to 74%. When excess inventory is at the announcing firm's customers, the market reaction is more negative than when the excess inventory is at the announcing firm. The stock market reaction is less negative for excess inventory announcements made by larger firms but is more negative for firms with higher growth prospects and with higher debt-equity ratios.

Lawrence			Division of Labor in Medical Office Practices	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						healthcare management; service operations; survey research; econometric analysis	SURVIVOR ANALYSIS; SERVICES; SCALE; MODEL	This paper examines the staffing, division of labor, and resulting profitability of primary care physician practices. Division of labor is viewed as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of production processes through specialization. At the same time, division of labor also introduces coordination cost as handoffs and communication needs increase. We attempt to empirically assess the net effect in primary care physician offices. We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types. We find evidence supporting both hypotheses. We conclude that many physicians are gaining little financial benefit from delegating work to support staff. This suggests that small practices with few staff may be viable alternatives to traditional practice designs.

Demands in consecutive periods are independent and influenced by prices charged in each period. In particular, we treat price as a decision variable to maximize the total discounted profit. We analyze the optimal solution-structure of a two-period lifetime problem and from insights gained in numerical experiments, develop a base-stock/list-price heuristic policy for products with arbitrary fixed lifetimes. Experiments show this policy to be effective.

J	Tomlin, B				Tomlin, Brian			Impact of Supply Learning When Suppliers Are Unreliable	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply uncertainty; dual sourcing; inventory	INVENTORY PROBLEM; YIELD RANDOMNESS; LOST SALES; DEMAND; DIVERSIFICATION; MODELS; COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; CHAINS	Dual sourcing and inventory are two prevalent and widely studied strategies firms use to manage yield risk. A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of "supply learning" (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model.

J	Dawande, M; Pinedo, M; Sriskandarajah, C				Dawande, Milind; Pinedo, Michael; Sriskandarajah, Chelliah			Multiple Part-Type Production in Robotic Cells: Equivalence of Two Real-World Models	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						robotic cells; cyclic production; dual-gripper cells; output buffers; computational complexity	CLUSTER TOOL PERFORMANCE; TRAVELING SALESMAN; PARALLEL MACHINES; SINGLE-HOIST; UNIT CYCLES; GRIPPER; THROUGHPUT; TIME; ALGORITHMS; LINES	We address the scheduling of operations in a robotic cell that produces multiple part-types. The objective is to obtain a cyclic schedule-a sequence of robot moves and an ordering of the parts-that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or, equivalently, maximizes the throughput. We consider two different models that are currently used in practice. The first is a single-gripper cell with a unit-capacity output buffer at each machine. The second is a bufferless dual-gripper cell. We focus our analysis on a widely used class of cyclic solutions, referred to as CRM cycles. The main outcome of our analysis is the equivalence of the two models (i.e., the maximum throughput is the same for both models) under conditions that are common in practice. The equivalence is established in two steps: (i) identification of a subset of dominating cyclic solutions for each model, and (ii) provision of a one-to-one mapping between these dominating cycles such that corresponding cycles have the same throughput. We also analyze the computational complexity of the throughput maximization problem for the two models. The enhanced capabilities (i. e., output buffers and dual gripper) of both models were motivated by a need to improve the throughput. However, the costs of acquiring these capabilities differ significantly. Our discussions with operations managers at a Dallas-area robotic cell manufacturer revealed that the total cost of designing and programming the robot's control mechanism for a cell with output buffers is about 20% less than that for a dual-gripper cell. The equivalence of the two models is, therefore, somewhat surprising and has significant practical implications. For cells that operationalize CRM cycles, the use of output buffers instead of a dual gripper can result in considerable savings without compromising throughput.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-c mu (Gc mu) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.

Canan			Incentives for Quality Through Endogenous Routing	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						queueing networks; routing; Nash equilibrium; quality control; piece rate; epsilon equilibrium	SERVICE; COMPETITION; CONTRACTS; SYSTEMS; PRODUCTIVITY; INFORMATION; QUEUES	We study how rework routing together with wage and piece-rate compensation can strengthen incentives for quality. Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.

First, it identifies configurations of ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies. Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.

J	Chen, YJ; Vulcano, G				Chen, Ying-Ju; Vulcano, Gustavo			Effects of Information Disclosure Under First- and Second-Price Auctions in a Supply Chain Setting	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain; auctions; information asymmetry; demand effort; interdependent values	COORDINATION; CONTRACTS; RESALE; MARKET; PROCUREMENT; MANAGEMENT	We study a supply chain where an upstream supplier auctions his inventory or capacity as a bundle. The importance of this setting is twofold: From a practical point of view, there are several examples, both in manufacturing (e. g., auctioning the capacity of a wafer fabrication facility) and service industries (e. g., auctioning the sponsorship of a website), where a supplier's capacity is sold as a single piece; from a theoretical side, it highlights the information asymmetry introduced on the downstream supply chain parties when the auction result is disclosed. We formulate the problem as a two-stage supply chain comprising a single supplier and two resellers. Each reseller receives a signal of the consumer demand and bids for the capacity of the supplier. The supplier announces the winner as well as the auction price. Both resellers can get additional units in a procurement market and then engage in Cournot competition in the consumer market. We analyze the impact of the information elicited by the supplier in the early stage of the game. We characterize sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium behavior, derive the equilibrium bidding functions under both first -and second-price auctions, and show that the bidding functions are lower than the corresponding ones for a single-shot auction without resale. Our computational experiments indicate that both the supplier and resellers are better off running a second-price auction and that consumers benefit if the resellers have very different signals on the total demand. Overall, our results suggest that traditional auctions may have a profound impact in the context of a supply chain because of the information disclosure in the upstream stages.

Within a multinomial logit model of consumer choice over substitutes, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming formulation and derive the optimal dynamic pricing policy. We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season. Based on the above insights, we propose a computationally efficient approach to the initial inventory decision, which delivers close-to-optimal inventory levels for all testing cases.

Benefits of Reevaluating Real-Time Order Fulfillment Decisions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						online retailing; online order fulfillment; local search heuristics	NETWORK DESIGN; E-BUSINESS; MODELS	When a customer orders online, an online retailer assigns the order to one or more of its warehouses and/or drop-shippers to minimize procurement and transportation costs based on the available current information. However, this assignment is necessarily myopic because it cannot account for any subsequent customer orders or future inventory replenishment. We examine the benefits of periodically reevaluating these real-time assignments. We construct near-optimal heuristics for the reassignment for a large set of customer orders to minimize the total number of shipments. Finally, we present evidence of significant saving opportunities by testing the heuristics on order data from a major online retailer.

Optimal Backlogging Over an Infinite Horizon Under Time-Varying Convex Production and Inventory Costs	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						minimum forecast horizons; convex network flow; production planning	LOT-SIZE MODEL; PLANNING-HORIZONS; FORECAST HORIZONS; DETERMINISTIC DEMANDS; OPTIMIZATION; EXTENSIONS; EXISTENCE; THEOREM	We consider an infinite horizon production planning problem with nonstationary, convex production and inventory costs. Backlogging is allowed, unlike as in related previous work, and inventory cost is interpreted as backlogging cost when inventory is negative. We create finite horizon truncations of the infinite horizon problem and employ classic results on convex production planning to derive a closed-form formula for the minimum forecast horizon. We show that optimal production levels are monotonically increasing in the length of horizon, leading to solution convergence and a rolling horizon procedure for delivering an infinite horizon optimal production plan. The minimum forecast horizon formula is employed to illustrate how cost parameters affect how far one must look into the future to make an infinite horizon optimal decision today.
