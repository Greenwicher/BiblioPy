J	Naveh, E; Marcus, A				Naveh, E; Marcus, A			Achieving competitive advantage through implementing a replicable management standard: Installing and using ISO 9000	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						ISO 9000 standard; operating and business performance; usage; installation	TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; PRODUCT INNOVATION; EMPIRICAL POWER; TEST STATISTICS; PERFORMANCE; ADOPTION; PERSPECTIVE; DIFFUSION; SPECIFICATION; CERTIFICATION	This paper investigates the effects of implementing the international standard ISO 9000 on measures of business and operating performance. Based on the literature and a case study we identified two stages in implementing ISO 9000-(1) Installation, which has two dimensions: (a) external coordination and (b) integration; and (2) Usage, which also has two dimensions: (a) in daily practice and (b) as a catalyst for change. The hypotheses were that installation of ISO 9000 is positively related to use of ISO 9000, and use of ISO 9000 is positively related to operating performance. In addition, use of ISO 9000 is positively related to business performance since operating performance is positively related to business performance. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) to test our hypotheses and validated the results by comparing the longitudinal perfomance of ISO 9000 certified companies with four matched samples of companies that were not ISO 9000 certified. Our analysis indicated that while the installation stage was necessary to successfully implement ISO 9000, organizations achieved a distinct operating advantage from this replicable standard when they used it in daily practice and as a catalyst for change. These findings were based on responses to a survey of 1150 quality managers in 924 organizations, which was supplemented for about one-third of the organizations with longitudinal information from the Compustat database on the organizations' business and operating performance. The validation indicated that implementing the ISO 9000 standard led to improved operating performance, but that this outcome did not necessarily or automatically yield better business performance.

J	Wu, ZH; Choi, TY				Wu, ZH; Choi, TY			Supplier-supplier relationships in the buyer-supplier triad: Building theories from eight case studies	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supplier-supplier relationships; buyer-supplier relationships; supply chain management; archetypes; operations strategy; case studies	JAPANESE PRODUCT-DEVELOPMENT; AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; ALLIANCES; NETWORKS; CONFIGURATIONS; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; STRATEGY; PLANTS; HONDA	Many researchers have studied how the buying company manages its relationship with suppliers (i.e. buyer-supplier relationship). Extending this genre of study, researchers have recently shown interest in investigating how the buying company manages relationships between the suppliers (i.e. supplier-supplier relationship). In other words, just as the relationship with the suppliers does, the relationships between suppliers have strategic implications for the buyer. We present in this study eight cases that describe supplier-supplier relationship dynamics. Using theory building through case studies, we identify five archetypes of supplier-supplier relationships. Each type of relationship is a unique configuration of the relational characteristics. We also present working propositions that associate the antecedent conditions that lead to these archetypes and eventual performance implications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tsikriktsis, N				Tsikriktsis, N			A review of techniques for treating missing data in OM survey research	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review						missing data; empirical research; measurement and methodology	INCOMPLETE DATA; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; REGRESSION; VALUES; MODEL	The treatment of missing data has been overlooked by the OM literature, while other fields such as marketing, organizational behavior, economics, statistics and psychometrics have paid more attention to the issue. A review of 103 survey-based articles published in the Journal of Operations Management between 1993 and 2001 shows that listwise deletion, which is often the least accurate technique of dealing with missing data, is heavily utilized by OM researchers. The paper also discusses the research implications of missing data, types of missing data and concludes with recommendations on which techniques should be used under different circumstances in order to improve the treatment of missing data in OM survey research.

J	Hong, P; Vonderembse, MA; Doll, WJ; Nahm, AY				Hong, P; Vonderembse, MA; Doll, WJ; Nahm, AY			Role change of design engineers in product development	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						role change; design engineers; marketing/manufacturing interface; measurement/methodology; product development; teams	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS; MARKET ORIENTATION; SHARED KNOWLEDGE; SUCCESS FACTORS; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; WORK; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Product development is recognized as cross-functional, knowledge-intensive work that has become increasingly important in the fast-paced, globally competitive environment. Researchers and practicing managers contend that design engineers may play an important role in product development efforts. However, their effect on the product development process is not well understood and the extent of their impact on product development performance has not been adequately accessed. This research defines the changing role of design engineers, and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge about customers. The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of design engineers, clarity of project targets, shared knowledge about customers and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of design engineers expands the clarity of project targets increase. This increase impacts the extent of shared knowledge about customers. Increases in the clarity of project targets and shared knowledge about customers appear to enhance product development productivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Funda, SA; Robinson, EP				Funda, SA; Robinson, EP			Information sharing and coordination in make-to-order supply chains	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; information technology; batch manufacturing; inventory management; lot sizing; industrial dynamics	LOT-SIZING PROBLEM; DYNAMIC DEMAND; MRP SYSTEMS; REPLENISHMENT; INVENTORIES; POLICIES; MODEL	This research, based on our observations of an industrial vendor-manufacturer relationship, investigates the impact of information sharing and physical flow coordination in a make-to-order supply chain. We mathematically model and develop simulation-based rolling schedule procedures for analyzing the manufacturer's ordering policies, transportation activities, and the vendor's manufacturing and order fulfillment processes under five alternative integration strategies. Our objective is to measure the value of information sharing and system coordination across the strategies, identify whether the source of the benefits come from information sharing or coordination, study the allocation of system benefits among channel members, and analyze the impact of environmental factors on system cost performance. The experimental results indicate a 47.58% cost reduction moving from a traditional supply chain to a fully integrated system. While information sharing reduces costs, the main economic benefit comes from coordinated decision-making. The savings associated with system integration are not equally allocated among channel members, and vary by strategy. The procedures developed in the research provide economic insight that fosters the sharing of technological and strategic efforts. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kimes, SE; Thompson, GA				Kimes, SE; Thompson, GA			An evaluation of heuristic methods for determining the best table mix in full-service restaurants	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						yield management; capacity management; service operations; simulation	REVENUE MANAGEMENT; YIELD MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY; MODEL	Little research has been done on the optimal mix of supply in service businesses that maximizes revenue. Our research context is the full-service restaurant table mix problem. This problem, which is quite new to the literature, finds the optimal number of different size tables for a restaurant to maximize its value (revenue or contribution) generating potential. Specifically, we examine the effectiveness of eight heuristic techniques for the problem using two experiments. The first experiment uses data from a 240-seat full-service restaurant to evaluate all eight heuristics, while the second experiment investigates the performance of selected heuristics under a broader set of environmental factors. The results of our first experiment showed that the better of the simulated annealing heuristic variants yielded the optimal solution in seven of eight test problems, averaging within 0.1% of optimal. Our second experiment showed that the simplest of the models we investigated yielded solutions within 1% of the simulated annealing solution. Finally, we observed that altering the table mix on a daily basis increased performance by over 1% compared to maintaining the optimal weekly table mix. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effective supply chain management (SCM) has become a potentially valuable way of securing competitive advantage and improving organizational performance. This research conceptualizes, develops, and validates six dimensions of SCM practices (strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, information sharing, information quality, internal lean practices, and postponement). Data for the study were collected from 196 organizations and the measurement scales were tested and validated using structural equation modeling. It is hoped that this study will provide a parsimonious measurement instrument to assess the performance of the overall supply chain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Boyer, KK; Hult, GTA				Boyer, KK; Hult, GTA			Extending the supply chain: Integrating operations and marketing in the online grocery industry	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service management; e-Services; marketing/operations integration; grocery industry; international business	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; SERVICE QUALITY; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; FIT INDEXES; TECHNOLOGIES; MANAGEMENT; ILLUSTRATION; METHODOLOGY; ORIENTATION; ACCEPTANCE	This study reports results from case studies of four Internet-ordering and home-delivery grocers and 2440 of their customers. Each grocer follows a different operations strategy as determined by choice of where to fulfill customer orders (from existing stores or from a dedicated DC) and by choice of delivery method (direct to the customer's home/office or indirect via customer pickup or third-party logistics provider). The survey data from customers are used to assess the degree of integration between marketing and operations and the relationship with customer behavioral intentions. The results indicate that eBusiness-, product-, and service-quality, all have a significant direct effect on customer behavioral intentions to purchase again. There is limited support for technology as a moderating factor. Finally, the relationships between the predictor variables and customer behavioral intentions differ across grocers. This supports the idea that grocers utilizing different operational strategies should focus attention on different facets of their business and provides insight as to where efforts should be directed.

J	da Silveira, GJC				da Silveira, GJC			Market priorities, manufacturing configuration, and business performance: An empirical analysis of the order-winners framework	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						manufacturing strategy; marketing/operations interface; surveys; regression analysis	PRODUCTION COMPETENCE; COMPETITIVE PRIORITIES; STRATEGY; FIT; ILLUSTRATION; METHODOLOGY; ENVIRONMENT; INDUSTRY; MODEL; TIME	This study carries out an empirical test of the order-winners framework in manufacturing organizations. Hill [Hill, T., 1985. Manufacturing Strategy: The Strategic Management of the Manufacturing Function, first ed. Macmillan, Basingstoke; Hill, T., 2000. Manufacturing Strategy: Text and Cases, second ed. Palgrave, Basingstoke] proposed the order-winners framework to help managers to improve understanding about markets and to develop a consistent manufacturing strategy. The framework defines ideal profiles of products and markets, and manufacturing and investment decisions that relate to alternative process choices. The study tests the hypothesis of a negative relationship between misfit to an ideal profile defined in the framework and business performance in domestic market share, return on sales, and return on investment in a survey of 183 manufacturers from 17 countries. Results found a significant negative relationship between misfit and domestic market share. The study contributes to operations management research by developing a methodology to measure fit as profile deviation in the context of manufacturing, and applying this methodology to the order-winners framework.

The growing number of articles on BOSC in the literature is an indication of the importance of the strategy and of its role in improving the competitiveness of an organization. The objective of a BOSC strategy is to meet the requirements of individual customers by leveraging the advantages of outsourcing and information technology. There are not many research articles that provide an overview of BOSC, despite the fact that this strategy is being promoted as the operations paradigm of the future. The main objective of this research is to (i) review the concepts of BOSC, (ii) develop definitions of BOSC, (iii) classify the literature based on a suitable classification scheme, leading to some useful insights into BOSC and some future research directions, (iv) review the selected articles on BOSC for their contribution to the development and operations of BOSC, (v) develop a framework for BOSC, and (vi) suggest some future research directions. The literature has been reviewed based on the following four major areas of decision-making: organizational competitiveness, the development and implementation of BOSC, the operations of BOSC, and information technology in BOSC. Some of the important observations are: (a) there is a lack of adequate research on the design and control of BOSC, (b) there is a need for further research on the implementation of BOSC, (c) human resource issues in BOSC have been ignored, (d) issues of product commonality and modularity from the perspective of partnership or supplier development require further attention and (e) the trade-off between responsiveness and the cost of logistics needs further study. The paper ends with concluding remarks. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Krajewski, L; Wei, JC; Tang, LL				Krajewski, L; Wei, JC; Tang, LL			Responding to schedule changes in build-to-order supply chains	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; case studies; master production scheduling	MANUFACTURING FLEXIBILITY; PRODUCT VARIETY; POWER; INFORMATION; CHANNELS; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; POSTPONEMENT; DIRECTIONS; COMMITMENT	This multiple case study explores the reaction strategies suppliers use to respond to short-term dynamics of schedule changes in build-to-order supply chains. We examine the relationship and supply chain processes between a notebook computer manufacturer and five component suppliers. Two distinct reaction strategies emerge from these five buyer-supplier dyads. The "reduce uncertainty" strategy emphasizes supply contracts with a high degree of restrictiveness, relatively infrequent schedule revisions, and a high level of form postponement. The "cope with uncertainty" strategy emphasizes flexible supply contracts, relatively frequent schedule revisions, and low levels of form postponement. Eight propositions are formulated to understand the linkage between a supplier's power, its short-term process flexibility, and the elements of its reaction strategy. The paper concludes by proposing future research directions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Christensen, WJ; Germain, R; Birou, L				Christensen, WJ; Germain, R; Birou, L			Build-to-order and just-in-time as predictors of applied supply chain knowledge and market performance	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BOSC; JIT; BTO; supply chain knowledge; market performance	ORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE; STRATEGY	The research increases our understanding of a build-to-order supply chain (BOSC) by examining the effects of two distinct yet related strategies on applied supply chain knowledge and market performance: a build-to-order (BTO) and a just-in-time (JIT) strategy. The results show that a BTO strategy positively affects market performance through its influence on the application of supply chain knowledge downstream with customers. Although a JIT strategy does affect the upstream application of knowledge with suppliers, the latter does not predict market performance. Theoretical and managerial implications are presented.

J	Weng, ZK; Parlar, M				Weng, ZK; Parlar, M			Managing build-to-order short life-cycle products: benefits of pre-season price incentives with standardization	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						price-incentive announcement; build-to-order products; standardized products	EARLY SALES; DECISIONS; STOCK; MODEL	In this paper we consider a firm that can produce standardized products (SP) or customized build-to-order products (BOP) with short life-cycles. We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to study the effect of offering price incentives to those customers who are willing to commit themselves to purchasing the cheaper-to-produce standardized product. The market's reaction to price incentives is captured by modeling the probabilistic behavior of two exclusive groups of customers who may be "price-sensitive" or "price-insensitive" and who are willing to commit themselves. We develop an analytic expression for the distribution of the demand for the BOP conditional on the actual number of committed demands for SP following the price-incentive announcement. We show that price incentives expand the total expected demand while reducing demand uncertainty and we present conditions under which it is optimal to offer a price incentive. Sequentially made price incentive and capacity decisions for the BOP that maximize expected profit are obtained by solving the dynamic programming problem. We provide a comparative statics analysis and examine the effect of varying parameter values on the optimal price-incentive discount rate. We also describe a numerical study and present a sensitivity analysis of the profit improvement obtained after offering price incentives. We show that for low purchase probability, large number of customers in the price-sensitive group and high profit margin price incentives can substantially improve the expected profit.

J	Mukhopadhyay, SK; Setoputro, R				Mukhopadhyay, SK; Setoputro, R			Optimal return policy and modular design for build-to-order products	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						reverse logistics; modular design; build-to-order; return policy	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; VARIETY	A build-to-order product gives the firm the opportunity to customize the product to the requirement of the customers. The firm will see an increase in demand, but face some operational difficulties. One of these is related to the return policy which is now a recognized tool to win customer orders. This is even more true for increasingly popular Internet sales where the opportunity to physically examine the product is absent. A tremendous advantage can be gained by the Internet firm if it could offer a return policy for BTO products. We propose the use of modularity in the product design as a solution to this problem. From manufacturer's point of view, following a policy of modularization and offering a generous return policy would increase revenue, but also increase the cost due to increased likelihood of return and increased cost of design. We develop a profit maximization model to jointly obtain optimal polices for return policy and modularity level in terms of certain market reaction parameters. We obtain a number of managerial guidelines for using marketing and operational strategy variables to influence those reaction parameters so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the market.

J	Holweg, M; Disney, SA; Hines, P; Naim, MM				Holweg, M; Disney, SA; Hines, P; Naim, MM			Towards responsive vehicle supply: a simulation-based investigation into automotive scheduling systems	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						build-to-order; scheduling; Taguchi method; systems modeling	CHAIN; ORDER; METHODOLOGY; STRATEGIES	Vehicle supply has traditionally been based on forecast-driven production, and a large fraction of cars has been sold from stock-a practice which incurs considerable cost in terms of stock holding and sales incentives. Derived from successes in other industries, the benefits of responsive supply systems capable of providing customized vehicles in short lead-times have been pointed out. While the theoretical discussion of such 'build-to-order' (BTO) strategies is well advanced, the dynamic feasibility of implementing these concepts is far from understood. Using a simulation of a multi-tier supply chain-system, this paper investigates the impact of altering key aspects of the scheduling activities with the objective of determining the scope for potential improvements in responsiveness of the supply chain. The simulation results show that current vehicle supply systems are not capable of supporting BTO due to insufficient feedback between supply and demand, as well as due to the strong reliance on forecasting in the scheduling process. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how to improve current scheduling systems towards increasing the content of vehicles built to customer order. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cao, Q; Dowlatshahi, S				Cao, Q; Dowlatshahi, S			The impact of alignment between virtual enterprise and information technology on business performance in an agile manufacturing environment	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agile manufacturing; virtual enterprise; information technology; business performance	OF-FIT INDEXES; STRATEGIC ORIENTATION; OPERATIONS STRATEGY; ACHIEVING AGILITY; FLEXIBILITY; ORGANIZATIONS; METHODOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; COUNTRIES	Manufacturing companies are facing rapid and unanticipated changes in their business environment. Agile manufacturing (AM) is a manufacturing paradigm that focuses on smaller scale, modular production facilities, and agile operations capable of dealing with turbulent and changing environments. From several enablers of AM, virtual enterprise (VE) and information technology (IT) were chosen. This empirical study explored the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance in an AM setting. Extensive data collection strategy and several tests are used to establish the reliability and validity of the data collected. Extensive analyses of the data using structural equation molding were performed for five hypotheses. The results indicate that both VE and IT had positive influences on business performance. It was also established that the alignment between VE and IT had a positive impact on business performance. Further, it was shown that the impact of the alignment between VE and IT on business performance was more significant than the impact of VE and IT on business performance individually. In conclusion, the assessment of the results along with future research directions is provided. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Prasad, S; Tata, J; Madan, M				Prasad, S; Tata, J; Madan, M			Build to order supply chains in developed and developing countries	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article							MASS CUSTOMIZATION	The new competitive environment requires firms to produce products with greater specificity to customer needs. Traditional approaches historically employed by manufacturers, such as the use of planning bills and standard interactions among suppliers and buyers, may not prove to be as effective in this new environment. In our research, we first seek to differentiate the traditional Made to Stock (MTS) environment from the emerging Build to Order (BTO) one. In addition, given the global nature of supply chains today, we also compare BTO operations in developed countries with those in the developing world. The results from this study can be useful to practicing managers because we provide specific directions on aligning supply chains for the BTO environment across the globe. In addition, this research adds to the theoretical development of postponement strategies in manufacturing, and establishes empirical links between the international operations, build to order environment, and supply chain literatures.

J	Rungtusanatham, M; Forza, C				Rungtusanatham, M; Forza, C			Coordinating product design, and supply chain design process design, decisions - Part A: Topic motivation, performance implications, and article review process	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						3-DCE; product-process-supply chain design; design coordination	MANAGEMENT; INVOLVEMENT; STRATEGIES; INDUSTRY; MARKET; US	Despite the undeniable appeal and importance of coordinating decisions across products design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design to both science and practice, we know very little about how to do so to maximize operational, supply chain, and firm performance. This special issue on Coordinating Product Design, Process Design, and Supply Chain Design Decisions was conceived early 2003 to bring awareness to and to spur scholarly research into this topic. In doing so, we cast a wide net from both content and methodological perspectives, encouraging interdisciplinary papers that were theory-building and/or theory-testing in purpose using either empirical-based (e.g., case research, survey research, historical research, etc.) and/or modeling (i.e., optimization or simulation) methodologies. The resulting seven papers represent the fruits of this harvest and are being presented in two consecutive parts. Whereas Part A introduces the three papers that speak to the performance implications of coordinating product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design decisions, Part B introduces the remaining four papers that address how and why these three decision areas can be coordinated. Included in Part A of this special issue, we also make the review process transparent for third-party evaluation and, more importantly, formally recognize and thank the numerous colleagues from across multiple disciplines and academic institutions around the world for their efforts in helping us produce this two-part special issue.

J	Huang, GQ; Zhang, XY; Liang, L				Huang, GQ; Zhang, XY; Liang, L			Towards integrated optimal configuration of platform products, manufacturing processes, and supply chains	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						platform product development; supply chain configuration; commonality; modularity; genetic algorithm	COMPONENT COMMONALITY; SAFETY STOCK; VARIETY; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; FAMILY; MODEL	This paper seeks to address the challenge of designing effective supply chain systems that integrate platform product decisions, manufacturing process decisions, and supply sourcing decisions. Specifically, this paper considers the specific scenario of optimizing the configuration of the supply chain system given commonality among platform products. The paper uses and extends the concept of Generic Bills of Materials (GBOM) of a product family as a unified framework for qualitatively capturing and representing the structure of its supply chain. This qualitative model is then enhanced by a mathematical model developed to quantify the relationships among various design decisions. Endeavoring to solve the mathematical model more efficiently, we propose an effective heuristic method using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Although GA generally does not guarantee the optimal solution, the best heuristic solutions obtained in this study are consistent with the optimal solutions obtained using Dynamic Programming. The resulting mathematical model and solution algorithm are then used to investigate the mutual impact between the design decisions of platform products and of processes in the supply chain through sensitivity analyses. Several useful managerial insights are generated and discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Thirumalai, S; Sinha, KK				Thirumalai, S; Sinha, KK			Customer satisfaction with order fulfillment in retail supply chains: implications of product type in electronic B2C transactions	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						order fulfillment; retail supply chain; electronic B2C commerce; customer satisfaction	PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION SERVICE; CONSUMER SATISFACTION; QUALITY; EXPECTATIONS; DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; CONVENIENCE; LOGISTICS; MODELS	This paper focuses on the proverbial "last mile" of the retail supply chain - i.e., delivering products to the end-customer and highlights the need for recognizing product type differences in configuring order fulfillment processes in electronic business-to-customer (B2C) transactions. The following two questions serve as the motivation for the study: Do customer expectations of order fulfillment processes vary across product types? Should the product type matter in configuring order fulfillment processes? From the studies in the marketing literature, we infer that customer satisfaction assessments are based on customer expectations of order fulfillment processes, and that these expectations systematically vary across the three product types: convenience goods (e.g., groceries, home and office supplies), shopping goods (e.g., ready-to-wear men, women, and kids' apparel), and specialty goods (e.g., desktop and notebook computers, and wedding dresses). In particular, we posit that ceteris paribus, customer satisfaction with order fulfillment will decrease moving along a continuum of product types, from convenience goods to specialty goods. The empirical analysis for this study is based on data collected on dimensions of customer satisfaction with order fulfillment from a sample of 256 firms engaged in electronic B2C transactions. Firms included in our study sample are such that their products can be classified into only one of three product types: convenience, shopping, or specialty goods. In essence, each firm in the study sample is a proxy for one of three product types. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that, on average, customers tend to have higher satisfaction levels with the order fulfillment process of convenience and shopping goods than with the order fulfillment process of specialty goods. We discuss the managerial implications of our results, contributions of the paper to the literature, limitations, and directions for future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Su, JCP; Chang, YL; Ferguson, M				Su, JCP; Chang, YL; Ferguson, M			Evaluation of postponement structures to accommodate mass customization	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; operations strategy; mass customization; postponement	HEWLETT-PACKARD	In order to meet increasing customer demands for more diverse product offerings, firms are revising their supply chain structures to accommodate mass customization. The revised structures often involve delaying the delivery of the products until after the customer orders arrive, termed time postponement (TP), or delaying the differentiation of the products until later production stages, termed form postponement (FP). We develop models representing possible implementations of the TP and FP structures and compare their performance in total supply chain cost and expected customer waiting times. We find that once the number of different products increases above some threshold level, the TP structure is preferred under both performance metrics. For the most general model, a numerical experiment was designed to investigate how different factors affect the performance of the TP and FP structures. Through this experiment we show that higher arrival time and process time variations make the FP structure more favorable while increases in the number of products and higher interest rates make the TP structure more favorable. We also offer guidance to managers using either structure on where to allocate resources for performance improvement. For example, to improve the customer waiting times under the FP structure, increasing the coverage of the generic component and reducing the number of products provide larger benefits than reducing the variability of the arrival and process times.

Coordinating approaches, tradeoffs, and future research directions	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						3-DCE; "product-manufacturing process-supply chain system design"; design coordination	ORGANIZATIONAL-CHANGE; STRUCTURAL INERTIA	Complementing Part A which appeared in an earlier issue, Coordinating product design, process design, and supply chain design decisions. Part B. coordinating approaches, tradeoffs, and future research directions introduces four additional papers that belong to this special issue. These four papers seek to provide answers to the following two questions: "What mechanisms allow product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design decisions to be coordinated?" and "Why should decisions with respect to product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design be coordinated?" Each of the four papers compiled in Part B provides, foremost, an approach to coordinate decisions across the domains of product design, manufacturing process design, and supply chain design. The proposed coordinating mechanisms range from a network-based modeling approach to an assessment procedure for evaluating product architectures to the integration of relevant suppliers into the new product development (NPD) process to a goal programming modeling approach. The fourth paper in Part B, in fact, deploys the proposed goal programming modeling approach to identify and formalize the potential tradeoffs among decisions across the three domains. Part B completes the special issue by identifying future research opportunities, beyond those highlighted within the seven papers that form Part A and Part B of this special issue on Coordinating product design, process design, and supply chain design decisions.

J	Blackhurst, J; Wu, T; O'Grady, P				Blackhurst, J; Wu, T; O'Grady, P			PCDM: a decision support modeling methodology for supply chain, product and process design decisions	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain coordination; supply chain; product and process design decision modeling	PETRI NETS; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; INFORMATION; COORDINATION; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; FLOW	While there is considerable pressure to improve the operation of supply chains, their inherent complexity can make modeling a supply chain a difficult task. This difficulty is compounded when the need to model the effects of product and process design changes are also considered. Yet there could be considerable benefits in designing supply chains taking into account the operation of the supply chain as well as the design of the product and the design of the manufacturing processes used in the supply chain. This paper aims to address the central research issue of developing a methodology that can assist a manager in making decisions by modeling both the operation of a supply chain design and the effects of product and process design decisions. The proposed methodology, called Product Chain Decision Model (PCDM), is presented in this paper. This uses an abstracted network to model supply chain systems. Finally, an industry example of joint supply chain and product design is described to illustrate the application of PCDM. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fixson, SK				Fixson, SK			Product architecture assessment: a tool to link product, process, and supply chain design decisions	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product architecture; modularity; 3D-CE; product-process-supply chain design	MASS CUSTOMIZATION; MODULARITY; COMMONALITY; COST; FLEXIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; INNOVATION; TIME; INFORMATION; INDUSTRIES	Increasingly heterogeneous markets, together with shorter product life cycles, are forcing many companies to simultaneously compete in the three domains of product, process, and supply chain. Dependencies among decisions across these domains make this competitive situation very complex. To address this complexity, three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3D-CE) has been suggested ([Fine, C.H., 1998. Clockspeed-Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage. Perseus Books, Reading, MA.]). Applying 3D-CE requires an operationalization of one of its core elements: the product architecture. In this paper, I develop a multi-dimensional framework that enables comprehensive product architecture assessments. The framework builds on existing product characteristic concepts such as component commonality, product platforms, and product modularity. The framework's utility is illustrated with two example products, showing how individual product architecture dimensions link decisions across different domains. This framework can be used to focus advice for product design on product architecture dimensions that are critical for a given operational strategy, to assess advantages and limitations of operational strategies in conjunction with given product architectures, or to develop dynamic capabilities such as planning effective product-operation strategy combinations.

J	Petersen, KJ; Handfield, RB; Ragatz, GL				Petersen, KJ; Handfield, RB; Ragatz, GL			Supplier integration into new product development: coordinating product, process and supply chain design	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product development; supply management	SECTORAL DIFFERENCES; SUCCESS FACTORS; TECHNOLOGY; COOPERATION; PERSPECTIVE; INNOVATION; ALLIANCES; BUYER; MODEL; COLLABORATION	In many industries, firms are seeking to cut concept to customer development time, improve quality, reduce the cost of new products and facilitate the smooth launch of new products. Prior research has indicated that the integration of material suppliers into the new product development (NPD) cycle can provide substantial benefits towards achieving these goals. This involvement may range from simple consultation with suppliers on design ideas to making suppliers fully responsible for the design of components or systems they will supply. Moreover, suppliers may be involved at different stages of the new product development process. Early supplier involvement is a key coordinating process in supply chain design, product design and process design. Several important questions regarding supplier involvement in new product development remain unanswered. Specifically, we look at the issue of what managerial practices affect new product development team effectiveness when suppliers are to be involved. We also consider whether these factors differ depending on when the supplier is to be involved and what level of responsibility is to be given to the supplier. Finally, we examine whether supplier involvement in new product development can produce significant improvements in financial returns and/or product design performance. We test these proposed relationships using survey data collected from a group of global organizations and find support for the relationships based on the results of a multiple regression analysis.

The model enables straightforward representation of the interrelations among multiple objectives and analysis of tradeoffs among those that exhibit conflicts. The model is demonstrated through a discussion of integrality versus modularity in product and supply chain designs that is motivated by events that took place in the automotive industry over the last decade.

The reality is that the not-for-profit is a far more complex organization that is responsible to diverse groups of stakeholders. Unlike for-profit organizations, not-for-profit (NFP) organizations have to focus on dual, and often conflicting, goals relating to fulfilling their overall mission while also generating enough revenue to maintain their operating structures. In order to better understand the nature of the dual orientation of the NFP organization, the behavior of Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) patrons using the CSO website is viewed. Specifically, this study examines data for individuals purchasing CSO, concert tickets on-line during an 8-month period in 2000-2001. MANOVA and ANOVA statistical procedures are used to analyze the effects of both the economic and mission related orientations operationalized through the e-service encounter. Further, we view data from the online ticketing function relative to the labor costs of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wisner, PS; Stringfellow, A; Youngdahl, WE; Parker, L				Wisner, PS; Stringfellow, A; Youngdahl, WE; Parker, L			The service volunteer - loyalty chain: an exploratory study of charitable not-for-profit service organizations	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						volunteer service design; volunteer satisfaction; not-for-profit sustainability	CUSTOMER CONTACT; QUALITY; COMMITMENT	Many not-for-profit organizations rely on volunteers to help accomplish their service objectives. Although volunteers work alongside or in some cases replace employees in the delivery of service, incorporating volunteer labor into the service delivery system of the not-for-profit poses unique challenges. Understanding these challenges represents an important foundation building step in understanding the implications for service design and service operations when using volunteers. This paper identifies and describes service design and operational factors relevant to volunteer satisfaction in not-for-profit organizations. Using data collected from 288 volunteers working in 43 not-for-profit agencies, the study explores the elements of service delivery that impact volunteer satisfaction, and further tests the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and loyalty to the not-for-profit organization. Findings include that satisfied volunteers are more likely to remain for longer periods of time with the same organization, are more likely to donate financially to the not-for-profit, and are more likely to recommend the volunteer experience to others. Each of these outcomes helps to ensure the continued sustainability of the not-for-profit organization. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We consider a total of 169 branch offices of the agency located in 79 counties that process a variety of transactions and provide services including automobile registrations, issuance of driver licenses, recreational vehicle registration, and personal identification registry. The proposed methodology and decision support system incorporate a number of factors such as branch office efficiencies based on multiple measures, budget restrictions, capacity limitations for processing transactions, and demand requirements in designing an efficient service system. Our approach employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) models. A series of experiments are conducted with the proposed model by varying, the levels of system-wide efficiency, resource reallocation, and budget in generating a set of decisions that executive management of the agency can implement. In addition, we investigate service channel management issues that the agency is currently facing in providing the services by web, phone, facsimile, and mail in addition to branch offices. We discuss how the branch closures influence channel management decisions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper reports the result of an empirical study comparing application of service management principles in one public sector area, further education (FE) colleges, with private sector service organizations. Although within our sample marked differences exist between the levels of service drivers and outcomes, our findings suggest that the same management model is applicable to both sectors. Based on a sample of 291 service organizations, we demonstrate that a managerial model, represented by the service profit chain, is valid in both our FE college and private sector sample. Specifically, progressive human resource management practices led to employee satisfaction, which in turn impacted both service quality and customer satisfaction in both the public and private organizations. The results indicate that the performance of FE colleges arose in part from the managerial choices made in adoption of practices, and that it is lack of employee focus that may be holding back performance. Relevant to both public and private sectors is that the research indicates that human resource factors have a stronger impact than quality procedures, on both service quality and customer satisfaction.

J	Thompson, GM				Thompson, GM			Using information on unconstrained student demand to improve university course schedules	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						course scheduling; unconstrained demand; heuristics	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; TIMETABLING PROBLEM; SCHOOL; MODEL; IMPLEMENTATION; SATISFACTION	We examine how using information on unconstrained demand can improve operational decisions. Specifically, we examine the widespread problem of developing course schedules in not-for-profit university settings. We investigate the potential benefit of incorporating, into the scheduling process, information on the unconstrained demand of students for courses. Prior to this study, the status quo in our college, like that in a large proportion of university settings, was building the course schedule to avoid time conflicts between required courses and to minimize time conflicts between designated groups of courses, such as electives in a particular area. Compared to the status quo approach, we find that, based on three semester's worth of actual data, an approach that explicitly considers students' course preferences improves a student-based metric of schedule quality on the order of over 4% (which is the equivalent, in our setting, of improving service for over 20% of students).

J	Goldstein, SM; Naor, M				Goldstein, SM; Naor, M			Linking publicness to operations management practices: a study of quality management practices in hospitals	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations management practices; publicness dimensions; quality management; health care operations; empirical research methods; regression analysis	PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; TQM IMPLEMENTATION; BALDRIGE; CULTURE; VALIDATION; GOVERNMENT; STRATEGY; IMPACT	The goal of this study is to serve as a foundation to establish a link between the theory of organizational publicness and operations management practices. Quality management practices provide the unit of analysis for studying this linkage. The theory of organizational publicness is used to establish that organizations can be defined on a continuum of publicness rather than as purely public or purely private. Particular cultural factors, political influences, and organizational characteristics define this publicness. The study investigates the linkage between four publicness dimensions (ownership, goal setting, funding, and control) and operations-related quality practices (information and analysis, staff focus, and process management) in U.S. hospitals. The results of regression analysis show that the publicness dimensions of ownership and control are related to some quality management practices, with control (i.e. public responsibility and compliance) having a significant effect throughout the studied models. Hospital goal setting and funding, two additional publicness dimensions, are not significantly related to quality management practices. The results of this study build our understanding of how operations practices are used in public organizations and help to define the extent to which publicness matters. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chesteen, S; Helgheim, B; Randall, T; Wardell, D				Chesteen, S; Helgheim, B; Randall, T; Wardell, D			Comparing quality of care in non-profit and for-profit nursing homes: a process perspective	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						process quality; hierarchical linear models; Baldrige Award	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; FIRM PERFORMANCE; MEDICAID; PROGRAMS; BEHAVIOR; COST; TQM	Using data from a sample of nursing homes, this paper uses an operations centric approach to test the economic hypothesis asserting that quality in non-profit healthcare entities will exceed quality in for-profit counterparts [Arrow, K., 1963. Uncertainty and welfare economics of medical care. The American Economic Review, 5, 941-973]. For-profit healthcare entities face an inherent conflict between providing profits to investors and health welfare to patients. Thus, non-profit entities exist as a signal and evidence of higher quality services. To date, research examining differences in quality between for-profit and non-profit nursing homes has focused on a direct link between outcome quality and non-profit status. These studies have produced inconclusive or mixed results. We argue that non-profit or for-profit status and outcome quality are linked via two Intermediate factors, namely process quality and input quality. Consistent with many prior studies, we report no direct link between non-profit status and outcome quality. However, we report that process quality is indeed higher at non-profit nursing homes than for-profit nursing homes, but that input quality is lower. We also examine the association between outcome quality with process and input quality. We report that different aspects of process quality are tied to better outcome quality, but report several notable exceptions. This research provides support for Arrow's hypothesis at the process level and gives insights into the link between process quality, input quality and outcome quality in the nursing home environment.

J	Benton, WC; Maloni, M				Benton, WC; Maloni, M			The influence of power driven buyer/seller relationships on supply chain satisfaction	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; influences of power on satisfaction; supplier satisfaction	DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS; INFLUENCE STRATEGIES; MARKETING CHANNEL; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; CONSEQUENCES; SERVICES; IMPACT	Research on supplier satisfaction in buyer-supplier relationships has been primarily conceptual. One purpose of the research described in this paper is to empirically test the influences of supply chain power on supplier satisfaction. Exploration of the effects of power on factors of supplier satisfaction will provide the key to understanding the power-satisfaction link in supply chain relationships. This paper shows how the buyer-seller relationship affects supplier satisfaction. In doing so, previous satisfaction and power literature is pulled together to demonstrate that the power-satisfaction variable must be included in any examination of supply chain partnerships. The three primary objectives of this research are to establish how the different "bases of power" affect the satisfaction of selling firms, investigate how power driven relationships affect supplier satisfaction, and measure the effect of power influences on supplier satisfaction in the automobile industry. Each of these research objectives was achieved. This study establishes the first empirical evidence for the measurement of power-driven supplier satisfaction. In each of the nine models studied, the power-affected buyer-supplier relationship was found to have a significant positive effect on both performance and satisfaction. The paths between performance and satisfaction, however, were consistently found to be nonsignificant. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jambulingam, T; Kathuria, R; Doucette, WR				Jambulingam, T; Kathuria, R; Doucette, WR			Entrepreneurial orientation as a basis for classification within a service industry: the case of retail pharmacy industry	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service management; entrepreneurial orientation; intangible resources; operations strategy; competitive advantaged; classification scheme; taxonomy	MANUFACTURING STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; MARKETING CHANNELS; ADVANTAGE THEORY; PERFORMANCE; DIMENSIONS; TAXONOMY; CONFIGURATIONS; DETERMINANTS; ENVIRONMENTS	To date, service classification research has primarily taken a macro view, creating service typologies or taxonomies by using dimensions such as customer contact or degree of labor intensity. Such classification schemes, though helpful in deciphering critical management issues and positioning strategies between service industries, tend to treat an entire industry, such as airlines, as a single homogenous entity. However, organizations in the same industry often use intangible resources, such as entrepreneurial orientation processes, to compete with one another. Resource-advantage theory suggests that organizations utilize intangible resources to build long-term strategies and a sustainable competitive advantage leading to superior performance. We developed organization clusters based on entrepreneurial orientation as intangible resources to classify organizations within a retailing industry. Using data from the retail pharmacy industry, we tested if the entrepreneurial orientations of the resultant groups within the pharmacy industry were related to their perception of the environment, organizational factors, and performance outcomes. The operationalization of the construct of entrepreneurial orientation is one of the contributions of the study. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the conceptual level, we reposition and reframe the "universality of TQM" question in light of two conflicting theoretical perspectives in the international business literature - one that supports the universal applicability of TQM (i.e., the Convergence Hypothesis argument) and another that questions the universal applicability of TQM (i.e., the National Specificity argument). We do so to provide a stronger theoretical basis for the "universality of TQM" question and to motivate and initiate a "strong inference" epistemological approach [Platt, J.R., 1964. Strong inference. Science 146 (364), 347-353] to examine, at the empirical level, the applicability of TQM across multiple countries. For this empirical assessment, we compare both the adoption levels of the Deming-based TQM constructs and the patterns of Deming-based TQM relationships among German, Italian, Japanese, and USA plants, using secondary data from 143 plants in Round Two of the World-Class Manufacturing project. After assessing measurement quality (i.e., reliability and validity) and measurement equivalence (i.e., translation, calibration, and metric), MANOVA analysis and regression analysis were deployed to derive relevant empirical results empirical results that have implications not only for the question of whether or not TQM is universal in its applicability but also for the theoretical tension between the Convergence Hypothesis argument and the National Specificity argument.

J	Elango, B				Elango, B			The influence of plant characteristics on the entry mode choice of overseas firms	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision; manufacturing strategy; empirical research	TRANSACTION COST INFLUENCES; FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; UNITED-STATES; JOINT-VENTURES; MULTINATIONAL FIRMS; TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER; JAPANESE INVESTORS; NATIONAL CULTURE; KNOWLEDGE; LOCATION	One of the most important strategic decisions a manufacturing firm makes while expanding overseas is making the choice between setting up greenfield operations or acquiring a local firm. Using a knowledge-based framework, I propose that the ability to transfer knowledge and competencies across national boundaries is much easier in plants characterized by physical capital investment. Hence, during overseas entry, manufacturing firms are likely to use greenfield operations. On the other hand, in plants characterized by human capital investment, the difficulty in transferring knowledge and the need to learn and adapt to host nation requirements will make a local acquisition the preferred mode of entry by manufacturing firms. Using 682 entry decisions made by manufacturing firms during entry into the U.S., I investigate this notion while controlling for size of the industry, research intensity of the industry, degree of unionization, cultural distance, and the value of investment. Study findings indicate that in plants characterized by human capital intensity, the preferred entry mode is acquisitions over greenfield operations. However, foreign entrants with physical capital-intensive plants prefer greenfield operations over acquisitions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lejeune, MA; Yakova, N				Lejeune, MA; Yakova, N			On characterizing the 4 C's in supply chain management	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Review							ENTERPRISE LOGISTICS; INTERDEPENDENCE; TRUST; NETWORKS; CONFIGURATIONS; PARTNERSHIPS; PERSPECTIVE; INVENTORY; DYNAMICS; MODELS	Supply chain management is a field at the confluence of many other disciplines; it has been studied under a number of perspectives, which has played a role for the crossbreeding of the discipline. In this paper, we propose a typology of supply chain configurations that contributes to tie together terms that have been used disjointedly for describing various forms of supply chain. It also enables researchers to develop theories related to the identified typology, rather than continue expanding efforts on separate, unconnected studies. The typology is configurational, consistent, and based on the correspondence (Sheppard and Sherman, 1998) between Fiske's theory of relational forms (1990) and the concept of interdependence, analyzed in the context of supply chain management. Our framework encompasses four main configurations - the communicative, coordinated, collaborative, and co-opetitive - and we refer to these as the 4 C's in supply chain management. We discuss the benefits of the proposed typology from managerial and research perspectives, and suggest some research extensions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
