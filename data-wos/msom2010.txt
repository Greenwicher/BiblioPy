OM Practice Work Expands to Fill the Time Available: Capacity Estimation and Staffing Under Parkinson's Law	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity planning; service operations; empirical research; OM-human resources interface	SYSTEMS; SERVICE; DEMAND	We develop a method to estimate the capacity of agents who answer e-mail in a contact center, given aggregate historical data that have been distorted both by constraints on work availability and by internal incentives to slow down when true capacity exceeds demand. We use the capacity estimate to find a contact center's optimal daily staffing levels. The implementation results, from an actual contact center, demonstrate that the method provides accurate staffing recommendations. We also examine and test models in which agents exhibit speed-up behavior and in which capacity varies over time. Finally, we use the capacity estimates to examine the implications of solving the staffing problem with two different model formulations, the service-level constraint formulation used by the contact center and an alternate profit-maximization formulation.

J	Liu, SX; So, KC; Zhang, FQ				Liu, Shaoxuan; So, Kut C.; Zhang, Fuqiang			Effect of Supply Reliability in a Retail Setting with Joint Marketing and Inventory Decisions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply uncertainty; inventory; marketing and operations interface; information technology; stochastic orderings	RECORD INACCURACY; OPERATIONS; CHAIN; REPLENISHMENT; COORDINATION; MANAGEMENT; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; YIELD	This paper studies the impact of supply reliability on a retail firm's performance under joint marketing and inventory decisions. The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort.

J	Lai, GM; Debo, LG; Sycara, K				Lai, Guoming; Debo, Laurens G.; Sycara, Katia			Buy Now and Match Later: Impact of Posterior Price Matching on Profit with Strategic Consumers	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						strategic consumers; inventory management; pricing; discounts; rational expectations equilibrium	RATIONAL-EXPECTATIONS; CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR; GUARANTEES; MONOPOLY; POLICIES	With a posterior price matching (PM) policy, a seller guarantees to reimburse the price difference to a consumer who buys a product before the seller marks it down. Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers' valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers' perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the seller's and the consumers' payoffs is possible. Finally, we find that the ability to credibly commit to a fixed price path is not very valuable when the seller can implement price matching.

Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.

J	Chen, ZL; Hall, NG				Chen, Zhi-Long; Hall, Nicholas G.			The Coordination of Pricing and Scheduling Decisions	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						scheduling; pricing; optimal and approximate algorithms; value of coordinating decisions	CONSTANT PRICED GOODS; SUPPLY CHAIN; EOQ MODEL; DEMAND; TRANSPORTATION; CAPACITY; PRODUCT; FLEXIBILITY; INCENTIVES; SELECTION	This paper considers the coordination of pricing and scheduling decisions in a make-to-order environment. Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem. Our main managerial insight is that there is a significant benefit even if pricing and scheduling are only heuristically or partially coordinated.

J	Jiang, L; Wang, YZ				Jiang, Li; Wang, Yunzeng			Supplier Competition in Decentralized Assembly Systems with Price-Sensitive and Uncertain Demand	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; noncooperative games; assembly systems; price-production decisions	COOPERATION; DECISIONS; CHAINS	In a decentralized assembly supply chain, independent suppliers produce a set of complementary components from which an assembler assembles a final product and sells it to the market. In such a channel, several competitive forces interact with one another to affect the price and quantity decisions of the firms involved. These include: (1) the direct competition each supplier faces for producing the same component, (2) the indirect competition among the suppliers producing the set of complementary components needed for assembling the final product, and (3) the vertical interaction between the assembler and the component suppliers. This paper shows that the direct competition that one supplier faces helps improve the performance of the assembler and all the other suppliers in the channel; and surprisingly, it can help improve the performance of this particular supplier facing the competition as well. Second, the assembler benefits from a merger of suppliers producing different components in the complementary set. Furthermore, the assembler prefers a merger of suppliers with less direct competition over a merger of suppliers with more direct competition.

J	Jiang, L; Anupindi, R				Jiang, Li; Anupindi, Ravi			Customer-Driven vs. Retailer-Driven Search: Channel Performance and Implications	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multilocation system; competition; search; inventory; pricing; information systems	2-LOCATION INVENTORY MODEL; TRANSSHIPMENT; PRICE; COMPETITION	A common phenomenon that occurs in any decentralized multilocation system is stock imbalance, whereby some locations have unsatisfied demands while others are overstocked. The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).

J	Jain, A; Groenevelt, H; Rudi, N				Jain, Aditya; Groenevelt, Harry; Rudi, Nils			Continuous Review Inventory Model with Dynamic Choice of Two Freight Modes with Fixed Costs	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						continuous review policy; lead times; freight mode selection; transportation economies of scale	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; OPTIMAL POLICIES; LEAD TIMES; SYSTEMS; ORDERS	We analyze a continuous review (Q, r) stochastic inventory model in which orders placed with a make-to-order manufacturer can be shipped via two alternative freight modes differing in lead time and costs. The costs of placing an order and using each freight mode consist of fixed components and hence exhibit economies of scale. We derive an optimal policy for using the two freight modes for shipping each order. This freight-mode decision is delayed until manufacturing is complete and the optimal policy uses information about the demand incurred in the meantime. Furthermore, given that the two freight modes are used optimally for shipping each order, we solve our model for reorder point and order quantity that minimizes cost. We analyze the cost savings achieved from postponing the freight-mode decision and provide analytical and numerical comparisons between the solutions to our two-freight model and single-freight models. Finally, we illustrate the properties of the solution to our model using an extensive set of numerical examples.

Feasting on Leftovers: Strategic Use of Shortages in Price Competition Among Differentiated Products	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; quality management; service operations	DEMAND; CAPACITY; MODELS; COSTS; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; DUOPOLY; FIRMS; TIME	Two single-product firms with different quality levels and fixed limited capacities engage in sequential price competition in an essentially deterministic model where customers have heterogeneous valuations for both products. We develop conditions under which the leader (she) can take strategic advantage of her limited capacity by pricing relatively low, purposefully creating shortages and leaving some leftovers for the follower (him) to feast on, avoiding direct competition. The extent to which the leader benefits in this Leftovers Equilibrium depends on operational variables such as the capacity levels of the two firms and the sequence in which customers arrive at the market. We spell out the details for three different known arrival sequences within a specific subset of plausible fixed-capacity levels.

Unlike statisticians, managers are typically more interested in the performance of a decision rather than the statistical validity of the underlying model. We propose a framework and a statistical test that incorporate decision performance into a measure of statistical validity. Under general conditions on the objective function, asymptotic behavior of our test admits a sharp and simple characterization. We develop our approach in a revenue management setting and apply the test to a data set used to optimize prices for consumer loans. We show that traditional model-based goodness-of-fit tests may consistently reject simple parametric models of consumer response (e. g., the ubiquitous logit model), while at the same time these models may "pass" the proposed performance-based test. Such situations arise when decisions derived from a postulated (and possibly incorrect) model generate results that cannot be distinguished statistically from the best achievable performance-i.e., when demand relationships are fully known.

S. plants. Although suppliers are responsible for shipping enough inventory to meet total needs across all production sites, Dell can reroute and expedite their shipments while in transit, and also transfer on-hand inventory in order to balance supply across sites. This paper describes the development, implementation, and impact of the process and optimization-based control system now used by Dell to address this supply-routing challenge for its U. S.-bound monitors. In a first phase, Dell created a new job definition focused solely on supply routing and implemented a supporting visualization tool. In a second phase, a decision support system relying on a mixed-integer programming formulation was implemented, overcoming two main challenges: (i) the estimation of shortages as a function of expected inventory, accounting for actual forecast quality; and (ii) the estimation of a meaningful shortage cost. This new methodology is estimated to have reduced Dell's inventory-repositioning costs for monitors by about 60%.

Leadtime-Variety Tradeoff in Product Differentiation	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						product variety; mass customization; make-to-order; make-to-stock; congestion; leadtime; custom and standard products; product differentiation	MAKE-TO-STOCK; PRODUCTION-INVENTORY SYSTEM; MASS CUSTOMIZATION; ORDER; COMPETITION; DECISIONS; BENEFITS; MODEL	The literature on mass customization generally focuses on the tradeoff between higher revenues from better matching customer preferences with product specifications, and higher costs of offering a broader-possibly fully customized-product line. Less well understood is the tradeoff between the increased ability to precisely meet customer preferences and the increased leadtime from order placement to delivery often associated with customized products. In this paper, we use a locational customer choice model to formulate a firm's integrated product line design problem that involves variety, leadtime (or inventory), and pricing decisions. We propose a dynamic programming based solution procedure that amounts to solving a shortest path problem on an acyclic network, and derive some structural results on the optimal product line de sign. We find that unimodal preferences generally result in hybrid product lines, with standard products clustering around the mode and custom products covering the tails, in contrast with the all-custom or all-standard product lines that are optimal under uniform preferences. We also numerically examine how the firm should adjust its leadtime and variety in response to changes in parameters such as customer dispersion and operational scale. We find that the tradeoff between leadtime and variety is sometimes nonintuitive and complex.

Even large suppliers (e. g., Delphi) could file for bankruptcy, and manufacturers' actions, such as financial subsidies to suppliers, profoundly affect suppliers' financial health. Using a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model of the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidy decisions and a general firm-value model of the supplier's financial state, this paper addresses the following questions: What is the optimal joint capacity ordering and financial subsidy policy for the manufacturer? Must subsidy and capacity ordering decisions be made jointly? How good are the recommendations from the traditional procurement models, which ignore the benefits of controlling the supplier's financial state through subsidies? The paper presents general assumptions that allow the manufacturer to make ordering decisions independent of subsidy decisions and investigates interactions between ordering and subsidy decisions when these assumptions are violated. Conditions are presented for the optimal subsidy policy to have a "subsidize-up-to" structure and for the optimal ordering decisions to be newsvendor fractiles.

J	Zhang, FQ				Zhang, Fuqiang			Procurement Mechanism Design in a Two-Echelon Inventory System with Price-Sensitive Demand	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						procurement; supply contracts; mechanism design; inventory models; asymmetric information	SUPPLY CHAIN; MULTIDIMENSIONAL AUCTIONS; ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; CONTRACTS; QUANTITY; POLICIES; UNCERTAINTY; DELIVERY; MODEL	This paper studies a buyer's procurement strategies in a two-stage supply chain with price-sensitive demand. The buyer procures a product from a supplier and then sells to the marketplace. Market demand is stochastic and depends on the buyer's selling price. The supplier's production cost is private information, and the buyer only knows the distribution of the cost. Both the buyer and the supplier can hold inventories to improve service, and a periodic-review inventory system is considered. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement mechanism: quantity attribute (i.e., the total purchase quantity) and service-level attribute (i.e., the supplier's delivery performance). We first identify the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer, which consists of a nonlinear menu of contracts for each of the two attributes. It can be shown that the optimal mechanism induces both a lower market demand and a lower service level compared to the supply chain optimum. In view of the complexity of the optimal mechanism, we proceed to search for simpler mechanisms that perform well for the buyer. We find that the above two attributes have different implications for procurement mechanism design: The value of using complex contract terms is generally negligible for the service-level attribute, whereas it can be highly valuable for the quantity attribute. In particular, we demonstrate that a fixed service-level contract, which consists of a target service level and a price-quantity menu, yields nearly optimal profit for the buyer. Additionally, the price-quantity menu is essentially a quantity discount scheme widely observed in practice.

The objective is to optimize responsiveness, i.e., to minimize waiting in excess of a promised response time. We study how responsiveness is influenced by modeling decisions and solution methods that arise when solving the dynamic problem by repeatedly solving real-time problems. Most results are derived using a set-partitioning based solution approach, which is shown to perform best among considered alternatives. Our research is based on a large-scale real-life application regarding roadside service assistance.

J	Gallien, J; Weber, T				Gallien, Jeremie; Weber, Theophane			To Wave or Not to Wave? Order Release Policies for Warehouses with an Automated Sorter	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory theory and control; production planning and scheduling; dynamic programming; queueing theory; simulation	PICKING; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Batch (wave) release policies are prevalent in warehouses with an automated sorter, and take different forms depending on how batches released consecutively may overlap downstream in the sorter. Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U. S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy with the goal of maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold. Second, we leverage that model and data set to compare the performance of wave-based and waveless policies through simulation. The best waveless policy yields larger or equal throughput than the best wave-based policy in all scenarios considered, and thus appears to merit some consideration by practitioners.

J	Martinez-de-Albeniz, V; Lago, A				Martinez-de-Albeniz, Victor; Lago, Alejandro			Myopic Inventory Policies Using Individual Customer Arrival Information	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						state-dependent base-stock policies; single-unit decomposition approach	DEMAND PROCESSES; OPTIMALITY; SYSTEMS; PRODUCT; MODEL	In this paper, we investigate the optimality of myopic inventory replenishment policies in a periodic-review single-echelon system, with nonstationary, correlated, stochastic demand and cost, and nonincreasing stochastic prices. Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we provide certain general conditions on the demand and cost processes under which a myopic policy is optimal. Under these conditions, the optimal policy is a myopic state-dependent base-stock policy, which can be expressed in closed form as a base-probability policy. Specifically, the order associated with a given customer should be placed if and only if its arrival probability within the leadtime is higher than a threshold. Our results generalize earlier conditions for the optimality of myopic policies. Namely, we show that myopic policies can be optimal even when the demand is correlated or stochastically decreasing.

M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						newsvendor model; task context; heuristics; random choice	FEEDBACK; MODELS	Previous experimental work showed that newsvendors tend to order closer to mean demand than prescribed by the normative critical fractile solution. A recently proposed explanation for this mean ordering behavior assumes that the decision maker commits random choice errors, and predicts the mean ordering pattern because there is more room to err toward mean demand than away from it. Do newsvendors exhibit mean ordering simply because they make random errors? We subject this hypothesis to an empirical test that rests on the fact that the random error explanation is insensitive to context. Our results strongly support the existence of context-sensitive decision strategies that rely directly on (biased) order-to-demand mappings, such as mean demand anchoring, demand chasing, and inventory error minimization.

We first show that the problem is polynomially solvable and then develop several insights into the behavior of such systems and identify strategies for effectively managing them. A key driver for the extent of substitution is the ratio of changeover cost to the substitution cost associated with mean demand. The interaction between changeovers and substitution is most prominent when this ratio is neither too high nor too low. Furthermore, the value of this ratio also influences the length of an appropriate rolling horizon; an increase in the value of the ratio signals an increase in the length of a near-optimal rolling horizon. We identify a complementary relationship between substitution and changeover costs: When the changeover cost is large, it is better to invest in reducing the substitution cost and vice versa. As the holding cost of the substitutable product increases, substitution is (respectively, changeovers are) utilized more when the changeover (respectively, substitution) cost is large.

Project Management Contracts with Delayed Payments	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain management; game theory; product development and design	AGENTS; TEAMS; TIME	When managing projects with considerable uncertainty, such as those arising in construction, defense, and new product development, it is customary for a manufacturer (project manager) to offer contracts under which each supplier (contractor) receives a prespecified payment when she completes her task. However, there are recent cases in which the manufacturer imposes "delayed payment" contracts under which each supplier is paid only when all suppliers have completed their tasks. By considering a model of one manufacturer and n >= 2 identical and independent suppliers with exponential completion times, we analyze the impact of both a delayed payment regime and a no-delayed-payment regime on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's net profit in equilibrium. When the suppliers' work rates are unadjustable, we conjecture that the manufacturer is actually worse off under the delayed payment regime. However, when the suppliers' work rates are adjustable, we obtain a different result: the delayed payment regime is more profitable for the manufacturer either when the project revenue is sufficiently small or when the number of suppliers is sufficiently large.

They are also good at modeling demand for unrestricted fare class structures, which are widespread throughout the industry. However, there is little empirical research on the practicality and effectiveness of choice-based RM models. Toward this end, we report the results of a study of choice-based RM conducted with a major U. S. airline. Our study had two main objectives: (1) to assess the extent to which choice models can be estimated well using readily available airline data, and (2) to gauge the potential impact that choice-based RM could have on a sample of test markets. We developed a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that uses a variation of the expectation-maximization method to account for unobservable data. The procedure was applied to data for a test market from New York City to a destination in Florida. The outputs are promising in terms of the quality of the computed estimates, although a large number of departure instances may be necessary to achieve highly accurate results. These choice model estimates were then used in a simulation study to assess the revenue performance of the EMSR-b (expected marginal seat revenue, version b) capacity control policies and the current controls used by the airline relative to controls optimized to account for choice behavior. Our simulation results show 1%-5% average revenue improvements using choice-based RM. Although such simulated results must be taken with caution, overall our study suggests that choice-based revenue management is both feasible to execute and economically significant in real-world airline environments.

J	Secomandi, N				Secomandi, Nicola			On the Pricing of Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						pricing and revenue management; operations management/finance interface; econometric analysis; petroleum/natural gas industries; real options	OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT; OPTIONS; EQUILIBRIUM; VALUATION; MARKETS; INVESTMENTS; MODEL	Pipelines play a critical role in matching the supply and demand of natural gas. The pricing of their capacity is an important problem in practice for pipeline companies and the users of this capacity, which include shippers such as natural gas merchants, producers, and local distribution companies. This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it. This analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the evolution of natural gas prices is an important driver of operational performance in the pricing of pipeline capacity. The results of this paper have potential relevance for the pricing of the capacity of other commodity conversion assets.

J	Caro, F; Martinez-de-Albeniz, V				Caro, Felipe; Martinez-de-Albeniz, Victor			The Impact of Quick Response in Inventory-Based Competition	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; supply chain management; inventory competition; game theory; fast fashion	DEMAND SUBSTITUTION; MANUFACTURER; RETAILERS; PRODUCT; MODELS	We propose an extension of the competitive newsvendor model to investigate the impact of quick response under competition. For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitor's inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics. We confirm that quick response is more beneficial when demand uncertainty is higher or exhibits a higher correlation over time. We also find that the competitive advantage from quick response is larger when facing a slow response competitor, and interestingly, asymmetric competition can be desirable to both competitors.

J	Shang, KH; Zhou, SX; van Houtum, GJ				Shang, Kevin H.; Zhou, Sean X.; van Houtum, Geert-Jan			Improving Supply Chain Performance: Real-Time Demand Information and Flexible Deliveries	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						multi-echelon; periodic ordering; policy comparison; value of information; value of flexible deliveries	FIXED REPLENISHMENT INTERVALS; SERIAL INVENTORY SYSTEMS; ECHELON-STOCK R; ORDERING POLICIES; INSTALLATION; COSTS	In some supply chains, materials are ordered periodically according to local information. This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency.

In this paper, we introduce a framework that combines many-server heavy-traffic analysis with the notion of epsilon-Nash equilibrium and apply it to the study of equilibria in a market with multiple large-scale service providers that compete on both prices and response times. In an analogy to fluid and diffusion approximations for queueing systems, we introduce the notions of fluid game and diffusion game. The proposed framework allows us to provide first-order and second-order characterization results for the equilibria in these markets. We use our results to provide insights into the price and service-level choices in the market and, in particular, into the impact of market scale on the interdependence between these two strategic decisions.

The following questions are addressed: How many customer-service representatives are required (staffing), and when should cross-selling opportunities be exercised (control) in a way that will maximize the expected profit of the center while maintaining a prespecified service level target? We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another. We show that our joint staffing and control scheme is nearly optimal for large systems. Furthermore, it performs extremely well, even for relatively small systems.

M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; risk management; supply chain management	PROCESS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; DYNAMIC PROCESS IMPROVEMENT; INVENTORY MODELS; YIELD RANDOMNESS; DIVERSIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; CAPACITY; DEMAND; CHAINS; PERFORMANCE	Surveys suggest that supply chain risk is a growing issue for executives and that supplier reliability is of particular concern. A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand.

Exploiting Market Size in Service Systems	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service systems; pricing; capacity planning; large market size; nonlinear delay costs; convex delay costs	DELAY COSTS; SERVERS; QUEUE; DISCIPLINE; OPTIMALITY; SCALE	We study a profit-maximizing firm providing a service to price and delay sensitive customers. We are interested in analyzing the scale economies inherent in such a system. In particular, we study how the firm's pricing and capacity decisions change as the scale, measured by the potential market for the service, increases. These decisions turn out to depend intricately on the form of the delay costs seen by the customers; we characterize these decisions up to the dominant order in the scale for both convex and concave delay costs. We show that when serving customers on a first-come, first-served basis, if the customers' delay costs are strictly convex, the firm can increase its utilization and extract profits beyond what it can do when customers' delay costs are linear. However, with concave delay costs, the firm is forced to decrease its utilization and makes less profit than in the linear case. While studying concave delay costs, we demonstrate that these decisions depend on the scheduling policy employed as well. We show that employing the last-come, first-served rule in the concave case results in utilization and profit similar to the linear case, regardless of the actual form of the delay costs.

J	Yin, SY				Yin, Shuya			Alliance Formation Among Perfectly Complementary Suppliers in a Price-Sensitive Assembly System	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alliance formation; demand curvature; pass-through rate; assembly system	TO-ORDER SYSTEMS; COOPERATION; COMPETITION; COALITIONS; DECISIONS; CONTRACTS; COMPONENT; DEMAND; CHAINS	Independent parties that produce perfectly complementary components may form alliances (or coalitions or groups) to better coordinate their pricing decisions when they sell their products to downstream buyers. This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers' incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price. We also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium, e. g., sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes, the cost effect due to alliance formation (either cost savings or additional costs), and a system without an assembler.

J	Araman, VF; Popescu, I				Araman, Victor F.; Popescu, Ioana			Media Revenue Management with Audience Uncertainty: Balancing Upfront and Spot Market Sales	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						media planning; TV advertising; revenue management; capacity planning	RANDOM YIELDS; INVENTORY; DEMAND; ORDER; TELEVISION; PRODUCTS; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; REWORK	An important challenge faced by media broadcasting companies is how to allocate limited advertising space between upfront (forward) contracts and the spot market (referred to in advertising as the scatter market) to maximize profits and meet contractual commitments. We develop stylized optimization models of airtime capacity planning and allocation across multiple clients under audience uncertainty. In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season. Our results suggest that broadcasting companies should prioritize upfront clients according to marginal revenue per audience unit. We find that accepted upfront market contracts can be aggregated across clients and served in proportion to the audience demanded. Closed-form solutions are obtained in a static setting. These results remain valid in a dynamic setting, when considering the opportunity to increase allocation by airing make-goods during the broadcasting season. Our structural results characterize the impact of contracting parameters, time, and audience uncertainty on profits and capacity decisions. The results hold under general audience and spot market profit models. Overall, we find that ignoring audience uncertainty can have a significant cost for media capacity planning and allocation.

We compare a generalized delay cost structure, where a customer's delay cost depends on her service valuation, with the traditional additive delay cost structure, where the delay cost is independent of the customer's service valuation. Under the additive delay cost structure, service providers offer different prices and expected delays, but customers are indifferent between the providers. Under the generalized delay cost structure, when the providers have different capacity or operating costs, we obtain value-based market segmentation, whereby higher-value customers choose one provider and lower-value customers choose the other. We study how the delay cost parameters, the market size, and the service providers' costs affect the structure of the equilibrium.

Coordination of Outsourced Operations to Minimize Weighted Flow Time and Capacity Booking Costs	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						coordination; cooperative games; incentives; outsourcing; supply chain management; production planning and scheduling	SEQUENCING GAMES; COOPERATION; CONVEXITY	A set of manufacturers outsources certain operations to a single third party following the announcement of a booking price for each available day of production. Knowing these costs, manufacturers book available production days in a first-come-first-serve order to optimize their individual cost. The cost for each manufacturer consists of booking and work-in-progress costs, as expressed by the weighted flow time. When window booking is completed, the third party identifies a schedule that minimizes the total cost incurred by all manufacturers. This coordination reduces the total cost but may result in higher costs for a subset of manufacturers. For this reason, the third party devises a savings sharing scheme with which the monetary benefit for each manufacturer is greater. In this article we present algorithms for the problem considered, as well as savings-sharing schemes that make coordination a better alternative for all parties. The highlight of our experiments is that the costs of the production chain can be reduced by an average of 32% if one-third of the members let the third party cover their increased work-in-progress cost in exchange for 38%-53% of the total savings.

There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.

J	Dong, LX; Kouvelis, P; Su, P				Dong, Lingxiu; Kouvelis, Panos; Su, Ping			Global Facility Network Design with Transshipment and Responsive Pricing	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						global operations management; operations strategy; supply chain management; global facility network; transshipment; responsive pricing; newsvendor network	INVESTMENT STRATEGIES; FLEXIBLE RESOURCES; INVENTORY; FLEXIBILITY; CAPACITY; POLICIES; RISK	This paper considers the facility network design problem for a global firm that sells to two markets: the domestic market and a foreign market. Although the firm has to invest in capital-intensive production facilities and produce outputs in the face of demand and exchange rate uncertainties, it can postpone the transshipment, localization, and distribution of the output until after uncertainties are resolved. The key network design decisions faced by the firm are in which of the two markets to locate the capital-intensive production facilities and what the corresponding output levels should be. We provide the complete characterization of the optimal global facility network configuration for two types of global firms: a newsvendor with exogenously given selling prices and a firm with the. exibility of pricing responsively after uncertainties are resolved. Our study's focus is on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty and responsive pricing on facility network decisions. Compared with a newsvendor facing demand uncertainty only, the introduction of exchange rate uncertainty or the use of responsive pricing can increase the attractiveness of centralized production. A responsive-pricing firm's optimal network design differs from that of a newsvendor firm as follows. (1) The firm's network preference is less susceptible to the increase of localization costs. (2) The firm is less likely to switch from a network of regional production to a network of centralized production in response to the increasing size of one market. (3) Demand and exchange rate uncertainties can have opposite effects on its optimal centralized output when the nature of the random shocks they introduce to the firm's demand function is different: under the linear demand function, the optimal centralized output increases in the demand volatility when demand shock is additive, but it may decrease in the exchange rate volatility because the corresponding price shock is multiplicative. Interestingly, common to both types of firms, their network preferences, although sensitive to costs and mean demand and exchange rate, are robust to the demand and exchange rate volatilities, suggesting that transshipment-enabled output substitutability between the two markets diminishes the impact of increasing market volatilities on the network design decision.

J	Huang, X; Sosic, G				Huang, Xiao; Sosic, Greys			Transshipment of Inventories: Dual Allocations vs. Transshipment Prices	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory sharing; supply chain coordination; transshipment	EXISTENCE; MODEL; GAMES	We study a newsvendor game with transshipments, in which n retailers face a stochastic demand for an identical product. Before the demand is realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged at the end of the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit-transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs)-that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among "more asymmetric" retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are "more alike," but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e. g., high critical fractiles or lower demand variances).

For a good that has two periods of lifetime, we build a model that generalizes and/or subsumes many of the models in the literature and study the effectiveness of two intuitive heuristic (base-stock) replenishment policies combined with different substitution rules. For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the inventory of aged items, ordering a constant amount each period. Thus the benefit of pooling inventory for substitutable, perishable products depends critically on the replenishment policy used.

A Comparison of Traditional and Open-Access Policies for Appointment Scheduling	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; health-care management	SINGLE-SERVER SYSTEM; NO-SHOWS; ARRIVAL TIMES; PRIMARY-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; QUEUES; OVERBOOKING; DELAYS; MODEL	This paper compares two types of appointment-scheduling policies for single providers: traditional and open-access. Under traditional scheduling, each of a specified number of patients per day is booked well in advance, but may not show up for his or her appointment. Under open-access scheduling, a random number of patients call in the morning to make an appointment for that same day. Thus the number of patient arrivals will be random, for different reasons, under both policies. We find that the open-access schedule will significantly outperform the traditional schedule-in terms of a weighted average of patients' waiting time, the doctor's idle time, and the doctor's overtime-except when patient waiting time is held in little regard or when the probability of no-shows is quite small.

Dynamic Scheduling of Outpatient Appointments Under Patient No-Shows and Cancellations	M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						service operations; health-care management; stochastic methods	ADVANCED ACCESS; HEALTH-CARE; OVERBOOKING; ALLOCATION; SYSTEM; MODEL	This paper develops a framework and proposes heuristic dynamic policies for scheduling patient appointments, taking into account the fact that patients may cancel or not show up for their appointments. In a simulation study that considers a model clinic, which is created using data obtained from an actual clinic, we find that the heuristics proposed outperform all the other benchmark policies, particularly when the patient load is high compared with the regular capacity. Supporting earlier findings in the literature, we find that the open access policy, a recently proposed popular scheduling paradigm that calls for "meeting today's demand today," can be a reasonable choice when the patient load is relatively low.
