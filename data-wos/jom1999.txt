Relationships among underlying dimensions of human resource management practices and manufacturing performance are examined. The study found support for the proposed framework, suggesting that human resource management practices can be grouped into five distinct factors, four of which are associated with specific manufacturing competitive dimensions (quality, flexibility, cost and time). The remaining HRM factor is generic. The four priority-specific HRM factors are strongly related to their respective manufacturing performance dimensions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kathuria, R; Partovi, FY				Kathuria, R; Partovi, FY			Work force management practices for manufacturing flexibility	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations strategy; flexibility; work force management; empirical research	STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE; TECHNOLOGIES; CULTURE; SYSTEM; LINK	Manufacturing flexibility can be a critical source of competitive advantage, yet the literature on work force management in an environment of high emphasis on flexibility is scant. This paper attempts to identify which work force management practices contribute to better managerial performance when the emphasis on flexibility is high. A contingency model depicting a moderating effect of the emphasis on flexibility on the relationship between work force management practices and managerial performance is proposed. The theoretic-deductive approach is used to develop the study hypotheses, which are tested using data from 483 individuals in 99 manufacturing plants in the United States. The results of the regression analyses suggest that the better performing manufacturing managers strongly demonstrate the relationship-oriented practices, such as team building, supporting, networking, inspiring, recognizing, etc., and participative leadership and delegation practices, when the emphasis on flexibility is high. Furthermore, as the emphasis on flexibility increases, the higher performing manufacturing managers relegate their traditional responsibilities, such as monitoring, problem solving, etc., to their employees.

J	Bohn, RE; Terwiesch, C				Bohn, RE; Terwiesch, C			The economics of yield-driven processes	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						production yields; cost of quality; product cost; rework; ramp-up; location decisions; international operations	PRODUCTION SYSTEM; SEMICONDUCTOR; IMPROVEMENT; MANAGEMENT; NOISE	The economic performance of many modern production processes is substantially influenced by process yields. Their first effect is on product cost - in some cases, low-yields can cause costs to double or worse. Yet measuring only costs can substantially underestimate the importance of yield improvement. We show that yields are especially important in periods of constrained capacity, such as new product ramp-up. Our analysis is illustrated with numerical examples taken from hard disk drive manufacturing. A three percentage point increase in yields can be worth about 6% of gross revenue and 17% of contribution. In fact, an eight percentage point improvement in process yields can outweigh a US$20/h increase in direct labor wages. Therefore, yields, in addition to or instead of labor costs, should be a focus of attention when making decisions such as new factory siting and type of automation. The paper also provides rules fbr when to rework, and shows that cost minimization logic can again give wrong answers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gilbert, SM; Ballou, RH				Gilbert, SM; Ballou, RH			Supply chain benefits from advanced customer commitments	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						supply chain coordination; inventory; lead time	MODEL; VENDOR	Buyers are frequently encouraged through price discounts to buy in certain ways - purchase in large quantities or purchase in advance of their needs. Ideally, these pricing incentives can lead to lower costs for both the buyer and the seller. In this paper, a situation is examined where a steel distributor faces stiff competition in its highly undifferentiated service offerings and price is the primary factor in attracting sales. A model is developed that quantifies the benefits to the supplier from obtaining advanced commitments from downstream customers. This model can be used to suggest the maximum price discount that can be offered to customers to encourage them to commit to their orders in advance. Careful balancing of the advanced ordering time with the price discount can lead to cost reductions for both members of the supply channel. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

While the potential benefits of flexibility are familiar, the concept of flexibility itself is not well-understood. Neither practitioners nor academics agree upon, or know, how flexibility can be gauged or measured in its totality. Consequently, this study seeks to provide a framework for understanding this complex concept and to create a theoretical foundation for the development of generalizable measures for manufacturing flexibility. With this objective in mind, we first critically examine diverse streams of literature to define four constituent elements of flexibility: range number (R-W), range-heterogeneity (R-H), mobility (M), and uniformity (U). The R-H element is new, and has not been proposed before in prior literature. These four elements can be applied to consistently define different types or dimensions of flexibility. Definitions for 10 flexibility dimensions pertaining to manufacturing are thus obtained. These definitions serve a dual purpose. First, they capture the domain of flexibility. Second, we show in this study how these definitions can be used to generate scale items, thereby facilitating the development of generalizable manufacturing flexibility measures. Several research avenues that can be explored once such measures are developed are also highlighted. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pannirselvam, GP; Ferguson, LA; Ash, RC; Siferd, SP				Pannirselvam, GP; Ferguson, LA; Ash, RC; Siferd, SP			Operations management research: an update for the 1990s	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						operations management research; survey		The issue of operations management (OM) research agendas was first advanced in the literature in 1980 with updates and additions in 1981, 1987, and 1989. We believe that the time is ripe for an analysis of the OM research agenda in the decade of the 90's. In this study, we examine operations management research methodologies and output during the period 1992-1997. Amoako-Gyampah and Meredith [Amoako-Gyampah, K., Meredith, J.R., 1989. Journal of Operations Management 8, 250-262] published a study in which they examined operations management research output from 1982 through 1987. Our objectives are to examine the state of operations management research in the 1990s from the standpoint of topics and methodologies to look for trends, and to determine implications for future research. We assessed the state of research in operations management by examining the research topics addressed and the methodologies used in a subset of seven academic journals that are representative of publications in operations management research. We also surveyed pipeline research in the operations management area by analyzing the topics discussed in national conferences attended by operations management academicians and researchers. Our findings show some significant changes in the kind of research being performed in the 1990s vs. the 1980s. Greater interest in strategy and quality are now apparent in the literature. OM research in the 1990s is also more integrative in nature. We were surprised to find no apparent shift away from modeling solution methods nor any significant shift toward empirical methodologies.
