Past stumbling blocks for supply chain integration such as high transaction costs between partners, poor information availability, and the challenges of managing complex interfaces between functional organizations are all dissolving on the web. In this paper, we examine how the web is changing supply chain management. We present a survey of emerging research on the impact of e-business on supply chain management including descriptive frameworks, analytical models, empirical analysis, and case studies. We classify the work into three major categories: e-commerce, e-procurement, and e-collaboration.

In this paper, a mixed integer programming (MIP) ATP model is presented. This model can provide an order-promising and -fulfillment solution for a batch of orders that arrive within a predefined batching interval. A variety of constraints, such as raw material availability, production capacity, material compatibility, and customer preferences, are considered. Simulation experiments using the model investigate the sensitivity of supply chain performance to changes in certain parameters, such as batching interval size and customer order flexibility.

We model a single product with two demand classes, where one class requests a lower order fulfillment lead time but pays a higher price. Demand for each class follows a Poisson process. Inventory is fed by a production system with exponentially distributed build times. We study rationing policies in which the firm either blocks or backlogs orders for the lower priority customers when inventory drops below a certain level. We compare the performance of these rationing policies with a pure first-come, first-serve policy under various scenarios for customer response to delay: lost sales, backlog, and a combination of lost sales and backlog.

In addition, we determine for the online search and combined strategy the optimal number of suppliers to contact for a price quote, and analyze how it depends on the various cost and demand parameters. The main contribution of this paper is that it does not assume a single procurement strategy, but rather compares three alternatives.

J	Boyer, KK; Olson, JR				Boyer, KK; Olson, JR			Drivers of Internet purchasing success	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						e-commerce; purchasing; supply chain management; technology management; operations strategy	TECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; ACCEPTANCE; USAGE; WEB	The development of the Internet as a business tool over the past 5 years has been phenomenal, causing a period of chaos and creative destruction. E-commerce has been hyped as a catalyst for vast streamlining of the supply chain. Yet, in a time of such phenomenal change, the focus tends to be on the large picture. Many details of how a new technology should be or is employed tend to be unknown or ignored. However, as the technology matures and stabilizes, one of the primary factors that separate winners from losers is the way in which the technology is implemented and operated on a daily basis. This study examines the ways in which companies utilize the Internet to streamline their purchasing process. A survey of 416 customers of a major Internet retailer of commodity office supplies reveals important relationships between web site design, employee work environments, Internet strategy, and purchasing performance. Our sample of companies consists of firms that have ordered office supplies at least once using the Internet. Our data indicate that companies do realize performance benefits from utilizing the Internet as a purchasing tool. Furthermore, the data suggest factors that facilitate purchasing process improvements. These factors can be utilized by both buying and selling companies to improve their proprietary processes to maximize the benefits of e-commerce as a purchasing tool.

J	Tempelmeier, H				Tempelmeier, H			A simple heuristic for dynamic order sizing and supplier selection with time-varying data	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						purchasing; order sizing; supplier selection; heuristic	QUANTITY DISCOUNTS; PRICE BREAKS; LOT-SIZE	In this paper we consider the problem of supplier selection and purchase order sizing for a single item under dynamic demand conditions. Suppliers offer all-units and/or incremental quantity discounts, which may vary over time. Although the problem refers to a typical planning task of a purchasing agent, which is often solved without algorithmic assistance, in an eBusiness (B2B) environment, the need for the integration of an automatic performance of this planning task into a web-based procurement process becomes evident. A new model formulation for this problem is developed, and a simple but easily extendible heuristic procedure is presented and tested.

The main research goal was to design and implement a prototype e-business software component and carry out tests in several industrial users. The research effort resulted in the extended production data management system (EPMS), which supported the business processes of customer order management, subcontractor selection, and multi-site/multi-firm production orders release. The enablers of this software application were business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce technologies in the operating context of application service providers (ASPS).

The retailers sell differentiated goods and are endowed with some private demand information. The paper shows that the manufacturer's optimal strategy is independent of the type of downstream competition, Cournot or Bertrand, and that no information will be shared with the manufacturer on a voluntary basis. However, complete information sharing, which benefits all three parties, can be achieved through side payment when the retailers' information is statistically less accurate or when the leakage effect is more beneficial to the retailers.

These broader product lines may help to increase market share and may allow higher prices to be charged, but they also cause challenges associated with diseconomies of scope. To investigate this tradeoff, we considered a monopolist who faces demand curves, which for each of its potential products, decline with both price and response time (time to deliver the product). The firm must decide which products to offer, how to price them, whether each should be make-to-stock (NITS) or make-to-order (MTO), and how often to produce them. The offered products share a single manufacturing facility. Setup times introduce disceonomies of scope and Setup costs introduce economies of scale. We provide motivating problem scenarios, model the monopolist's problem as a non-linear, integer programming problem, characterize of the optimal policy, develop near-optimal procedures, and discuss managerial insights.

This model provides an alternative explanation for much of what other outsourcing theories predict, as well as making several new predictions. In particular, we show that outsourcing decisions can create a path-dependent outsourcing trap in which a firm experiences higher long-run costs after an immediate cost benefit. We also describe conditions under which outsourcing a small fraction of component production may dominate either complete insourcing or complete outsourcing. Finally, we show that, with discounting, there is a convex, curvilinear relationship between the optimal outsourcing fraction and the rate of technological change.

J	Graman, GA; Magazine, MJ				Graman, GA; Magazine, MJ			A numerical analysis of capacitated postponement	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						delayed product differentiation; postponement; flexible manufacturing; mass customization	INVENTORY; SERVICE	Customer satisfaction can be achieved by providing rapid delivery of a wide variety of products. High levels of product variety require correspondingly high levels of inventory of each item to quickly respond to customer demand. Delayed product differentiation has been identified as a strategy to reduce final product inventories while providing the required customer service levels. However, it is done so at the cost of devoting large production capacities to the differentiation stage. We study the impact of this postponement capacity on the ability to achieve the benefits of delayed product differentiation. We examine a single-period capacitated inventory model and consider a manufacturing system that produces a single item that is finished into multiple products. After assembly, some amount of the common generic item is completed as non-postponed products. whereas some of the common item is kept as in-process inventory, thereby postponing the commitment to a specific product. The non-postponed finished-goods inventory is used first to meet demand. Demand in excess of this inventory is met, if possible, through the completion of the common items. Our results indicate that a relatively small amount of postponement capacity is needed to achieve all of the benefits of completely delaying product differentiation for all customer demand. This important result will permit many firms to adopt this delaying strategy who previously thought it to be either technologically impossible or prohibitively expensive to do so.

J	Raman, A; Kim, B				Raman, A; Kim, B			Quantifying the impact of inventory holding cost and reactive capacity on an apparel manufacturer's profitability	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory planning; inventory management; working capital management; capacity management; dynamic programming	STYLE-GOODS; FORECAST REVISIONS; DEMAND	This paper was motivated by the operational problems faced by Northco, a school uniform manufacturer in the Northeastern United States. Northco was facing high working capital costs while also incurring high stockout and markdown costs. This paper models the impact of inventory holding cost and reactive capacity on Northco's targeted understocking and overstocking cost and offers a solution methodology for such problems. We quantify the impact of varying inventory carrying costs (and hence, high working capital costs) on stockout costs and the value of additional capacity. Our results illustrate that apparel manufacturers with high working capital costs, and hence high inventory carrying costs, should target higher stockout costs and achieve lower capacity utilization. The results presented have application beyond Northco because high working capital cost is endemic to many supply chains.

J	Tang, K; Tang, J				Tang, K; Tang, J			Time-based pricing and leadtime policies for a build-to-order manufacturer	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						build-to-order; pricing; leadtime; e-commerce	MANAGEMENT; DECISIONS; DEMAND	We studied time-based policies on pricing and leadtime for a build-to-order and direct sales manufacturer. It is assumed that the utility of the product varies among potential customers and decreases over time, and that a potential customer will place an order if his or her utility is higher than the manufacturer's posted price. Once an order is placed, it will be delivered to the customer after a length of time called "leadtime." Because of the decrease in a customer's utility during leadtime, a customer will cancel the order if the utility falls below the ordering price before the order is received. The manufacturer may choose to offer discounted prices to customers who would otherwise cancel their orders. We discuss two price policies: common discounted price and customized discounted price. In the common discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers a single lower price to the customers; in the customized discounted price policy, the manufacturer offers the customers separately for individual new prices. Our analytical and numerical studies show that the discounted price policies results in higher revenue and that the customized discounted price policy significantly outperforms the common discounted price policy when product utility decreases rapidly. We also study two leadtime policies when production cost decreases over time. The first uses a fixed leadtime. and the second allows the leadtime to vary dynamically over time. We find that the dynamic leadtime policy significantly outperforms the fixed leadtime policy when the product cost decreases rapidly.

When setting delivery guarantees, a firm must consider customer expectations as well as operational constraints. We develop a profit-maximization model in which a firm's sales organization, with incomplete information on operations' status, solicits orders and quotes delivery dates. If obtained, orders are processed in a make-to-order facility, after which revenue is received, minus tardiness penalty if the delivery was later than quoted. We specify conditions for an optimal log-linear decision rule and provide exact expressions for its effect on arrival rate, mean processing time, and mean cycle time.

J	Agrawal, VK				Agrawal, VK			Constituencies of journals in production and operations management: Implications on reach and quality	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						journals in POM; quality of journals; relevance of journals; research in POM		I analyzed the contributions made by members of the following constituencies in terms of the number of articles published in the Journal of Operations Management (JOM), Manufacturing and Service Operations Management (M&SOM), and Production and Operations Management (POM): the top 20 U.S. business schools and the top 7 non-U.S. business schools as ranked by Business Week or U.S. News and World Report, business and government organizations, U.S. business schools ranked between 21 and 50, non-U.S. business schools not included above, and U.S. business schools not included above. I also analyzed the contributions made by U.S. business schools with top 10 programs in production and operations management; 9 of which are also in the list of top 20 U.S. business schools. Authors from the schools with top 10 programs in production and operations management contributed 20.2% of the articles published in POM and 3.5% of the articles published in JOM during 1997-2001. They contributed 24.6% of the articles in the eight issues (from July 2000 through June 2002) of M&SOM. During these periods, authors from the top 27 schools contributed 29.3% of the articles published in POM, 9.4% of the articles published in JOM, and 37.4% of the articles to the eight issues of M&SOM. Also during the same periods, authors from business and government organizations contributed 6.6% of the articles published in POM, 1.9% of the articles published in JOM, and 5.8% of the articles published in the eight issues of M&SOM. The findings reported in this paper reflect the reach of the three journals and the perceptions of various constituencies regarding journal quality. The findings about POM and JOM have a very high degree of validity because both journals are more than 10 years old and have well-established constituencies. The conclusions about the M&SOM constituencies are tentative because it is about 3 years old, and it is still developing its constituencies.

The models in this paper explicitly evaluate the decision to utilize both predictive and periodic maintenance when the objective is to minimize expected maintenance costs per unit time. Renewal theory is used to obtain optimal policies as unique solutions of integral equations that depend on the failure distribution and prediction capabilities. Based on this research, we recommend that practitioners do not abandon the traditional maintenance methods but follow our guidelines for utilizing periodic maintenance in conjunction with the new technologies.

We consider a production process with two states: in control and out of control. The process may shift randomly to the out-of-control state over time. The process is monitored by periodically sampling finished items from the process. The equipment used to test sampled items also is assumed to have two states and may shift randomly during the testing process. We formulate a cost model for finding the optimal process control policy that minimizes the expected unit time cost. Numerical results show that shifts of the testing equipment may significantly affect the performance of a process control policy. We also studied the effects of the testing equipment's shifts on the selection of process control policies.

J	Goh, M; Sharafali, M				Goh, M; Sharafali, M			Price-dependent inventory models with discount offers at random times	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						inventory management; random discount offers; pricing; lot sizing	LOT-SIZE MODEL; RANDOM OPPORTUNITIES; REPLENISHMENT; VENDOR; ENVIRONMENT; PURCHASER; SUPPLIER; DEMAND	We consider an inventory model with a supplier offering discounts to a reseller at random epochs. The offer is accepted when the inventory position is lower than a threshold level. We compare three different pricing policies in which demand is induced by the reseller's price variation. Policy I is the EOQ policy without discount offers. Policy 2 is a uniform price, stock-independent policy. Policy 3 is a stock level-dependent, discriminated price policy. Assuming constant demand rates, expressions are obtained for the optimal order quantities, prices, and profits. The numerical experiments show that if it is better to accept a supplier's discount, then it benefits the reseller to transfer the discount to downstream customers.

The vendors differ in lead times, costs, and production flexibility. Product demand is uncertain and fluctuates over time. We develop an optimization model to choose the production commitments that maximize the retailer's expected gross profit, given demand forecasts and vendors' capacity and flexibility constraints. The model has been incorporated into a decision support system, developed in collaboration with supply chain planners at a global retailer of seasonal and fashion merchandise. The software has been tested by two major retailers.

The two locations may collaborate by moving inventory between them. The lateral transshipment times are shorter than the regular replenishment lead times, but they are not negligible. Several alter-native types of ordering and transshipment policies are examined. Extensive experimentation by simulation leads to the conclusion that the benefits of risk pooling are substantial only when demand is highly variable. Moreover, the type and variability of the demand distributions are key determinants of the appropriate transshipment policy and pooling groups design.

We consider a two-stage assemble-to-order system with two products having uniformly distributed demand, one common component, and product-specific components. We develop optimization models in which the cost-minimizing inventory of the components must be determined and allocated to products in order to meet product-specific service level constraints. We compare two different commonality models based on whether or not the products are prioritized. A distinctive feature of our study is the use of product-specific service levels. We compare our results with models using aggregate service levels.

The problem is to determine a schedule that minimizes the makespan for a given demand profile over a finite planning horizon. We propose a global procedure that utilizes genetic algorithms and three subproblems. The performance of the procedure is evaluated via experimentation over thousands of problem realizations that are randomly generated. The experimental results show the efficiency of the global procedure and provides qualitative answers to the allocation of machines to the various stages.

Using a GI/G/1 queuing network, we model the firm's decision to remanufacture an optimal product mix over the long run that maximizes profits while maintaining a desired service level. We further use simulation to explore dispatching heuristics that can be used at the shop-floor level to achieve the desired optimal product mix, while meeting the service level constraint. Our research is grounded in actual practice and the results provide key insights into the decision-making process required to maximize profits and minimize average flow times for remanufactured products.

J	Atwater, JB; Chakravorty, SS				Atwater, JB; Chakravorty, SS			A study of the utilization of capacity constrained resources in drum-buffer-rope systems	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						capacity management; production scheduling; bottleneck management; drum-buffer-rope; theory of constraints		Goldratt, the originator of the Theory of Constraints (TOC), maintains that only the system's primary resource constraint(s) should be scheduled at 100% of capacity. All other resources should have excess capacity. This paper presents the results of a simulation experiment that studies how changes in the capacity utilization of a system's two most heavily utilized resources affect the performance of a drum-buffer-rope (DBR)scheduling system. The research demonstrates that 100% utilization of the primary constraint is not optimal. It also shows that DBR responds well to relatively low levels of increased capacity at the operation's second most heavily utilized resource. This research also highlights several other issues related to capacity utilization that need further investigation.

J	Bowman, RA				Bowman, RA			Job release control using a cyclic schedule	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cyclic scheduling; job release control; inventory management; critical path; bottleneck	PRODUCTION-DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; REORDER INTERVALS; NETWORKS	In just-in-time inventory management in any manufacturing setting, the general idea has been to release jobs as late as possible (to reduce inventory costs) while still having them arrive at bottleneck machines in time to maintain the desired throughput (by not starving a bottleneck machine). When a cyclic schedule is employed, the throughput is determined by a cyclic sequence of operations known as the cyclic critical path. These operations are not, in general, all performed on a single bottleneck machine. We present an algorithm for releasing jobs that treats this cyclic critical path as the bottleneck. Although this algorithm has the somewhat complex task of not delaying any of these operations on the cyclic critical path, it is greatly simplified by being able to take advantage of the fixed sequence of the cyclic schedule. The result is that the algorithm is relatively simple to implement. Although it uses a simulation-based analysis, this analysis can all be done and the necessary results stored in advance of its use. We test the algorithm in a job shop environment with stochastic operation times. This algorithm is shown to be effective at reducing inventory while avoiding decreases in throughput.

J	Boyer, KK; Lewis, MW				Boyer, KK; Lewis, MW			Competitive priorities: Investigating the need for trade-offs in operations strategy	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competitive priorities; operations strategy; survey research/design	MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; PERFORMANCE RATINGS; HALO; MANAGEMENT; RELIABILITY; DIRECTIONS; VALIDITY	A heated debate continues over the need for trade-offs in operations strategy. Some researchers call for plants to focus on a single manufacturing capability and devote their limited resources accordingly, while others claim that advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) enables concurrent improvements in quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery. Yet there is little empirical evidence for or. against the trade-off model. In response, this study addresses the question: "To what extent do manufacturing plants view competitive priorities as trade-offs?" We employ survey data collected from managers and operators in 110 plants that have recently implemented AMT. Our findings suggest that trade-offs remain. However, perceived differences in competitive priorities are subtle and may vary across levels of the plant hierarchy.

J	Hayes, RH				Hayes, RH			Challenges posed to operations management by the "new economy"	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						New Economy; information technology; networks; outsourcing; POM pedagogy		A growing number of sophisticated observers are coming to believe that the forces driving the so-called New Economy are fundamentally reshaping world industry. Moreover, the combination of fast growth and the excitement associated with leading edge technologies has made New Economy companies magnets for management talent-and particularly for the ambitious young people who attend our management programs. Are we providing these potential managers with a good foundation for managing operations in such companies? Are the principles that we traditionally have taught in operations management (oM) courses sufficiently robust that they can still be applied to New Economy operations? In this paper we argue that, although some of our familiar concepts and techniques continue to be applicable to information-intensive operations, many are not. We sketch out a way to think conceptually about the important differences between the Old and the New Economies, and their implications for operations management teaching and research.

J	Mcafee, A				Mcafee, A			The impact of enterprise information technology adoption on operational performance: An empirical investigation	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						information technology adoption; performance impact of information; technology; operational effectiveness	PARADOX	This paper presents the results of a natural experiment conducted at a U.S. high-tech manufacturer. The experiment had as its treatment the adoption, at a single point in time, of a comprehensive enterprise information system throughout the functional groups charged with customer order fulfillment. This information technology (IT) adoption was not accompanied by substantial contemporaneous business process changes. Immediately after adoption, lead time and on-time delivery performance suffered, causing a "performance dip" similar to those observed after the introduction of capital equipment onto shop floors. Lead times and on-time delivery percentages then improved along a learning curve. After several months, performance in these areas improved significantly relative to preadoption levels. These observed performance patterns could not be well explained by rival causal factors such as order, production, and inventory volumes; head count; and new product introductions. Thus, this longitudinal research presents initial evidence of a causal link between IT adoption and subsequent improvement in operational performance measures, as well as evidence of the timescale over which these benefits appear.

The taxonomy is comprised of eight service process configurations. Analysis of publicly available data on on-line customer ratings for 52 retailers in the study sample shows that the ordering of the configurations in the taxonomy on a continuum of low to high flexibility is associated positively with (i) customer satisfaction with web site aesthetics, web site navigation, product selection, product information, customer support, and ease of return, and (ii) customer loyalty.

To cope with this new structure, the firm created highly skilled generalists, "supply-chain integrators," who coordinate product development, marketing, production, and logistics from product concept to delivery across firm boundaries. We particularly focus on the skill-set that characterizes these integrators. Finally, we use the case evidence, combined with previous theory, to suggest a specific program of research into coordinating product development across disaggregated supply chains.

Here I examine and illustrate a simple four-stage framework for thinking about these implications: advances in digital technology (stage 1) lead to business developments (stage 2), which impact the views of OM-relevant thought leaders (stage 3), which influence the conduct of OM activities (stage 4). This framework provides a perspective for viewing the evolution of OM and indicates how educators, researchers, and practitioners can steal the march on mainstream thinking.
